  first time here food tastes great good environment choice between mimi s or here is a hard one yet there is wifi here families galore i didn t bring my son yet i see lots of families eating here for what you get you could go to sunset station yet the service was fast and prompt when i am in the area it s now a good place to fill in the answer to what do you want to eat
  i have been craving burgers lately so i decided to try smashburger for the first time i am definitely not coming back the food presentation seemed legit when the servers brought our food to the table but their burgers and fries were drenched in grease didn t even want to finish my food and my table was filled with napkins from all that disgusting grease service was alright janelle took our order was a tad bit rude she didn t greet us but kept interrupting me as i was putting in my order by constantly saying for here or to go i obviously couldn t hear her because she made no effort to speak up daniel was nice enough to come around our table with a smile as he was cleaning up asked how the food was for us to enjoy the rest of our day
  i love having a place like this in the neighborhood the new management has cleaned it up and added great things to the menu like vegan biscuits gravy which are delicious this coming from a meat eater and it s open until 4am on weekends which makes it the perfect spot for a late night snack
  i had the morning monte which was delicious i never would of found out about this place without yelp it s in a residential area off the main road don t let that fool you though the food was good and staff was friendly the outside area was nice and they even had a macaw
  i have this app on my phone that lists the places near you where kids eat free on specific days it s usually full of sub par diners but when i saw rumbi s listed i had to jump on yelp to see what people had to say mixed reviews so i took a quick peek at the menu it sounded good so we decided to check it out the restaurant was fairly clean and a few other families were eating when we got there we perused the menu longer than we usually do but we didn t feel in the way or rushed in any way they have everything from rice and noodle bowls to burgers to sandwiches to seafood it was hard to decide i ordered the fish tacos and polished off the whole plate in no time the order came with two tacos type of fish not specified and rice with beans i seriously ate it so fast that i can t tell you what all was in it pretty sure the salsa was tomato onion pineapple and cilantro there may have been cabbage and a jalapeno ranch type sauce don t quote me on it though the rice and beans were really good and scented but i couldn t pinpoint the flavor very good though husband had the kahuna burger two patties pineapple swiss typical burger toppings with the rumbi fries regular and sweet potato the burger fell apart as most doubles do he really enjoyed it though kids had the chicken dippers and the orange honey chicken bowl i was surprised that both kids polished their food off since dinnertime can be somewhat of a battle as we were finishing up it started to get busy so we got there at a good time right before 6pm i can t wait to go back
  in n out is great i love their burgers and fries they have friendly staff every time i go there i was there today and their food is very good for the money my 2 old year loves going there because he get stickers keep up the good work in n out
  a local favourite byob beer wine the restaurant served a very nice french meal the service was a bit slow the food was excellently prepared
  i had zee most elegant evening here with my bf we celebrated our 2nd year anniversary here first of all i have never in my life had any kind of service like this before proper etiquette and everything when we came in to claim our reservations the host called us by our last names like mr santos it was pretty amazing since it was both our first times here we got to our table and the host automatically pulled out my chair for me and bonus was that she pulled out the chair i prefer sitting in which is facing out instead of facing the wall then she placed my cloth napkin over my lap our server came over and asked for our drinks they actually brought us out some complimentary champaign cordon negro to be exact he also explained how this whole process works basically there s this circle shaped card which is very important if you wanna eat the good stuff it s green on one side and red on the other red means you don t want to be served and green means bring it on this is for the men with swords of different types of meat walking from table to table but before i do speak of the main course our server pointed us to the salad bar this is no ordinary salad bar for the lack of words it was huge what amazed me most was that they actually had different types of cheeses and a small selection of sea food such as zesty shrimp and smoked salmon everything from there tasted just as good as the main course so not even half way into finishing our salads we decided to flip the card to green and these men with swords did not waste a second and came rushing over at almost every corner of the table there was filet mignon skirt steak lamb chops flank steak brazilian sausage parmesan chicken which was kinda dry and i think they should just stick to steak and my favorite of the night the garlic picanha our server brought out some mashed potatoes and these sweet bananas to cleanse our palates and i didn t even need my a1 sauce and amazingly we had room for a little taste of dessert after i mean it was our anniversary and you gotta end it right with dessert our server brought over a sample tray of all their desserts we decided on the brazilian cheesecake i don t know what makes it brazilian but it was pretty delicious if you re not really picky with steak but would love to explore the different cuts this place is a good start
  outdated decor slow and unfriendly service paid 130 for 2 people no cocktails for chinese food that was equivalent to a average chinese buffet save yourself the money and frustration and eat at beijing no 9
  what can i say other than wow we so enjoy our dining experience at tommy v s urban kitchen that we chose to introduce our friends to this fabulous restaurant this past saturday night as we entered we were given a warm reception from zoran the owner main person who greets you entering who then escorted us to the bar for a wonderful bottle of champagne from there we moved to the dining area to a nice quite table for 4 our entire dining experience was fabulous starting with the caprese appetizer right into our entrees of salads and pasta the service food and ambiance speak volumes i can honesty say their are very few places in scottsdale that deliver the whole package like tommy v s urban kitchen i recommend this location to any one looking for a great place for dinner entertaining client or a great place to hang with friends you will not be disappointed
  one cool thing about this place is that they brand a u on your burger but other than that its mediocore
  the food is amazing really good chinese and service the spicy shrimp and noodles are great so is the duck
  rao s has the best meatballs i order this as an app and i pretend i m at the original in ny this restaurant has such good energy with the christmas decorations pics and happy employees
  they have hoegaarden on tap aside from the amazing beer selection everyone is super friendly and the atmosphere is amazing don t forget about the boots if your party drinks 3 you get a free come back in t shirt the late night menu is superb as well burgers fries or other snacks for only 3
  i tried the oyster shooter their fried calamari wow sooo good
  they have a really great happy hour i hate that it s only 4 6 most places are 3 7 but the food is very good and the drinks are cheap i ll definitely come back
  i have been eating here for 15 years and the food is better and better every time i was so lucky the restaurant opened up after hours to host my rehearsal dinner for my wedding they customized menus and even had gluten free selections for me we really wanted breakfast under the stars and the whole crew made that possible the food was amazing the service was impeccable the care and concern everyone put forth will be treasured we were so pleased with everything that we returned to the us egg on wednesday for breakfast tempe location no matter what location you are at you will have a great meal service and experience i highly recommend us egg you can t go wrong with the protein cakes skillets and more thanks gebran for amazing me we are so fortunate you agreed to do so much for us may your kindness be returned 10 fold
  a whole lotta oysters and yes they are good
  got a burger with green and white mild on the bun took 2 bites before i realized it also the soda machine was disgusting never eating there again the new mcdonald s out in the parking lot is much better
  kind of hidden in a non descript shopping strip this mom pop place is a great find i ve only tried their meats beef lamb and chicken lamb is the best the choices are kind of limited seems like half the menu are kebabs but they are so tasty if the prices look a bit high the portions that come out justify that the grilled meats rest on a huge plate of flavored rice i can usually save half for lunch the next day some of their desserts look tempting but i never have room for them maybe i will order some to take out next time
  hands down the best flour tortillas i have ever had i had a carne asada burrito and i couldn t tell you what the meat tasted like because all i can remember is that tortilla it was soft thick and flavorful it definitely made the burrito
  they are nice fast and i didn t get sick i gave them the stars i gave them for that the sushi is sub par now even though years ago this place was awesome i look at the good reviews and they talk about how easy it is to get a table hello don t you wonder why they aren t busy the good news is that if you think this is good sushi someday you re going to try good sushi and be like wow
  ordered the oxtail stew and it was the best i ve had in az very flavorful plenty of juice and super delicious i did order potato salad on the side but got cabbage instead it was pretty good staff wasn t very friendly but not rude at all just felt rushed
  to me a place like this makes me a true yelp follower had an inkling for a burger at lunch today being new to the area i was looking for an in and out burger fortunately i did not find one immediately near buy what i did find was that yelp and yelpers were telling me to i had to check out this place yes it was off my route by 1 1 2 miles but if a burger shop can get 4 1 2 stars it must be worth the effort i found about 10 parking spaces in the rear no street parking as indian school rd is a busy one i entered the fully customized and highly decorated shop that can t be more than 20 feet across the outside front patio porch had counter space for 8 10 people no tables counters the interior had space for another 8 10 people with only 1 or 2 tables to speak of the other spots were also counters with stools the menu is short but to me that means they focus on what is important you come for a burger you will get a burger no distracting other extras though they do offer wings which i will try one day i was greeted by a guy who absolutely knows something about customer service he greeted me as soon as i came in handed me a menu asked if i had questions and offered to help he shared that they had a 5 special of bacon cheeseburger fries and a canned drink i took him up on it he asked me what kind of cheese at least 4 choices there or to go and my name he had me take a seat and he brought my burger and fries to my counter spot outside he offered a few times a ranch dressing i declined until i figured out it must be something special he shared that they make their own buttermilk ranch dressing for the fries i took him up on his offer it was a fine addition to the fries previously salted with seasoned salt the burger was good it is a simple 1 3 lb i did not notice a grilled taste but he lettuce and tomato were fresh the grilled onions were a plus i had a great burger and fries 1 star i had great customer service 1 star i had a great value meal 1 star i had a great visit to a quaint interesting business 1 star my only reservations are these the hours are only 10 am 4 20 pm what am i going to do for dinner or late evening snacks tight eating quarters i was there at 11 20 and it was already filling up what would i do on a friday at 12 15 small parking lot shared by other stores next time i try the mushroom burger and the time after that i will try the fat burger two patties
  went tonight with the family for dinner service is below average and has been for years the part that really got me was that i ordered fajitas with no sour cream my wife asks for a side of sour cream they charge us for the side my son and i ask for more tortillas as they give you only 2 the waiter takes 5 min to bring out the wrong thing then another 5 before he brings the right tortillas food cold at this point they then proceed to charge for extra tortillas don t nickel and dime your customers especially when you screw up great president bush ate there we get it he also ate at a million other places get your act together
  love the old school charm of the place had a corn bread pancake a serve of griddle and the reuben omelette the omelette comes highly recommended and it does live up to its reputation friendly service and homely atmosphere it s cash only though
  i have been wanting to try this place since it opened i ve heard some good reviews from friends and seen on yelp i also heard this place is run by former nobu chef i have some friends in town and decided to try this place last night we had a large group of people there was 18 of us we made the reservation prior since it was for so many of us when we got there the table has not been set up yet we waited for them to arrange our table after we sat down it took our server four times back and forth to get our drink order right he kept forgetting what we ordered and we only ordered either hot tea ice tea or water i really didn t think it was that difficult then we ordered by section for the food and asked to split the check by section some sections got appetizers and their main entrees while some other didn t even get their appetizers yet they forgot quite a few things that we ordered and we had to keep asking the sever wasn t apologetic at all when we asked our missing orders after we got our check it wasn t the way we asked to split either overall services was 2 out of 5 for me and it ruined everyone s experiences most of my friends said they would not go back i feel kind of embarrassed by recommending this place for us to try food 1 salmon tacos 3 5 5 it was average nothing really special about it 2 rock shrimp with yuzu sauce 3 5 5 it was average too nothing great about this either kinda like honey walnut shrimp but not as good 3 catalina island uni 4 5 5 i love uni from catalina island they have pretty fresh ones here 4 chilean sea bass 3 5 5 the cilantro dressing was not flavorful enough for me sea bass was fresh 5 truffle bone marrow 4 5 it was pretty good except it was bit salty for my taste and i couldn t use any of the seasoning that came with cuz it was bit salty already 6 japaneiro fried rice 4 5 it was pretty good combination fried rice all in all i would not recommend to come here with big groups i like the food but i was not in love with the stuff i ve tried i may come again in the future and try other stuff on the menu when they have a system in place and with a smaller group
  decided to come and give them another try no food on buffet service almost suck but to top it all off they the workers were changing a baby s shirt dipper on one of the back tables nasty last visit ever
  slow service that forgot ordered items food is average at best and pricey you can get a larger size and better tasting short ribs at ono hawaiian for 7 bucks less
  what a gem of a find i m from la and came for thanksgiving to see my family and chef sarah has made it possible for me to eat amazing raw food my entire trip chef sarah sits down at the table and carefully explains everything on the menu at this quaint little wood cottage restaurant i ve eaten here for 3 days and loved everything they even have a greenhouse in the back where they grow sprouts and wheatgrass thanks so much for helping me have the perfect holiday chef sarah
  it was the best smoked meat ever
  my second time was even better than the first this time i got the chicken and waffles omg it was glorious love love this place
  my wife and i love the nachos they are not your typical nacho plate great appetizer for 2 3 people
  took a half hour to get my first drink and an hour to get my 2nd drink the waitress was no where to be found and when she did finally appear i had to ask her where my drink was she forgot it food was okay
  this review is for their lunch one of the best values hidden in old town scottsdale i had their sashimi plater for 8 you got 9 pieces of fresh sashimi rice and salad i have also tried their kautsu lunch and that is a steal as well
  this place has ruined me for any other pizza it was amazing will stop everytime i m in vegas
  i can say that the sushi is actually pleasant the atmosphere is quaint not over the top but cute my wife and i ordered 5 sushi rolls california spicy tuna spicy crab and salmon tempura i didn t care for spicy crab because they mix the crab meat with mayo but my wife likes it that way cali and tuna rolls were good my fav was the salmon tempura rolls that was awesome they fry the salmon in tempura batter and then roll it really good for an appetizer we got soft shell crab it was a pretty large size crab and is enough for two people as an appetizer however the batter used wasn t your typical tempura it was a thicker kind of batter like the kind used on fried shrimp tempura is much lighter and fluffier while this batter was hard and extra crispy i didn t care for the batter at all but the crab itself was very meaty not sure where they get their soft shell crabs but they were pretty meaty for our entree we got the teriyaki beef bowl with rice and vegetables that was good i asked for the teriyaki sauce on the side because you just never know what a restaurant will do with that sauce they may end up using too much to where it becomes over powering so having it on the side was a smart choice it was very good vegetables were crispy and rice was well cooked and fluffy the service was very good very kind girls working there we were there on a thursday night st paddy s day 2011 and it wasn t that busy the sushi was brought out within 3 4 minutes way before the appetizer however in all fairness i should have known better no matter where you go if you do not request the appetizers brought out before the sushi then your sushi will often arrive beforehand this is because sushi is made very quickly whereas appetizers take some time especially soft shell crab because it needs to be fried i had a good laugh when the sushi came out first and our waitress said she could take it back and wait until the appetizers were done but my wife said no it was funny though no big deal prices are normal and in some cases good compared to other places their 50 off menu contains most of the normal sushi rolls most people likely order california spicy tuna etc if you just like sushi rolls then seriously do not order anything else most of the rolls come in 8 pieces averaging 4 per roll most women can probably tuck away 2 3 rolls while men can put away 4 5 rolls so for women you ll spend between 8 12 while men will spend between 16 20 you can also call ahead and pick it up these prices are as i said normal but can also be considered cheap as compared to some of the more higher end sushi places total we spent 45 00 which isn t bad at all considering there were two of us we got sushi rolls an entree plus appetizer and we got full the food is good give it a try it makes a great place to eat at before heading over to aliante casino to see a movie not to mention their prices are about the same as getting popcorn candy and soda at the movies how scary is that so skip the popcorn and get sushi instead it s better for you anyway and lord knows our country needs to lose weight final note the reviewer before me commented on the take out order being more important to the restaurant than the customers nearly 95 of the restaurants out there do the same thing i worked in the restaurant industry for a long time at many different places and we always catered to take out orders first that had large tickets that s just the way it is get used to it a 600 order is always going to take precedence it may be wrong to do but that s often what happens i feel bad for those people because they re right it s not fair but at the same time it could have happened to them at any restaurant because this kind of thing does happen at many restaurants all the time
  first off this place was good now there is a new owner chef and it is even better curries and soups and are amazing the best and most flavorful better than lotus for the usual suspects place is the best in town for regular thai food as in you won t find anything here you never heard of biggest complaint no more stuffed chicken wing and why is there no crispy rice salad anyways i eat here at least one time a week
  perfect breakfast impeccable service my wife and i stopped in for breakfast today for our first visit she ordered the granola raspberry pancake and i had a create your own omelette both were totally awesome cooked to perfection the waitresses were very friendly and walked us through all their specials and answered all our questions my omelette was light and fluffy like i prefer them and the cheese was melted to perfection my wife s pancake was an absolute taste sensation the restraunt was very clean well decorated and we got our food right away even though they were extremely busy i found the owner at the counter and advised her how impressed and pleased we were with our breakfast selections and told her to pass on our sincere appreciation to the chef and that we would definitely be back to sample the rest of their menu can t wait to try their lunch menu
  food was decent service was terrible the food was alright nothing too special i have had pizza and salad and appetizers from here nothing has been mind blowing where i have a problem was our server she was terrible she gave attitude when i ordered a water only i had my kid with me this means i will tip you extra because kids are a hassle she got 8 for a tip she took 22 minutes from the time she gave us menus to the time she got our order 22 minutes i asked if they put raw egg in the caesar dressing she said well of course they put raw egg in it it isn t well of course i asked because it wasn t obvious i then ordered an appetizer for my meal because i didn t want to wait another 20 minutes for her to return my meal was fine everyone else s meal was fine the server asked me if i wanted to try a different drink besides water when i m more than halfway through my meal probably not she was rude and hopefully i don t get her again yes i do remember her name but i don t want to put it on here my meal was 11 plus tax so i gave her a dollar normally i would have given her at least 3 50 since my kid was there but she didnt deserve the dollar i gave her
  today was my very first visit on friday after thanksgiving at 11 40am the place was full like a weekend i thought the hagow and shrimp and scallop dumplings had very thick skins so i discarded them and just ate the fillings there were no sui mai for an hour and just the same 2 carts going around and around the sui mai were okay but lacked shrimp and tasted a bit bland finally some ham shui gok s fried footballs stuffed with meat came along with some sesame balls we ordered the fried footballs and they were stone cold i told the cart lady and she just shrugged her shoulders like saying what could she do finally some panfried turnip cake came around and it was also cold the trays of baked goodies came around often and they all looked very good but we are more fans of the savory rather than sweet so we felt that the variety was lacking in that department we never saw any bean curd meat rolls or stuffed peppers in black bean sauce either i would give this place another try but right now i feel the china king had better tasting dim sum plus you can order the fried footballs and turnip cake off the menu and know it will be hot upon arrival the service staff were also rushing around past our table and that was a bit distracting maybe they were not expecting such a large crowd for a friday
  beautiful interior high quality dishes and great service definitely a place to take your girlfriend if you want to wow her dont forget to enjoy the amazing view of the strip
  while its not lotus it was tasty an the women were nice the cook was singing so i m sure food was made with love
  popped into what used to be blunt a couple of weeks ago for a cuppa and a bite to eat in the evening service was considerate swift and pot of tea for two was a very good size the potato wedges were well cooked and served with more than one dip so that was a pleasant touch the tuna salad was well presented and filling so all in all a decent dining experience that didn t cost the earth
  pcg is an excellent place to relax for brunch you will find courteous staff excellent table service and good food the environment was very laid back and relaxing definitely worth checking out if your in the area
  by far my new favorite restaraunt heard tons about it so finally my gf and i tried it about a month ago and we have been back 2 more times since then we get a bottle of champagne 2 orders of the steak frites and 2 sides dishes macaroni and spinach and for about 100 bucks not bad at all for the quality of what you get highly recommend
  best pizza in c u the thick it s not chicago style pan is amazing and unlike anything i ve ever had anywhere else i ve been going there 30 years and it s always been great get it to go service is slowwwww
  i see you darren w i get your point but i think you have missed the point of brookline pub this review is going to break it down for you things you go to brookline pub for cheap beer free pool on sundays 30 cent wings on monday and thursday karaoke on thursday nights a smoke filled room of blue collar dudes things you don t go to brookline pub for a good meal anything cooked to perfection a check that actually reflects what you consumed good smelling clothes after leaving a door on the bathroom a door on the bathroom stall i love the brookline pub for what it is a smokey bar filled with people who want to drink and hang out the bar tenders are nice missy is my girl their craft brews are under 4 and they have cheap bar food yeah it s not that great but it s brookline and it s a dirty pub that i happen to love
  yummy i had the basil rolls and cashew chicken medium and both were very delicious the vegetables were very fresh and the sauce was very tasty but not heavy i left feeling full but not too full the service was also fantastic and attentive i moved a block away and will definitely be back soon i would have given it 5 stars but didn t think the menu was as extensive as i would have liked
  they have the best crispy tofu large pieces cooked perfectly delicious vegetable soup and perfect udon noodles staff very friendly and helpful small but accommodating dining area
  we were in vegas for the weekend for my friend s wedding our last night there we were looking for a great seafood place to eat at i found seablue through google sorry yelp and this place was fantastic we ordered fresh oysters seafood paella strip steak with a 1 2 lobster and 2 glasses of prosecco i think the bill came out to 220 ish service was stellar the food was amazing i will definitly check out michael mina s other restaurants
  ordered a large pizza 12 wings and cannoli on monday with the coupon featured on yelp 25 off the food was very good and what a bargain the pizza had great flavor plenty of cheese and savory toppings i live a block away so i will definitely be back soon to try more items
  i took my kids there today for first time and my daughter s grilled cheese sendwich had mold i even took a picture no matter how tasty restaurant is it can t get forgiveness if they serve spoiled food by the way it is 105 outside and their kitchen door to outside is open
  my wife and i ate here this evening for our 15th anniversary the interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations the menu had also changed with some items doubling in price a coworker of my wife had given her a 25 gift card for christmas we ordered sweet teas and a bloomin onion the onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning my wife had the chicken tenders and i had the pork tenderloin it wa a good but wasn t outstanding at one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table he didn t introduce himself he asked about our meal and disappeared i told the waiter about him we were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the french toast bread pudding looked delicious
  lineup always moves very fast if there is one amazing food huge portions good prices the coffee is good the eggs are always amazing unlike a lot of places and the service is incredible once you are seated your coffee mug will not go dry
  i have never been treated so rudely and unprofessionally i changed my drink order twice and you would have thought i killed some one alexis the server told me after i told her that i didn t want the iced matcha green tea that the item would not be removed from my bill i told her the drink tasted horrible like matcha mix and tap water and i did not want to drink it because it did not taste good she was extremely rude and i asked to talk to a manager as a former food server i know that removing an item from the bill is no biggie i saw the manager coming over to our table and i thought the problem would be rectified the manager was rude and confrontational instead of fixing the problem he actually made things worse but eventually decided to take the 4 00 item off of our bill the excitement my husband son and i initially felt walking into the place subsided after all of this hoopla over a drink we felt unwanted negative vibes the entire time we were there despite all of this we decided to stay like dummies and try the food while we were eating alexis threw the check on the table she did not bother to ask us what we thought about the food or whether or not we wanted refills on drinks or dessert i know as a server you never bring the bill over until you see that your patrons are done eating she obviously did not get this memo i seriously would not recommend this establishment and not because the food isn t good a place of business should treat anyone who walks through the doors like family the service provided by the server alexis and the douche manager was absolutely horrendous i will not be returning and i will tell everyone i know not to go also service sucks
  awesome southern comfort food done with impeccable style and service i visited with my 3 sisters and we all could not believe how good everything was the brined fried chicken with watermelon and waffle came with maple syrup and a hot red sauce just the right blend of sweet and savory grilled romaine crispy and charred and perfect florida heirloom tomatoes with citrus vinaigrette perfect desserts were a giant piece of bourbon layer cake with cream cheese bacon frosting and chocolate chess pie it was worth the food coma
  what a surprise i have driven by capo s over a thousand times and finally on a whim decided to try it out the ambiance and food were out of this world we sat off the main dining room but still could enjoy the action in the other room service was fantastic and the food the best the meatballs were huge and melted in my mouth the garlic salad dressing was perfect not too much garlic but enough to fend off those vampires that might be lurking in vegas at night we will be back
  oh my goodness the pilgrim is the best savory thing i have ever eaten in a pastry crust it was thanksgiving perfectly executed and tucked into a flakey not at all soggy pillow of heaven served with gravy and cranberry sauce if youre doing it right you slather both all over your pastry to get a bit in every bite i want to try every pasty and cant wait to go back
  friendly staff good beer and a great chicken sandwich laid back atmosphere awesome trivia on saturdays
  quick update they no longer serve the mac cheese its a terrible tragedy
  pizza was really good super thin and greasy but i feel it was a bit overpriced out the door 2 toppings was 16 change for a medium probably won t go back
  first night in vegas after a very long flight not really the flight but the delays in san jose i arrived in las vegas about 90 minutes later than i had expected i had already made reservations at nine fine irishmen but i had to constantly push it back due to the delays finally got to the hotel and just threw my bags on the floor didn t even change or wash up or anything because i was absolutely famished my girlfriend and i walked over to ny ny and were greeted by one of the hosts there and asked us if we wanted to sit downstairs or upstairs i asked which is louder and he offered to take us in and we could have our pick which was great we decided to sit up stairs overlooking the stage where a band was playing a lot of irish fare the decor and the audacity of the place is awesome it s like ireland threw up from across the pond and it all landed in this restaurant i loved it from the minute we walked in now on to dinner we started dinner off with the drunken onion rings now i ve had my fair share of onion rings in the past and i would have to say that these fat behemoths take the cake hands down they were huge but they were cooked to perfection the batter was amazing and the onions on the inside were cooked perfectly now onto the entrees for the evening my girlfriend decided on the pan roasted red snapper which looked out of sight and i m sure was very tasty since there wasn t any left for me to even try haha and i had the pork porterhouse which when it came out i was actually in shock it was huge and it tasted incredible especially with the apple and peach chutney side dishes which i wish would have come with the meal instead of having to dish out another 5 each were great never the less i ordered the colcannon mashed potatoes which we both enjoyed immensely and my girlfriend ordered the whipped sweet potatoes which were awesome too all in all i d have to say that this restaurant will most definitely be visited again the next time we are in vegas
  second time i ve eaten here made reservations for 6 people and we showed with only three and they said no problem after they sat us 2 of our missing 3 showed up and the staff immediately got a second table pulled over and seated the other i thought was awesome we all placed our orders and 4 out the five of us got the bone in ribeye and we all said it was one of the best steaks we have had ever sides where all very good also grits smashed potatoes baked potato was huge the staff was great and was a very well oiled machine dominic was our head waiter and he was great we will back this summer for another stop
  huge their pizza is so huge it won t even fit in the biggest box they have a lot of the time this is a problem making up for awful tasting pizza not the case here fantastic i ve had pizza from here a few times as my sister lives relatively close and when i go visit i try to talk them in to pizza from here it s an interesting place and very authentic the prices are very reasonable i ve not tried anything but pizza but i freaking love pizza and i love their pizza here note i always just get cheese pizza because the kids like it more but it s great
  great prices and great food here i love it every time and open 24 hours
  no doubt best sushi in town jackie rocks
  i recommended this place to our friends and i was so embarrassed 2 of us in our party ordered prime rib medium rare one of us had an end cut and when we mentioned it we were told it would be another hour before more prime rib would be ready all of our dinners were stone cold and the manager said he could take it all back and fix it from where i was sitting i could see the kitchen and all of our plates were headed for the microwave oven we motioned for our server and told him we did not want out steaks and lobster tails heated in the microwave he apologized we left and we will never ever go here again the manager was totally unprofessional and clueless in solving this situation
  no
  great place to stop in for lunch we had miso soup complementary edamame free from the check in in offer the lunch special with cali and crunch roll 10 we left stuffed for 11 bucks well plus a tip so more than 11 but hey that is awesome the miso soup is very good the edamame is salted right and cooked right and the cali and crunch rolls are very very good our waiter was good too small complaint seems like the place needs a little detailing the vents are dusty tables sticky walls smudged clean overall but needs a little tune up
  i m am being overly critical in my review of bentley s on 27th and were it not for how the evening ended i would be giving them a solid 4 star rating however let me not get ahead of myself firstly the view it s beautiful and it s clearly a major reason for choosing this restaurant so the setting and ambience do not disappoint starters were superb blackened tiger prawns and luxury mac n cheese main course was good dover soul and the seafood speciality although the latter was overly rich and could have been a little more balanced the cheesecake dessert was however a letdown and it took forever to make its way to our table suffice to say that the best thing on the plate was the fresh fruit bentley s on 27 is knocking on the door of 4 stars but just missed the mark
  food is good and well presented service is professional and quick
  i m in a bowling league at arsenal lanes and my team was meeting here every week for happy hour before we roll we tried to dine here three different times and every time our bills were messed up food was forgotten and took forever and when we were finally fed it was cold or bland they have really nice specials but i would have rather paid full price to have things done right the bar tenders were forgetful and not attentive at all and they weren t even busy i really want to like industry but it just hasn t proven itself to me i ll probably give it another shot at some point but it s not going to be any time soon for now we ve taken our pre bowling business to new amsterdam and have been quite happy
  excellent authentic chicago stuffed pizza i used to have it shipped to me from gino s east in chicago but now i eat here we love this pizza
  i eat at pei wei frequently and have always been happy until tonight i ordered the low mein and it was awful unfortunately i got it to go so i was stuck eating something that was not good at all so disappointed may be a while before i venture back
  great place enjoyed the food drinks music and ambiance
  after researching numerous articles on the best burgers in phoenix it was noticed that delux burger was on every one of those lists i myself have been dying to try it for some time now and my bf happened to be having a burger craving last night after some convincing we went to delux and for a small place was so happy to be seated right away because it was 8pm and we were hungry the ambiance of the place is bar and lounge which to me was nice especially for a friday night however my bf wasn t initially pleased because of the dim lighting and the fact that he wouldn t be able to see his food let s just say that didn t matter anymore because his first words after his first bite of the delux burger was burger craving fulfilled and after trying it myself i was impressed definitely one of the best burgers i ve tried i got the veggie burger which was good but i wish i had ordered the delux burger as well we also got an order of mixed fries regular sweet potato a la carte literally in a super cute tiny shopping cart and was very pleased my bf who also was not a sweet potato fan just became one because theirs were that good and the aioli sauce it came with helped a ton our server was more than attentive and we even got a visit and chat from who i believe was the owner which was very nice we were curious to try the sushi that they recently started serving there which the owner explained stems from his other restaurant zen 32 but we will save that for next time because we will definitely be back
  i had the bbq cheddar burger and it was amazing i asked for extra bbq sauce and they brought out warn bbq sauce shoutout to our server hiromi she was amazing
  this place is disgusting they allow drunk people on their porch to harass customers but then if the customer complains they are cut off sorry but that is messed up i ll go get crappy bar food from places that at least support females not be harassed if you re a girl wearing a dress don t go here because people are allowed to say rude and inappropriate things to you worst place ever
  lo lo s tickles me pink i love everything about the place the atmosphere and theme is awesome and unapologetic about it for fuck s sake there s an old fashioned looking sign that says kool aid always on tap it s amazing service was slower than i d hoped and i never did get my beer but everyone was very nice the food was good and worth the price it felt like home cooking it was hand food and i liked that next time i go i plan on coming in there with room to eat a lot because it was tops
  the location is quick and friendly but let s face it it s taco bell
  a buddy and i were out for a wild night on the town now that i m a mom any time i m out past 8pm constitutes a wild night and ended up here for a pre drinks dinner it seems to be the only moderately priced restaurant in red rock one that isn t fast food but isn t 30 for entrees i had the sampler plate of sliders and a plate of onion rings buddy had the smokehouse burger and fries ok so i know sliders are supposed to be small but these sliders were miniscule i could finish one in about two medium sized bites seriously if i really tried i could ve maybe fit an entire one in my mouth and no matter what others may say my mouth is not that big p so i had to pace myself and take tiny bites because i didn t want to be done before my friend was even a quarter of the way through her burger taste sampler plate of sliders c beef best of the three a good combination of patty sauce and grilled onion turkey normally i love turkey burgers this one was just meh the meat was overcooked and too dry so it was hard to taste anything else ahi tuna interesting to taste it in a burger form the big bun outweighed delicate tuna could barely taste the tuna onion rings b perfectly crisp just a tiny bit greasy portion was huge compared to the sliders smokehouse burger a friend loved it finished the entire thing might be the most i ve seen her eat ever fries b her burger came with fries which i had the pleasure of stealing good fries but not particularly memorable service c even though the restaurant was practically empty everything took a really long time our waiter seemed distracted and was not very attentive if i ever go back i ll order a proper burger and try the warm pretzel sticks who can resist pretzel dipped in cheese
  regular breakfast at 6 99 with card is fine excellent omelet cook some cool extras like miso soup chicken fried steak donut holes serves a hawaiian crowd since connected to the cal take the bridge and there is a lappert s ice cream shop everything on the buffet looks fresh even the sliced tomatoes only issue was weak coffee and slow on refills nice bright room too
  i enjoyed a local brew and fantastic fish ceviche followed by shrimp and chicken taco the food was fresh and well presented the bar staff was very friendly and engaging and gave me advice on the best bar to watch a football game the decor speaks hawaiian complemented by text mex flavours on the menu the outdoor dining area is large and open to the bar i liked it and would definitely go back
  i love coming to new cities and finding small hidden gems like the alo cafe super cute atmosphere surrounded by greenery it makes you feel like you re on the california coast most the seating is outside in the shade the staff was really friendly and the breakfast was delicious i ordered the corn beef hash with eggs not too spicy i m a wimp when it comes to spice and the perfect amount of food my friend had the omelette and loved it definitely add this to your breakfast list for the atmosphere alone it makes it a unique experience go for the food too
  tuesdays are the best obvs thanks to their special not really a dinner place but great place to hang out and have a variety of wine selections
  the best pretzel bread sticks ever soft with that salty crust delicious steak sliders too
  they ve got some bomb ass chile relleno here everytime i go in i tell myself ok let s try something new this time but always seem to end up with a steaming hot plate of chile relleno i don t know what they re doing different here but this one stands out the green chili is bomb too i d put that h t on my cheerios
  i must say that jean philippe patisserie has many dessert selection to choose from so many that i cannot decide which one i want from crepe to gelato to cakes to coffee ahhh i want them all i ended up treating myself to a caramel twist it has a strong coffee flavor which i like the caramel was there but it didn t overpower the coffee flavor nor was it too sweet thinking my cup of coffee would be enough i was wrong i just had to order a dessert i ended up getting the triple chocolate flourless cake it was okay waaayyy too sweet it for sure satisfied my sweet tooth i wished i had order their crepe cuz it looked really good yes it is expensive but sometimes u just need to treat yourself to something good after a long week of hard work
  my wife and i went to check full house bbq and we were not disappointed the place is very clean and well organized the service is very friendly we ordered surf and turf and kare kare never knowing what to expect to my surprise i ate it all that s how good it was the chef came out and introduced himself and found out he was a chef at mandalay bay hotel that explains the flavourful food and the excellent presentation of our food my wife had to order more to go and ordered the siopao and palabok excellent choice i was told that the boddle boat is good but it is serve for 4 people we will try it next time i need to try some more in the menu to give it a 5 but our overall experience is great with very reasonable price
  this is a great place to have a good cup of joe in the morning a lot of places around offer pretty much the same omelets sandwiches etc pancakes breakfast in a hurry and with poor service but finding a place with good coffee good food and attentive service all in one is not always easy this place has it we go very often and the place is nice and small but we always feel welcome their pancakes are delicious is not a fast food place so don t expect the waiters to be all over you they give you space and since the place is always packed try a sunday at 9am be prepared to have a nice no hurries breakfast
  there s no shortage of pricey delicious restaurants by big name chefs in the vegas so what makes bouchon so special your partners in dining are there on purpose it s not right off the strip like many of its restaurant peers at those places you could be dining near people who are a fan of the food people who just happen to walk by or people carrying an oh so classy yard glass not bouchon you have to work to get to bouchon it s deep in the venetian but it s worth every wrong turn you might make on your way there if it s not horribly muggy sit outside by the garden pool the ambiance is a 10 also the service the best i ve ever had in the history of ever and do yourself a favor and don t bother getting the pommes frites sans truffles upgrade and you won t be disappointed
  yum great big group experience walked in not hungry and once the chef started chopping up the goodness right and front of me i ended up ordering great times thanks kyoto
  great late night food sandwiches and fries are on point i would like to think that this is the best spot in pittsburg unhealthy eating
  great place good pizza that tastes great and is very authentic we had a mushroom and sausage and we were very impressed you won t be disappointed
  this is probably one of the better buffets vegas has to offer we went for brunch and beat the long lines the choices are much more exotic such as the eggs benedict gnocci duck legs etc they have a good salad bar yogurt and granola breads and spread etc the dessert section had ice cream little cakes panna cotta a lovely passion fruit cake croissanta donuts chocolate covered strawberries and more while buffets aren t the highest quality of food wicked spoon does a good job of keeping things fresh and interesting
  i have been here many times and love the food unfortunately last time i went to sit down and eat they totally ignored my daughter and i they looked at me several times and my daughter several times but nobody ever came to help us they helped other tables and even went to folding pizza boxes i m amazed that that even happened since that incident i have not gone back maybe i will eventually
  not bad huge portions so plenty to share for a chain restaurant i was pretty impressed i would recommend going here if you are in vegas as most of the restaurants are pretty iffy when it comes to quality
  definitely not worth going to unless you have the groupon or some sort of crazy deal i used the 75 groupon that covered a starter 2 salads soups 2 entrees a side to share and 2 desserts asked for a medium cooked filet mignon and very clearly was given rare seared mediocre steak and quality would not go again and that showed seating for at least 250 and there was about 15 people on a saturday at 7pm
  this is probably the best ny style pizza i ve had outside of the east coast my boyfriend s family of 10 came over and the only sensible option for a party that large is pizza and this place is right down the street we ordered it for delivery and it came promptly in 30 minutes like they said greasy cheesy and it had a fluffy crust highly recommended i will check out the actual restaurant next time i have a pizza craving
  i ditch class more than i should probably admit on this public forum and the last time i found myself walking away from my night class my best friend and i decided food was in order my best friend samantha b does not have a yelp she should in fact i would like to dedicate my current elite status to her because she knows every great restaurant all over the city i often accompany her to these food havens because i sugar momma her with rides to asu west samantha b introduced me to market bistro on the fateful day that we ditched night class and i have been craving it ever since we got a salad and mac and cheese the create your own is fabulous ten items for 7 99 parmesan chips grapes mixed springs corn walnuts olives and five other things i can t remember made up our salad which was big enough to split i questioned her judgment on the corn i really did i now see the error in my ways of the dressing choices we got ranch now i don t even like ranch but guess what you re going to like it and i did too on this salad anyways the mac wasn t as good as the salad but it was alright i wish it was fresh and came in larger portions next time i ditch class i know to go to market and get corn in my salad my cravings are telling me to ditch class soon
  my goodness greasy burn yo finger chicken these are the kinds of places i miss from la over there the food was proper and the hospitality is abundant it s been a long time but frankly my broken ass self can t add hypertension to the list of issues so it s a real treat to get some southern comfort i m with everyone that the cornbread pancakes are love i ve had these once as a cornbread pigs in a blanket in a southern mommas home these were better it s nothing crazy creative but it s simple goodness comfort at it s finest i had a white meat fried chicken plate with red beans and rice and collard greens the chicken was juicy and i think the seasoning was good slightly more salty than i normally like but i m not big on salt once i dipped in a side of gravy and hot sauce though it was all good muddy water to wash it down was perfect red beans and rice is basic and decent collard greens were decent bf got the chicken and waffles the waffles were interesting since they were shaped like a hot dog bun and the batter was a cinnamon batter we thought the waffle was good alone but that the sweet waffle got a bit too much after a while i prefer plain waffles with chicken i want to get these waffles for breakfast though we brought the bf s mom and grandma and they had a chicken plate and meatloaf both were very happy with it and it got the approval that they said there will be a next time the bf would like to say that he feels this is the best chicken he s had and that he wants the 5 star bump both his mom and he would like to add that neither are fried chicken people but enjoyed it enough that they d both want the chicken again i m saying this is good solid fare but it s not the absolute best mississippi cooking i ve had but i d have to fly out to go get to my favorite food spot though i felt the food after but that isn t their fault my busted self indulged in fatty chicken and salts worth it though drinking plenty of water to flush it out 4 stars for the food with me the 5 star bump is definitely because of the staff we walked in and the owner greeted us enthusiastically our server was sweet and our service was attentive our server even offered to pull me up a to go muddy water since everyone was finished with foods but i was still thirsty and took just a gulp to finish it off when our plates came except the bf s the owner noticed and went up to the window to check up on the kitchen and promptly brought out his order gotta appreciate an owner who has a hand in the smooth operation and speaking of the line it s crazy how they kick it old school without any tickets and call out the order the kitchen doesn t mess up orders much either food never sits longer than a few seconds on the pass so food is hot and fresh for everyone sure it takes a while to get some foods but it was busy and everything is fried up fresh i d be worried if it didn t take a moment to make since everything should be fresh i think we re so used to fast foods that most people might think it s a long wait won t slap our mommas but we ll bring em back
  we went for valentines day and they were very busy and trying to make sure everyone was happy for a very busy night service was pretty good the food is what matters most and it was good too we had the buffet the best was the chicken tikki masala and lamb vindaloo in addition to the pakoras there was some other chicken dish that was good but i forget the name i hadn t heard of it before it was in more of a broth vs a creamy sauce there were some vegetarian options but not tons samosas and naan weren t the best i ve had but not bad i d like to go again
  went to little shanghai last night wednesday with a friend we were in no hurry had a lot of personal stories to catch up on so the slow service didn t bother us they were busy and i think there were only four people working dad in the kitchen mom taking orders and two boys who didn t speak much english delivering food and cleaning we shared some pot stickers that were excellent and a spicy sauce with fresh scallions tommy had the lemon chicken breaded boneless skinless breast in a tart and tangy lemon sauce i talked to mom and asked for suggestions and wound up with crispy noodles with three turned out to be shrimp beef and pork plus some lobster bits and pea pods broccoli oyster mushrooms water chestnuts bean sprouts carrots celery onions if i said mirepoix would that be snooty anyway the dish was delicious we spent a casual 2 hours with great food in a comfy place for twenty bucks apiece including wine and beers the food was fresh and properly prepared a good chinese restaurant catering to arcadia honkies
  third trip here and the nw pub burger is the best the staff has been great every time also a must try are the bacon cheddar potato pancakes nice atmosphere inside and out
  this place was awesome their food had alot of flavor and our waiter needed a little personality check overall would love to come back again for more
  bueno cheef gordon soy un admirador tuyo quizas porque soy emotional coach y la parte de coaching del programa me engancha sin dura la calidad de los productos es buena solamente buena que conste nada espectacular ni extraordinario eso si correcta con el precio el lugar me gusta aunque la particularidad de este casino son estos espacios tan especiales y su distribu ion en general si te estas preguntando si volvere sin duda si no obstante para impresionar tengo otros rtes mejores aprovado ahora ve come y cuentanos que tal te ha ido
  there isn t a bad thing to say about this place the place was packed and the wait was only 30 minutes which is great and the service was fantastic we shared the andy s sage fried chicken and still couldn t finish it the portions are huge and price is fantastic it s a must try i will be back
  very poor service waited 20 minutes for a juice not pleased at all lady taking my order was short and seemed annoyed
  my family goes out for breakfast every weekend we re always searching for the perfect spot unpretentious with a breakfast to rock your socks off when i saw the pictures on yelp with the homey decor and plates piled high with scrumptious looking breakfast staples i knew we d found a winner i was surprised there was no wait on a sunday morning we were seated and drink orders taken right away we all enjoyed our breakfast thoroughly portions were huge and prices very affordable we ordered the kids french toast for my son and the kitchen accidentally made the adult portion our waitress noticed right away and only charged us the kid s price for about 30 we had breakfast for three adults and one child with leftovers to boot and before i forget the breakfast potatoes were amazeballs i consider myself a connoisseur of breakfast potatoes and these were seriously the best i ve ever had crispy on the outside soft on the inside and seasoned perfectly awesome
  i went to china poblano with my family at 10 00 pm on a saturday night we were seated promptly our waiter was terrible he didn t explain the menu and was not helpful at all most of the plates can be shared but we didn t know how to go about ordering we all agreed that the experience could have been a lot better had we had a waiter who was helpful happy to explain the menu and had a personality if i would have caught his name i would have definitely called management the food was so so definitely not worth the prices
  we found this place on yelp it s a little tucked away and not on our normal route so we re lucky to have found this little gem the menu is great lots of options and some interesting dishes the food was outstanding as was the service we ll definitely be back
  i love the food here reasonable prices and they even deliver highly recommend this place humus is amazing here too
  since the change of ownership the food is only ok so it wasn t ever on my go to list for pho but after a long day and returning from a biz trip this is the closest pho joint to my home the owner i assume based on previous experience sat me down w a menu and there i sat sat sat and finally the owner goes out w a buddy to drink a beer and has to walk by me as i continued to sit first table by the entrance at the 10min mark i gave up and returned the menu to the bar area as i walked outside the owner was like are you done already obviously not you sat me 10 min ago so i found that question pretty condescending i told him i didn t receive any service after 10 min and to his credit he apologized so 2 stars for the ho hum food 1 star overall for poor service erasing knowledge of the existance of this restaurant fail original 10 28 2010 4 star i come here occasionally which means the food is tasty enough my personal consensus is the pricing is higher than what i d generally pay to get a no soup vermicelli fix their bowls are huge yum 20 this place is good for taking newbies the atmosphere and decor is modern and inviting and folks who are judgemental about divey looking joints
  this is the place for a great burger period although the bone marrow with caramelized onions and pork shoulder are pretty damn good too so with great service and wonderful ambiance i really liked this restaurant and look forward to returning
  their pancakes are so good they re practically a dessert themselves sometimes the service can get backed up when they re really busy but the staff is always very nice the outdoor seating is really nice during the cooler months and the booths are nice a long for big parties all around great breakfast place
  very friendly and especially affordable place great for students everything seems deep fried can t complain we re visiting today again
  as other reviewers have said this is a nice place to get a beer and chat with friends it s relatively quiet compared to other places and they do keep trivial pursuit cards around at the bar which can add a little fun into the mix if you re the trivia type i struggle a little bit with the gastropub classification on this one unless you call any bar grille establishment a gastropub i ve never had food here that i was particularly fond of nor would i consider it one of their selling points it s merely ok overall the map room serves a different clientele and provides a niche atmosphere unlike the other establishments in the square which is why is still exists
  all i can say is wow easily some of the best italian food i ve had you certainly get what you pay for the portions are no joke if you are in the mood for a classy delicious italian dinner this is the place to go
  this place has the best breakfast food and you don t have to wait if you call ahead to put your name in it isn t too expensive either
  this place is amazing wish they delivered prices are very reasonable and the food is fresh and delicious
  my wife and i love this place best lobster sandwich we ever had we ordered the connecticut and lobster was huge and very fresh we got the combo with lemonade and chowder fries which were also pretty good would definitely come back and try other flavours
  if you feel like korean food and you happen to be in the area then this place is just ok i had the stone pot bibimbob with the spicy tofu soup the bibimbob was ok but the portions of meat and vegetables was so small that i had to put in alot of sauce cuz there was so much rice it tasted so bland the poke was good and one thing i was curious about was meat chun never saw it before and would like the try it next time if i was ever in the area again this is the first korean place i went to that didn t have alcohol
  we worked on the 4th of july and weren t able to go to any celebrations came home and fell asleep until 9 30 pm and woke up hungry decided that we at least had to have bbq in honor of the day famous daves is nearby and we decided to try them out and see why they are so famous after trying their all american platter 50 we are still wondering
  stopped in for lunch and the open air high doors are great in the high 70 s temps of march
  i am very happy that i have found some decent non chain restaurants up in north scottsdale jj s is a great deli i ordered the tuna sandwich and got a side of cucumber salad my coworker got the dave s bagelwich my sandwich was delicious my only disappointment was the size of the side 3 bites and it was gone would probably be 2 for males coworker loved her bagel sandwich i do wish they had half sours but oh well i will be back for sure
  ok i ve been to someburro s a thousand times and i like it i really do however the problem that 990 out of those thousand times i ve had the pollo fundido simply one of the best fast guilty pleasures that you can experience however after eating it i feel like i ve just dug another inch closer to the grave or shaved another couple of days off of my life as i age i m trying to eat healthier so here i am at someburro s trying to find something healthy that doesn t give me visions of the grim reaper and that gives me the near orgasmic feeling that i have when down the pollo fundido so far i haven t found anything else on the menu that fits the bill i ve tried the veggie burro which is probably the healthiest thing on the menu and it s eh ok the avocado in it is great and i haven t seen them put less than fresh avocado slices in it i once tried the taco salad which was way less than satisfying and actually kind of gross i mean you take some actually healthy stuff and surround it in a bowl of fried whatever i m also not big into shredded beef or the machaca the chicken quality is ok but has a good portion of dark meat in it it s good because it s marinated so heavily though i d imagine that the marinade does not add to the health quotient on the bright side this place is decent for kids there are inexpensive options for little ones we get the quesadilla s for the boys who pretty much just pick over the quesadilla waiting for the go ahead from mom to dive into the churros by the way the churros are no bueno in my opinion the kids like em cause they are doused in sugar but they aren t doughy they are crunchy crispy and fried fried fried i feel pangs of guilt as if i m poisoning my children when they eat those some of you reading this are probably thinking if he s trying to be healthy perhaps he shouldn t be going to someburro s in the first place and you re probably right
  i still had 12 on my gift gard so i stopped by and grabbed a burger on the way home since this week i had already tried all the bbq it was a tough choice but i went for the devil s spit bacon burger no suprise it was one of the best burgers i have ever eaten cooked to perfection medium well with a nice layer of bbq sauce cooked into it topped with a toasted bun cheese crispy bacon lettuce tomato and crunchy hell fire pickles i don t think i took 1 breath until this thing was gone i can t wait to go back for another maybe they need a drive thru what is the best chain restaurant burger you ve ever had red robin vs tgi fridays vs famous dave s i m gonna check more thoroughly
  about the best thing i can say about the food at yard house at the red rock casino is that they have a very good beer menu if you like bar food the yard house has an extensive menu of offerings but everything we recently tried was less than mediocre there are much better bar food restaurants out there our party of four shared two appetizers fried calamari which was the worse fried calamari i ve ever had overcooked and with absolutely no seasoning it was bland dry and disgusting lobster crab and artichoke dip with chips and pita which had an unusual flavor not quite crab dip and not quite artichoke and lost somewhere in the middle pretty bad one taste was enough for me for entrees we tried steak sandwich which had a very tough and flavorless cut of beef in a bun filled with fried straw onions awful turkey pot pie which had an undercooked pastry crust and served in a dish that seemed as big as a wagon wheel way too much food although it was filled with tasty chunks of turkey and veggies not bad not good but edible crunchy ahi salad which had decent quality ahi that was seared quite nicely this was the best dish we received fish and chips which were greasy and sort of bland edible but not a lot going for it service was good and again the beer was great the waiter removed the calamari from the bill after i told him it was tasteless we won t be back except maybe for a beer
  24 7 pho can t beat it there s always a lot of people hanging around outside but i haven t had a wait in the few times i ve been the egg rolls are awesome and the only soup i ve gotten was the rare steak which is better than a lot i ve had loud as hell but always a good time
  the wine is good but a little pricier than i think it should be the bruschetta is absolutely out of this world recommending the ricotta salmon prosciutto and pepper in that order too i d had the same server each time and he s great remembered the table we sat at the wines we ordered and even the bruschetta i was shocked the only reason i didn t give this place a 5 was due to the limited parking and the painful wait
  thank you restaurant week i have been looking at this place for months on open table i will say i was overjoyed i didn t realize this is a high end steakhouse comparable in my humble opinion to donovan s and the ilk the nice part was i felt the vibe inside a bit more hip and modern the service was flawless and the food was wonderful steaks cooked perfectly and melted like butter if you get a chance to go here especially for something like restaurant week where you can save some money and really taste the menu i highly recommend the arrowhead grill
  had a lunch combo and a grab and how sushi combo wasn t good but the grab and go was much better not bad for a quick lunch
  had a great meal and enjoyed our dining experience our waiter alex was fun engaging and enthusiastic we loved it and we ll be back with friends
  we went to dinner here last night it was amazing we ordered the chicken tikka marsala with rice and nann bread would definitely recommend this place when you first walk in the place looks dead because it s in an old mall type thing but the seating is around the corner and there were lots of people there
  i love the innovative bar program and the broccili rabe crostini
  this restaurant is not southern i was expecting some gumbo or jumbalaya and got some sort of mesh of favors that were hit and miss it is not so much a restaurant as it is a chemistry experiment the dishes here that are good are interesting combinations of favors i haven t had before because this restaurant seems to me just an experiment to test people s tolerance for someone s best idea for a crazy chem lab you ll have to go to try for yourself it isn t southern anything it is lunar
  yes there is now a white castle located on the strip in las vegas everyone who wants to try them without going to the midwest east coast can now have a taste of the well known slider i have enjoyed white castle before in chicago and found that they are quite tasty and i can put a few back my cousin always orders them with extra pickles i should have remembered that when eating them in vegas i forgot that tidbit but they were still really good i really wish they had a location in denver that would make my year the best 2 things about the one on the strip they are open 24 hours and they sell beer what can make this place better well it is also attached to a casino the place was hoping and cranking out burgers at a rapid rate if you haven t tried white castle now is your time
  i do love fat heads definitely one of my favorite spots on east carson service is always fast and friendly what a beer selection too i always get the bumbleberry which is a blueberry and honey beer which comes with fresh blueberries in the pint i hate to put bad news first or last so i ll throw it in the middle their steak has really been missing the mark lately i ve ordered it a few times each time medium rare all but once it came out medium well to well done instead i cut them a little slack since steak isn t their specialty but any good chef should know the difference between a warm red center and a hot colorless center but when the steak has come out to temp it s delicious typically aside from the few times i gave their steak a shot i get the same few things i start with a giant plate of fresh cut garlic fries accompanied by chicken fingers with a side of bbq sauce the nachos are definitely to die for as well their sandwiches ahem headwiches are massive and really impressive too overall i give fat heads an a and highly recommend it
  went there around 8pm last saturday night we should have taken the hint it wasn t going to be very good given the fact the place was almost empty service was extremely slow my husband and i each ordered a margarita i got hibiscus he got an original after waiting forever for the drinks to arrive the waiter proceeds to tell us they did not have a bartender my drink was fine but my husbands had a foul taste to it he told a waitress and she stated that he shouldn t have ordered it if he didn t like it after asking to speak to a manager he then tells my husband it s his problem and maybe he just isn t in the mood for a margarita they never offered to remake the drink or anything just said it was my husband they were very rude we cancelled our food order we ended up paying for my margarita which was left sitting on the table should have been complimentary the only food we tried were the chips salsa the chips tasted old the salsa was overpowered with cilantro will never waste our time here again
  walked in saw 2 3 people in line when we arrived figured shouldn t be too long walked out of there 15 minutes later with now 8 people waiting did not want to go there to begin with but my coworker did because of being on a budget so i bit the bullet and reluctantly went 3 of the 5 people that came in after us left well before we did will not return to this one i d give negative stars if i could
  haven t been here for a while love this place has a great menu of rolls you don t see other places the staff is super friendly the manager actually engaged in conversation with us the sushi chefs make great food
  this is wynn s crown jewel fresh and often hard to find seafood are the star here this is an expensive restaurant and the prices are high but sometimes you need to splurge and this place won t disappoint some notes they begin with a seafood cart with the fresh fish of the evening we elected to share the john dory quite honestly it was good but not worth the hype i have had much tastier fish the pasta dishes were fantastic and the risotto was up there with some of the best i have ever had we had some langoustines hardly any meat a big tease skip these service was very good and this was a very enjoyable night steve wynn even walked by with his wife on the way to his table and said hello
  we love this place always greeted with a smile and welcome great little family run restaurant we usually go on tuesday night when they have a good selection of half price or discounted items they also have a sunday all you can eat special the quality is always as good as the hospitality
  greasy cold food with far less exceptional service avoid if you can the renovation looks great so there was a positive
  great happy hour til 7 every day i always get the red sangria the happy hour food is ok but we prefer to split the goat cheese burger because it is juicy and sooo flavorful service here has always been good especially while sitting at the bar they have a dog patio here as well we brought our dog here and they treated her to a huge bone and some water she loved it
  this is the best buffet in vegas hands down its the quality that makes this the premiere buffet in las vegas but you will surely pay for it the roughly 35 00 you spend may or may not be worth the price however vegas has become way overpriced and if you want to have a full stomach this is the place to go i recommend going for a late lunch its a bit cheaper and still a nice buffet everyone runs for the crab legs but the highlight of the buffet is the prime rib and the mashed potatoes definitely the best mashed potatoes i have ever had i give the wynn buffet a 86 100 it seems wynn has lowered their standards a bit not worth the breakfast buffet but lunch or dinner is a good choice
  so i was debating on writing a review or not to this place because it use to be my favorite place to hang out every thursday night for over a year with my boyfriend we had great service from matt darrin buddy justin ray and all the other guys who use to work there they went above and beyond to make sure they served everyone and the drinks and food were great things started changing mainly with the staff and the changes were not good all those guys we would return to see were no longer there the feel of the place was not the same and also the service with the new people was horrible i have not returned to this place in about 3 months because it just was not the same not just the service but the food there are changes and i do not like the new nachos those are not nachos anyways i read some of these reviews down there and it seems that the place is not improving and it makes me feel like that i have no business going back i just hope that the owners realize that their changes has affected business and it is really upsetting
  great food great staff great feel when in vegas you should check this out and hang with the some local
  stopped by native tonight for a drink and their new waitress working the patio was so incredibly rude she carded us for a drink which we understand but being regulars we didn t think to bring them but instead of being polite about it she was full of attitude it just rubbed us the wrong way then she came back and asked if we wanted to order anything we said no she huffed and puffed and went and got another waitress to help us the rest of the night the manager might want to rethink this hire and we are pretty sure the lemons they use for water and ice tea were sprayed with perfume
  tried this place for the first time today after reading the yelp reviews on burgers and i think it was even better than i had expected the california burger was awesome and i loved the fries to top it all off i had a dublin dr pepper to was it down was the best burger shop hamburger i have had in years the have a soda shop also where you can pick out gourmet sodas with a really big selection service was fast and very friendly i will definitely be back again when i am in the area
  wow we never knew this little gem of a place was just a few miles from home loved the authentic food choices the staff were friendly and the food was very good i had the elote loco and taco locos and we ordered guacamole to share everything was really good and we will definitely come and visit sabor again
  this is probably where you will find me most weekends if i m in the area the food is excellent well priced and the service friendly
  here is the problem with havana cafe its overpriced i ordered a emparedado cubano sandwich as carry out i liked it it was tasty and came with french fries and moros black beans and rice concoction it was supposed to come with cabbage salad but that appeared to be missing in action when i opened the box it cost me 16 if i pay that much for a sandwich french fries and rice blackbeans they need to be amongst the most delicious things i ve tasted in order to justify that but they weren t they were just barely good if they cut the price in half it would be a great meal worth the price until then i would avoid this place i wont be returning unless they do
  i wish i could give zero stars our waitress was nice service was horrible food was not worth the long wait
  best restaurant still open in this beautiful community excellent wine list and terrific food in a tuscan setting w a lovely patio on lake mead i like the italian dishes the salmon and steaks service could be better but overall this is a romantic getaway easy on your wallet
  food was ok but not something special i have tasted much better dishes
  great service great food loved the jerome burger perfectly cooked waitress was upbeat and got everything just right this was the perfect spot to eat in between stadium tours
  we were looking for something quick for dinner and realized there just aren t many chinese food restaurants in the area we d already tried our closest one and wanted to try something different then we remember wok in express on gibson went on a week night and the restaurant was empty nothing special looking but there are a lot of dine in tables which is surprising for your typical chinese food joint i placed my order while my husband was still mulling over what to get he orders a teriyaki bowl and the man shakes his head no for a second we were wondering what this meant no as in we can t order that finally he says i can t let you order japanese food at a chinese restaurant i have to have it on the menu but it s just not as good this was puzzling i mean why have something on the menu that you don t want to serve still my husband appreciated his honesty and opted for beef and broccoli instead the man threw in 2 veggie egg rolls and i got a free fountain soda for checking in the food was ready quickly and the portions were large we both enjoyed our meals and especially loved the chicken fried rice the prices were ok i liked that they marked the takeout boxes to let us know which was which we ll definitely return when we re in the mood for chinese takeout
  we usually pick up a to go order due to the cramped quarters you are literally sitting on top of the next table be prepared to a long wait if you order to go sushi preparers are more interested in pleasing the over indulging drinkers at the sushi bar while taking shots yes of liquor with them even saw the waitress join in the over indulgers are a constant scene i have witnessed on many occassions big turn off hey i like my happy hour drinks too but have some class
  the nightclub opens around 5 and is directly on top of and open with the restaurant it was so noisy i had to talk loudly for my fiance to hear me the satay of chilean sea bass was great the filet mignon was over cooked and dry the chinese sausage fried rice and buddhas feast were both good the service was sub par on our visit service was so slow we had to rush to make our show
  popped in last night for the first time a really impressed had the cod taco which was excellent and the chicken special which was pretty good too both the guacamole and salsa were fresh and we ll prepared only the chips were ordinary finally friendly helpful service made for a great evening
  i trust chris b on these types of things so his glowing review plus jason l s description of these sexy magical strands had me aching to try nudo we hit it up on january first i love you for being open right off the bat and were gleefully not disappointed the noodles are in fact pulled fresh before your eyes and are soft plump perfect and the broth on my beef flank noodle soup was swoon worthy lots of perfectly mouth watering beef crisp lovely veg and a quantity so pleasingly hearty i have noodle soup calling my name from the fridge as we speak my dinner dates were all delighted as well including the vegan who was able to swap the chicken broth for all veg though her soup could have had more veg in it actually load up our animal loving friends when you can restauranteurs they are hungry we tried 7 different salads each at about 1 50 a pop and they were all tasty the cucumber radish and potato salads were the table favourites all this good eating plus a beer and we walked out each paying under 20 including tax and tip super homerun win of a way to ring in 2013
  nice menu selection looked clean and well kept food was ok not very hot when served will go again though give them another chance
  this place is amazing to say the least i ve been looking for amazing thai food and thanks to some friends i found it we ordered about 7 different dishes and they were all delicious you will definitely find me here
  came down here from los angeles for the weekend and we decided to stop here for breakfast it was probably the best part out of all my trip the food was great and our waitress was the sweetest friendliest lady we came across i would definitely come back to vegas just for this place
  the crust makes the pizza crispy and friggin good well played secret pizza well played
  great service and friendly staff i had the tuna salad and the tuna was albacora fresh and the greens were the good kind and not just iceburg i would recomend this place
  solid spot on the lunch train and unless i m just a silly pants blind person the only location with what i like to call japanese fast food you know the kind of place where they just know everyone s going to pour the shrimp sauce all over everything so they give you a nice big plastic thing of it i did not partake in the hibachi menu had some sushi and a garden salad with that delicious sesame ginger dressing that really only tastes right from a place like this sushi isn t the best in the world but it s not grocery store quality either salad was fresh and crunchy and i like the challenge of eating salad with chopsticks a nice addition to the uptown lunch choices and since i m across the street it s just the right amount of walking in the sun from one place to the next all in all a solid spot gets a bid loud at the peak of lunchtime though bring a megaphone or be a loudmouth like me
  outstanding atmosphere food and drink you won t be disappointed
  a decision to go to woo che is almost always based off price not quality woo chee is probably the most affordable cheapest of the ayce kbbq offerings here in vegas at about 13 for ayce after 11pm this place is a great value but as many of fellow yelpers have noted this value does cost a diner in terms of quality i am not saying that the quality food here is bad but it could be alot better after 11pm they essentially stop replenishing the food in the buffet except for the meat and diners are free to get whatever is left when i got there are around midnight last week i noticed that all of the salad and much of banchan offerings were depleted the meat itself is not bad but really impressive either the spicy chicken is great and not offered at the other kbbq places and the jalapeno soy sauce is addition i wasn t too impressed with their cuts for the bulgogi and beef as it seemed like it was mostly fat on it the interior is like most kbbq places minimalistic but this place definitely has a cafeteria like feel to it woo che is a great value but there is a sacrifice on quality sura down the street offers a much larger variety of food in the same buffet style set up but is around 22 a pop
  decent place for quick chinese i don t like the fact that they don t serve the food in authentic chinese take out containers but hey its still ok i don t go there often but when i don t feel like going across town to my favorite place i pick this one in a quick pinch plus the owners are really nice
  cool after work hangout in north scottsdale incredibly crappy service disguised with nice legs in fishnet stockings beers are pricey except during happy hour their dry ribs are a must try ok i like it
  the service was spectacular and the food was too we did a travelzoo deal which i feared might result in less service but it was not the case at all we had a wonderful 3 course meal and added on the lobster too they had a special on wines over 100 so we took the plunge to compliment the meal with a french burgundy and it really stood up to the expertly cooked meal as well i m not typically a dessert person but the chocolate souffle was mouth melting heaven definitely coming back and hopefully getting my wines in there too i think it d be good company oh and the decor was beautiful elegant yet intimate too nice big private booth type seating oh la la i can t wait to return
  more food for your money than thai bail lemongrass or other thai places of that caliber i had 71 or 72 which should tell you how extensive their menu is which was beef with green beans and carrots i ordered 10 hot on a 10 point scale and it was hot but not unbearable like i said it s about the same as the others the service was so slow but the woman was nice and offered dessert because one of our members is a long time customer put it on your list if you haven t tried it
  o m g when it is 2am and you are starving this place is golden the cheese oozing burger was to die for the shakes were ahhhmazing it is so great to have a decent meal in vegas that will not cost you an arm and a leg and is good i would highly recommend this place head over towards nyny to find this amazing burger joint
  maybe i just ordered the wrong foods but really if you can t get a margherita pizza right i m afraid to order anything else i do not understand how this place got such great reviews i started with a white sangria no fruits and it tasted like a watered down limoncello this was followed by the beet salad everyone knows that you cannot toss soft cheeses such as brie or goat cheese in a salad it has to be added after the toss otherwise this happens where s the cheese why do the beets look like they have mold growing on them yes this happened for reals now about that pizza first it was watery and burnt that is a feat that seems impossible but it happened for reals the top was soggy and watery the crust was purposely overcooked but the charred flavor of the crust was overwhelming enough for me to put the slice down and start feeling like my stomach was developing cancer i will not come back and i refuse to recommend or bring anyone here
  hahaha almost a 5 star a j almost my girlfriend and i loved this place their pizzas are absolutely fabulous i had the bbq chicken and my girlfriend had the anton james chipotle and chicken hers was slightly under seasoned and mine tasted perfect the service was great the ambience is amazing and i love the views at night from upstairs my only complaint is if i were to pay for a 4 hot chocolate i expect real chocolate in my cup with 100 milk instead what i tasted was chocolate powder and hot water which was slightly disappointing at any rate this is your go to place for pizza in downtown simply wonderful
  went there for lunch had the main entre polish sampler excellent my boyfriend s dad is first generation polish and his mom is first generation german so i get a lot both polish german food in fact that is all we get at their house so it is hard to find a restaurant with authentic food the fresh kielbasa was great sauerkraut was savvory not sour which was excellent pierogies delicious and my favorite golabki stuffed cabbage was delicious only wish they had a tomato or mushroom sauce not just catchup well i m about to burst with all the good food i love that it is individually owned and operated by a polish couple service was excellent
  60 steaks a la carte that writing on a menu should make me believe this will be the best steak i had ever eaten for the winter season they had the taster menu starting at 110 so me and a few buddies split that while our big winner in the group got the grade 10 kobe filet mignon on here i see reviews state its the best steak they had ever had great i want to believe them but after eating i really question if they had been outside outback before this stuff is far from the best infact i had better 30 steaks while traveling through the dakotas mid west and even some areas outside nyc this is one of the rare instances where yelp is completely wrong with the review i will never go back because the meat is not worth the price simply put even the 200 steak was just a great steak ive had great steaks at 10 that price the sides were mediocre nothing spectacular yukon gold puree raw kobe tartar mushrooms truffles not cooked enough i can see im harping on the price of the products here but its hard to not let it affect my decision look at sherry t s review its very accurate
  great service and delicious mexican food everything is served with lots of cheese yummy love the sopapillas with honey too
  the linguine side for 7 blew me out of the water the simplicity and excellent taste were beyond any other food we had in vegas this place redefines fresh pizzas we had a spectacular lamb chorizo pizza
  just ordered take out from this place so this is just on the food alone and not on service the hubby and i ordered the beef jerky laab salad pork spicy basil chicken and pad kee mao beef the spice level on all were 6 except for the pad kee mao which was a 7 i have to say all in all we were very happy with the food especially with the laab we have had the larb at lotus of siam and chada thai and we prefer lucki thai s over both places please support this place i peeked in the kitchen and everything looked super clean did i mention they deliver too i was always a lotus snob after trying other thai spots and this has changed my mind the only thing i would say was negative is that it is right across the street from my house and i will now be frequenting this place way more than i should flavors are amazing balanced and complex just what thai cuisine is i even called them after my meal to tell them how good of a job they are doing
  there 6 lunch specials are fantastic service is always good waitresses are cute and the place has a good positive vibe i might give them 5 stars after i check out their happy hour or actually go there for dinner
  the plan was to come here for food and it had been highly recommended sadly i only made it for beers and i may have not reviewed it at all but i thought you yelpers deserve a warning first before the warning it s a cool looking modern bar comfy seats and a laid back atmosphere it does craft beers and has funky murals on the wall all sounds good eh it is actually a nice place for a beer or two the kicker in the story is the bill three bottles of ipa ordinary size bottles they cost 15 10 the barman might as well have had a mask and asked for our wallets so in sum nice place for a beer just be ready for the bill to be far higher than anywhere else on broughton street that i visited alright treacle
  i was in vegas last month we were looking for a quick place for dinner first off the restaurant was beautiful the service was great very helpful and the food the food was perfection i will definitely come back here again
  saw a groupon special for these guys 20 bucks for an all day play card plus a 10 dollar gift card i immediately grabbed 2 of them for my 2 boys ages 13 and 10 thought it was an awesome deal until we showed up on a saturday yes i can understand that it was gonna be busy because of the fact that it was a saturday but that s not my gripe my gripe is that a lot of the games were not working i would say about 40 percent were out of order even some of the newer games like the tank one my youngest noticed you can only go forward and cannot reverse so he was stuck behind a wall the whole game not able to do anything but get shot at another gripe is that other parents had the same idea so of course my kids had to wait for their kids to get off a game once they ran out of lives but in most cases they would just keep swiping their card basically just hogging the game the whole time there should be some kind of limit on how many times you can continue on an all day play pass for they can literally stay on a game the whole day which is rude in my opinion i also understand that since we had the unlimited play card it wouldnt generate any game tickets for obvious reasons this did not bother me at all again since some of the games were out of order the kids tried to make the most of it even the standard interactive games like the basketball shot one only 4 out of the 6 was working but technically only 2 was worthy of playing due to those having a decent amount of balls to play with while the others had only 2 or 3 looking around i saw some of the balls were stuck on top of the actual arcade after about 90 minutes of playing the same games over and over again my kids were bored already to the point they just wanted to go home memo to the gameworks staff dont you guys have some kind of technician that is on the clock repairing those games that are broke at least a person that can keep the basketballs in order on the basketball arcade i am so disappointed from our visit that i dont see any reason to come back here you guys should change your name to gameswork because after coming here i am left scratching my head thinking do any of the games work yelp 2015 review 36 gameworks sometimes 535 overall
  had the ayce sushi lunch for 19 95 choose from appetizers noodles rice like kimichi chicken fried rice teriyaki chicken nigiri tempura rolls specialty rolls and vanilla strawberry green tea ice cream for dessert miso was very bland had zero flavor ordered the shrimp tempura and black dragon roll and lisa lisa roll avocado cream cheese and shrimp tempura yummy overall this place was decent great service and affordable prices
  i went here after i saw a friend post this on facebook after it was on triple d i went there around 8 30pm on a saturday night right before they were closing and it was still packed waiting a good 15 mins just to order what i got fontina burger with onion rings excellent grilled bbq chicken pizza somewhat tasty but i was full from my burger vanilla shake the blue cherry hit the spot also had a bite of the peanut butter and banana sandwich which is somewhat great but i couldn t eat it as a meal if i went to phx i would highly recommend this place
  the best place to eat after 1 a m if you haven t tried their szechwan beef noodle soup then try that first or have at least one person from your group order this dish my second favorite dish mooshoo chicken pork chinese style burritos with hoison sauce trust me you won t be disappointed we stop by everytime we re in vegas just like the regulars stop by el taurino in l a we stop by here in vegas hopefully you like it as much as we do
  elie and i came in for happy hour drinks and i m really glad we did the bar is lovely and the actual restaurant is really nice the drinks were delicious and strong and everything from the sour pickle martini to the smoky mezcal was excellent we had two drinks each sampling four decadent cocktails for only 24 i heart happy hour and this one rocks the food looked great worth trying next time around
  most every morning they mess up my coffee i don t understand the order board reads 8 sugars and my receipt reads 8 sugars and then my coffee comes out with all cream and no sugar i just don t understand
  had the worst experience with the food truck at first friday with a horribly rude employee working the window i purchased food and saw my food sit on the counter as new orders were stacked on top of mine 3 more orders to be exact the 4 orders sat for 4 5 minutes waiting on fries and as the orders were being called mine now on the bottom was called last order 96 as i saw her hand out 99 98 97 as i was asking for my order she ignored me as i asked her why it was waiting on the bottom when i didnt order fries i still had to wait for them because they were busy then the employee told me to shut up and refused to refund my order with so much competition its not a great idea to blow off your guests never again
  o goodness was this place amazing there wasn t anything that was disliked here we will be back without question
  it s been more than a week and this afternoon i was driving down the street thinking how much i was looking forward to the burger i know i m going to have for dinner tonight when i remembered it came back to me like a flash of light the most delicious burger i had recently i mean my mouth had the memory really the texture was perfect it was thick but moist not dense juicy and despite a giant bun the bread was soft and not overpowering where did i have that fantastic burger first frustration i know it s not the burger i m having tonight where was i when i had that burger i called dottsy z because i vaguely remembered her being present for the experience with her help i remembered it was the burger i split with don s a k a donjay at district man that was a good burger now i m a little less looking forward to the burger i m having tonight although a value it will not be as good i m grateful for the memory and can assure you the next time someone asks where can i get a great burger downtown i ll remember i recommend adding green chile quite possibly my favorite downtown downtown happy hour the pretzel fondue is a steal as are the well drinks
  zookz is the best sandwich in the game period most sandwiches in phoenix are overpriced traditional particular boring whereas zookz is cheap unique healthy everyone from management to the cashiers are respectful loving i am always excited to eat the best sandwich in phoenix
  mexican food our favorite my husband and i have tried almost every mexican restaurant in vegas and this is our favorite we eat here almost every monday night i get the chicken and beef fajitas and he gets the camarones chipotle con crema everyone is so friendly the service is excellent try it for yourself
  this is one of our favorite thai restaurant in phoenix the food is excellent things you must try tom yum soup pad kee mao tom kha soup garlic chicken and mango delight their green tea ice cream is to die for another must try item though not on the menu i think
  got a salad for lunch the salad was small for the price also for such a small salad the service was slow for the same price jason s deli or energy cafe offers a much salad double the quantity for the same price i will not be returning for that reason service at the register was superb and the restaurant was clean so that was positive
  most amazing bagels n they always put a ton of cream cheese which is awesome because most places are cheap and give you one thin spread def recommend
  it s a classic can t hate on that haven t had a complete trip to the pitts without eating at primanti brothers ya know when you have a heaping pile napkins that it s finger lickn good always cheap and fulfilling doesn t get better than that cajun chicken is the bomb i must say
  the place was very dirty we sat looking at a table full of dirty dishes the entire time we were there a girl was sweeping or what should have been sweeping however she was missing everything stuff all over the floor my wife ordered the fajitas and they waited ten minutes to come and tell her they were out of beef i also have a problem with them charging for table entertainment for the use of the tablet at the table no where does it say you will be charged for its use that should be illegal
  i had the margarita pizza it was nothing spectacular the restaurant was clean and one of the least smoky places inside the golden nugget
  i have heard and read so many reviews about this place that i finally decided to check it out for myself just walking into the place it smelled so appetizing that i couldn t wait to start eating our waitress was very friendly and helpful with choosing the things off the menu because this is definitely not what you would call a typical burger joint we started off with the thai iced tea and then ordered the miyagi sans grass fed wagyu burger and the truffle parmesan fries the food did take a while to come out but that is because everything is prepared fresh the burger consisted of chili mayo fried egg crispy onion rings and caramelized onions it was so big that i could barely try to take a bite out of it the wagyu was so tender that it just melted in my mouth there was so much flavor in the burger that each bite put a smile on my face there is no certain way to describe the truffle parmesan fries with the dipping sauce except that it was like a party in my mouth the fries are drizzled with black truffle porcini cream and grated parmesan all the food is very reasonably priced and i wish i had room to try some of their dessert i can t wait to go back and try the different burgers and desserts on the menu i m not even a huge burger fan but i am in love with this place
  reuben s is a must on every montreal visit now melt in the mouth meat on great bread with stringy fries
  if your looking to have authentic mexican food then dont bother coming to elviras they serve you tortilla chips from a bag not freshly made as you would expect it comes with bottled salsa again not freshly made as you would also expect the food is sub par there were only 2 of us and they still got the order wrong the restaurant was less than half full but it took around 25 minutes to get our food slowwww service our waitress didn t check on us to refill our drinks so instead the bus boy did it for us first and last time going there
  i am not a pizza snob to me pizza hut papa johns dominos etc is sufficient to satisfy my pie cravings thus i am usually hesitant to hit up actual pizza restaurants unless the place offers personal pizzas you have to negotiate toppings with whoever you are sharing with and i am sure we all have that friend who thinks anchovies is a must have on top of that pizza restaurants are comparably overpriced compared to their take out delivery siblings with that in mind grimaldi s serves up some pretty good pizza but to me fails to impress their ingredients are for the most part better than their chain counter parts the pizzas aren t greasy or heavy in fact they only seem to have thin crust pizzas no deep dish for chi town peeps they are a bit overpriced for what you get and considering that they don t offer any custom or specialties pizzas i m left wondering i just overpaid for a simple pepperoni pizza i wish they had some more stand out ingredients or maybe a signature combo i ve been to this spot a few times and the service is pretty average the patio is a nice touch but the restaurant itself is pretty small call ahead on the weekends as most pizza joints have a slower turn over time and get packed on busier days
  this is the five star service and food you expect in las vegas the steak was cooked to the exact temperature it was juicy and buttered just enough my codfish was steamed to perfection being soft and delectable but firm on the fork the staff was also very friendly while still being professional the ambiance is elegant with just a splash of miami night club cheese which they have to have considering that the casino looks like frontier land at disneyland i would love to eat here again
  first time we ate here it was at the barbary coast the pit boss gave us a comp and told us to have the dinner of our life we kinda internally rolled our eyes thinking eh yeah right but cool we ll take a free meal wow we were wrong over the years we have kept coming back even though it s now at the south point a little bit away from the strip it s truly a gem it s very expensive but the service is hands down the best service i ve ever had in my life the food is great and each time we return it s the same servers who i m sure make a pretty penny working there all in all it s a fabulous dinning experience truly an experience
  love the food great price excellent customer service very friendly staff we would definitely come back here
  wendy s noodle cafe located at the western edge of chinatown in las vegas is a non descript looking building in which it in it s former life was a pizza restaurant wendy herself is a middle aged asian lady who re located from san diego a couple of year s ago first impression upon entering small place nothing fancy most of the patrons were androgynous college aged asians thought to myself glad my kids didn t go through this fashion phase i think when they were this age baggy pants were the fashion statement onto the food mango pudding no asian restaurant that i ve been to prepares mango pudding like this wendy s mango pudding is a triple layered pudding made with gelatin not milk based that you ll find at most other asian restaurants the pudding looked ok triple layered top and bottom layer were more opaque than the center layer which contained bits of mango ok in flavor but i didn t order j e l l o all the layers were made with gelatin all previous mango pudding ordered at asian restaurants were never made like this rating on yelp reduced to 3 stars based mainly on this disappointment 82 singapore noodles 1 2 perfectly made on a 6 square porcelain plate you ll receive thin vermicelli noodles with bean sprouts slivers of green onion red and green bell peppers stir fried with medium sized shrimp and slivers of chinese bbq pork smaller portion than at most asian restaurants salt pepper tofu 1 2 the square cubes of tofu are prepared like any other salt pepper entree fried at a high temperature until the tofu looks like small sandstone colored bricks the chef then tops off the entree with green onions and most impoerantly some sliced jalapeno peppers which gives this entree a real kick very very good i think the kids had some trepidations upon my ordering this entree but it became the most popular salt pepper calimari 41 won ton soup kathy s order of soup which she said tasted funny btw 15 minimum on debit credit cards
  good quality food and very consistent my group enjoyed the chicken tikka masala lamb karahi mutter paneer peas and homemade cheese in a coconut curry sauce with basmati rice and aloo paratha naan with potatoes and peas their vegetable samosas are pretty tasty too service could be much better we had to wait awhile to order the food dessert and then again for the ticket btw portions are pretty slim but the flavors all but make up for the small portions
  very good pizza i had the italian stallion if you love meat this is your choice crust cooked very well in the wood burning oven pretty good lunch crowd service was good my only complaint is that the smallest pie is 12 great for 2 too much for one while cold pizza is great at 7 am after sleeping one off it is so much better when still retaining original heat maybe if they offer a single serve pie lunch could stay under 20 for one
  wonderful place this is a wonderful out of the way old fashioned place the food is very good comfort food the entire place is spotless and the staff is amazing a visit here is like stepping back in time
  try the pizza regina delicious it comes with ham and mushrooms the ham thats on the pizza was thin cut and delicious it just melted in our mouths waiter was so polite and professional def next time i come to vegas i will be eating at suede
  this is my second time coming here for lunch and it was delicious todd english olives is located across from tiffany s and really close to the side valet super easy in out we sat our on the patio when it was like 90 100 degrees there weren t any misters on yet and the fountains never went off during our entire hour lunch kind of a bummer service was pretty good the server forgot my guests drink twice but it was quickly replenished when we brought it up i ordered chilled crab salad mixed greens asparagus shaved fennel cucumber roma tomato red onion mandarin segments red pepper coulis champagne vinaigrette 17 it was perfect for a super hot day my guest ordered a flatbread and really enjoyed it i also ordered a flavored iced tea that was really good maybe it was peach i would definitely come back here very good for a business lunch
  my favourite brunch spot in edinburgh bar none unique menu fresh juices and cozy decor still a winner
  a loooooot of hype about this place has been going on since i have been talking about how i was going to be in vegas this past weekend great local feel all the employees were like auntys and uncles hawaii slang and it was as if i was dining at some restaurant at home i had a hard time choosing between chicken katsu and the katsu loco moco they both sounded soo so osoo oosoosooo good not to mention the people around me were eating katsu loco mocos and i might have droooled a little but i stuck with ordering the plain katsu because i knew i wasnt going to be able to finish all of my food and so i thought it would be easier to save saving a katsu loco moco makes me think of soggy chicken katsu and idk if i am really a fan of that katsu was on point i love it when katsu is crispy and their katsu was just that omg and their macaroni salad was super delicious too they have huge pieces of pepper and it really gave your mouth a little kick while eating it i enjoyed that 2 scoops rice a mound of katsu and 1 scoop mac salad for 9 win win win they also give you a nice container of sauce im a sauce lover so i need lots of sauce 3 plus the service was so friendly and wonderful you need to eat half of your plate to get a take out box jokingly of course but we laughed i think all of us were a little beat up from clubbing and shennanigans from the night before so eating a large meal of meat and rice was not high up on the agenda before a 6 hour car ride to la still delicious though and i am actually eating my leftovers as i type this
  i am so full great food always wanted to share some pictures it s so hard not to eat the food before i take the picture tonight i tried something called magic carpet ok i was skeptical too but you gotta try it btw i don t like cream cheese but its good spicy tuna tomato cream cheese and kiwi on a crispy fried won ton skin omg sounds weird the kiwi and all but who would have imagine that its so yummy give it a try
  vegetarian perspective so upon seeing a very cool show called recycled percussion my friend alida shout out and i decided to get some grub it was her pick so tis all her fault haha kidding pros great parking space easy to find directionally friendly service cheap i ll take quality over price any day beautiful ambiance seat yourself vibe with casual attire etc neg has to do with showing up with an empty stomach but open mind and thinking it s ramen i love ramen not a vegan so there s bound to be something alida was kind enough to initiate the question of what do you have for veg s response nothing nothing for vegetarian i do highly appreciate that the waitress knew her menu and communicated that to me honestly upon an awkward shall we leave look she offered to have a dish of fried rice egg no pork custom made and it was delicious just sucked being hungry but hey it was a good meal reasonably priced alida enjoyed her dish and she is not allowed to choose the next restaurant ha
  we ordered 2 appetizers 3 entrees and 2 desserts we finished all cuz the french taste is never heavy and all ingredients just go well and balance each other this place is indeed nice and all foods are so delicate and delicious it s the second time i came in the first time is 4 yrs ago when i traveled with fds to canada although they have a small variety choice on menu they do change it once a while i wanted to order a duck based entree cuz the pics on yelp looks good but they don t have it anymore will come back later probably as my expectations is still rolling d
  gaucho parrilla argentina would make an excellent ambassador for pittsburgh s food scene to any transplants or tourists arriving in the city it s simultaneously a one of the best sandwich makers in the city that stands out from the crowd and b a restaurant that fits right in with the growing and diverse offerings of an increasingly delicious strip district with many cuts of steak available in sandwich or platter form i m a fan of the sandwiches myself none of the options are bad choices you could make random selections from this menu and still be just as happy as if you put hours into crafting your order it s all great stuff and i have no advice to visitors other than get a steak sandwich and anything else that looks good to you you won t be disappointed the primary drawback is space it can be hard to find a place to eat once your food is ready especially if the weather closes the outdoor seating area still it s worth the wait in line and the hassle of seating though it s still a far cry from being good for groups
  the food is great and the drinks are strong two drinks and you are feeling happy
  place is legit have had dinner and breakfast here and was happy both times more people should come here and spread the word the vibe is chill and the staff is somewhat nice some need a tip of smile and be nice
  great atmosphere great view great drinks great food there is nothing that disappoints me more than paying for a mediocre meal mon ami gabi always lives up to my vegas expectations this place was such a treat i enjoyed some fresh oysters shrimp cocktails house baked bread and a main course while sipping on frangria a french sangria and enjoying the bellagio water view you can enjoy a dinner with friends or a romantic dinner with your significant other
  i order from here often more so because it s close and the minimum is only 10 which you cannot beat especially when their lunch special runs until 4pm quick delivery i order the cashew chicken only with a taro bubble tea although i order at least once every month i do feel there are better tasting chinese food else where doesn t take away from the pros i feel are worth it if you have no transportation
  my last review of this place was 3 2011 and i still love the hell outta this place the food is very good varied and inexpensive they have a really great happy hour too my faves are their spicy korean beef crispy calamari and sushi combo great deal service is consistently spotty we went about a month ago and our server kept breaking glasses as she was really rushed that was annoying as we were seated by where she was breaking the glasses i love the bread they bring to the table but when i recently ordered takeout 45 worth of food the guy told me they no longer provide it free for takeout and would have to charge per roll cheap regardless i love this place and will continue to return even if i have to deal with the inconsistencies
  the ribeye is a must order the chicken entree as an appetizer enjoy the best two things on the menu
  i am not even sure this qualifies as a hole in the wall with that said their food is the bomb try the confeit or pork belly one of the best sandwiches i have ever had
  i was very dissatisfied with my first visit to this restaurant i saw some nice pictures from friends and i wanted to experience the same early in the afternoon they had run out of two popular dishes big bone soup and lobster pho as well as their coconut ice cream i know certain dishes in restaurants do run out due to popular demand but in those cases i would expect the staff to at least suggest alternative dishes they didn t even do that or show much empathy to the fact that i was disappointed that they didn t have what i wanted this staff lacks customer service and pride for their food and restaurant what i got was a waitress that alternated with another waiter while they clearly displayed a miscommunication of service at the beginning these two made them selves available to take our order at different times when we had already given our order to one of them then they alternated breaking the news of the dishes they ran out of in my opinion one unavailable dish is permissible two is cause for concern and three means they may need to fire their purchaser they have good product but the business is amateur my visit was 1 3 15
  mert s was amazing i had the fried chicken mac n cheese and collards good sized servings at really good prices my boyfriend got the beef ribs mashed potatoes and mac n cheese everything was delicious the waitress we had was on point she was friendly energetic and extremely fast i will be going back
  ate here for lunch with the wife we shared the smashed meatball sandwich i started with a caesar salad and i do not know what they do to those croutons but damn they are good head up on the salad they are heavy with the anchovies i did not mind it and almost licked my salad plate clean then the meatball sub came out the meatballs were awesome the bread nice and crunchy and the right amount of cheese more mozzarella than ricotta we both enjoyed the meal and left full the waiter seemed like he was in pain the way he was moving around almost like he through he back out of something so maybe that was why we did not seem to be in that great of a mood all and all a great meal and will try it again on another trip
  rude waitress she didn t listen didn t get the order right but i bet if i was a guy alone she would have paid attention noisy noisy and cold not a pleasant environment for dinner the wings were like jerky just as dry and tough but the pizza was good not enough for me to want to actually eat there again
  pretty good this place ranks a close second out of the top 3 buffets in vegas i think wicked spoon has the best food and a more hip cosmopolitan ambiance however bacchanal has much better food than wynn buffet ambiance at wynn is probably more elegant though overall i enjoyed my meal we had a good server who made sure to bring additional sodas and take away our plates they had crab legs that were halved making the crab meat easy to access the people behind the counter seemed rather lazy and reluctant to warm the crab legs but at least they did i can t remember any particular buffet dish that stands out the dining area is quite comfortable the lighting is just right and the seats are comfortable too the buffet looks new clean and nice if wicked spoon wasn t open this would be the next buffet choice for sure
  my wife and i ordered takeout from brugos alarm bells should have been ringing when i walked in to pick up my order and found the place almost empty and the only people who were in there were at the bar drinking not eating basically if you like poor quality pizza this is the place for you i ordered a caesar salad which for some reason had tomato in it if you can t make a caesar salad right what hope the rest of the stuff and so it proved cheesy garlic bread was next up it was basically a pizza base absolutely covered in pretty tasteless mozzarella i can only assume they forgot to add garlic since i certainly couldn t taste any of it so basically it was cheese on toast they did include a small pot of what i presume was supposed to be marinara sauce but was instead tomato paste with some basil in it i think it was basil since this was straight out of a can tomato paste the taste of that was so overpowering it was hard to tell exactly what the green flecks of matter suspended in it were finally we get to the pizza the crowning glory of a pizza restaurant and we d only ordered a classic margarita surely a pizza restaurant can t get that wrong actually they can it was essentially more of the cheesy garlic bread only this time instead of putting the marinara sauce in a pot they had helpfully layered it underneath the tasteless mozzarella it effectively rendered the tasteless mozzarella a binding agent only so overpowering was the tomato paste there were some tiny pieces of chopped basil on top of the pizza that were completely defeated by the overpowering tomato no fresh tomato on the pizza though presumably they had used all of them in the caesar salad this place was saved from the embarrassment of one star by the fact the order was prepared quickly when i phoned it in they said it would take 30 minutes but when i turned up in 20 minutes it was ready for me of course had i waited the 30 minutes they d said it would have gone cold but i m feeling charitable really avoid this place i ve genuinely had better from pizza hut added on 11 5 13 i ve just seen the owners response to my review and had to comment further they proudly claim that our margarita pizza is my sicilian families recipe why does that make the slightest bit of difference just because your family is from sicily doesn t mean they can cook they might be terrible at cooking their recipes might have been considered the worst in sicily maybe that s why they had to move to the usa so slavishly following them doesn t mean your product will be any good where any of your produce comes from and the recipes followed is irrelevant if the end product doesn t taste any good do you actually taste the homemade sauce you use and make sure it doesn t taste like overpowering rubbish you can get from a can oh and by the way thanks for pointing out that i could have requested you not put tomato on the caesar salad it s nice to know that it was in fact my fault that i didn t get what any normal person would consider a caesar salad
  growing up on old school country i have wanted to try a gilley s for sometime just to indulge my heart and nostalgia this place is located right on strip adjacent to casinos but with a window view of the night life outside despite the what happens in vegas mentality i wanted to exercise some level of discretion and not totally let my diet go they have some grilled chicken options including the one i picked that was fresh hot not greasy and tender the karaoke and bronco riding were entertaining had some fun festive drinks on the menu after my poor tired feet had walked up and down it hit the spot
  currently sitting in drive thru going on 32 mins with only 2 cars in front of me saw 7 people walk in and come out within 5 mins of going in why have a drive thru if you re going to act like it s not there utterly ridiculous for a company whose primary appeal is speed i could have ordered barros instead
  we ve been to hanny s a dozen times before it s been our go to place when we re going to the theater or symphony normally the service is great the food is outstanding and the bar is the best around unfortunately our experience this past saturday really disappointed as always the food and drink was excellent but the experience was unbelievably marred by loud booming music and indifferent service now i know that hanny s has a dj and loud music but we were in the restaurant at 5 45 pm not midnight i asked the server if the bass could be turned down something i ve never done at a restaurant before the answer we received i m pretty sure they won t turn it down and i m not even sure they can hmmm the music changed and the distracting boom of the bass subsided for a few minutes but another track and more annoyance our server didn t seem to want to be bothered to even ask sadly i guess we won t be bothered to return
  was good i like the seafood entrees i d ask for a little leaner salmon cut and a less creamy rice bed also how about warm bread with oil and vinaigrette the bread wasn t warm and only served with oil just a suggestion
  this is a bit over due and ergo hazy but i remember the chips and salsa were nothing short of ah mazing i was in town for thanksgiving and the man and i made the trek here to meet up with an old high school friend that i hadn t seen in well in awhile the food was great and the chips and salsa did i mention ah mazing we stayed around after they left and moved to the bar but oddly enough after another round or so of drinks and way before the asu cal game was over the place was closing up and like 10or 11ish weird other than the chips salsa i don t really have a reason to drive to bfe mom in surprise dad in fountain hills and i live out of state but i really enjoyed the place
  the food was good the prices was a little steep 10 little pieces of shanghi lumpia for 8 00 are you kidding me
  all i can say is kids eat free on sunday i have a family of five and it s not cheep to go out to eat i feed everyone foe 25 bucks it s great and the kids get free ice cream
  i ve been here a few times now for all the fun edm extravaganzas that they put forth i m pleased to say that i haven t been let down once there aren t that many bars in north scottsdale that are actually worthy of bragging about its a bit of a hidden location but hey who cares there is a pool cabanas and a young crowd entertaining crowd that fills the place with good times the only thing that kept this review from being 5 stars is that the bartenders jip you on drinks i would like some alchohol with my little cup full of ice looking forward to zeds dead on the 8th
  this review is for the kosher market not for the adjacent restaurant which i have never tried i drive 20 miles to get here a couple of times a month why not for the prices which are in line with other kosher stores in this area but definitely not cheap not for the ambiance which is clean but crowded and a little disorderly here s why imperial kosher tries to serve the needs of the kosher community in a very small store and it succeeds selection is surprisingly large for such a small space they seem to have most of the essentials including meats cheeses and a full service deli most importantly somebody has spent time trying to get good quality products on the shelves not everything marked kosher is something you would enjoy eating but imperial has found a lot of worthy items don t be afraid to try a brand you don t know well this is a true family place so don t expect supermarket like efficiency but do expect friendly service and people who care about their customers imperial suggestion for your restaurant at off hours anyway consider making it into a self service coffee tea bar make some reading materials available sell a few pastries maybe your customers will hang around for a while you could be a cool meeting place
  great sunday happy hour the food is absolutely delicious and the staff very friendly and efficient
  one of the best dinner buffets we have had fresh quality and a lot of different variety of food yum def going back when we go to vegas
  let me get the logic behind secret pizza they re opened to 4 5 a m the drunk and partially drunk slur their way in to get that sober me up munchies on wouldn t you want a sign up to attract more customers how passively cruel is that to the wobbly and incoherent wandering like zombies seeking to feed one could only chuckle at the priceless visual as they search for secret pizza contrarians sober people would say signs would defeat the purpose of their marketing goal it wouldn t be called secret pizza logic is never logic if drunk through the corridor on the right of the japanese restaurant within the cosmopolitan you ll find secret pizza there i said it if that s not enough you re probably too drunk to even eat within this hallway is a massive collection of interesting prints of musicians i think they were musicians the pizza aroma pulled my attention away from the pictures my monstrous hunger which developed from searching the menu told me to get two slices give up looking for a poster board list menu or what have you just ask because there are none peering down through the glass i eventually chose the meat lovers and the cheese with white sauce pizzas are the thin crust my crusts were a tad burnt on the edges after the oven warm up each crispy bite was filled with a healthy so to speak dose of cheese and ingredients both slices were delicious both had surprisingly good taste considering since they were just thrown into an oven and reheated for a minute no time for a sit down dinner want a quick slice or whole pizza or need some grease to relieve your drunkenness secret pizza can be a strong option that is if you can find it
  sushi koma i love sushi night mighty roll everytime yummy d best sushi place ever and amazing staff one time i was cold and they turned the air down for me _
  5star service our first time here and everything couldn t have been more perfect from the looks of the giant video billboard outside advertising 5 99 lunch specials we expected average mexican fare we got much more not only was the food excellent the service was equal to the likes of the pointe the food brunch served from 10 30 4 00 i got the south of the border ranch style eggs with pork chile verde eggs basted the taste of the pork was superb you can tell everything is made fresh the food didn t come out in 5 minutes either so it s apparent they take their time making everything to order she had the breakfast tostada substituting fajitas veggies for the meat otherwise served with chorizo again all the ingredients were fresh and tasty the little things john our waiter is low key extremely helpful and knowledgeable he knows how to adapt many dishes for the vegetarian and gluten free eaters we never had to ask for a thing if we needed an extra napkin it was on the table before we had to ask used creamer and sugar packets were immediately bussed a new cup of coffee was on the table just as i was finishing my last sip the manager jason made a nice appearance and welcomed us after the meal john spent a little extra time socializing but otherwise he was the invisible waiter who took care of all our needs we ll be back and next time we re bringing our son on sundays for face painting and because kids eat free thanks arriba
  went there with the hubby and 3 friends for breakfast yesterday and was very impressed the restaurant was busy and active and the ambience was very diner friendly we had a waiter who was really friendly and a lot of fun making us laugh and really being social he really impressed us all with his ability to memorize everyone s orders and not have to write any of it down he was awesome and we left him a pretty good tip our food was really delicious everyone in our party liked what they ordered and one of our friends took the rest of their s home for later i had the lil jay which featured a waffle and cheesy eggs and added a chicken breast to my order had ice cold grape kool aid with it my order was absolutely delicious and very tasty perfect amount of food for me and i came away feeling satisfied and content it was a good meal choice to begin the day with and i was still full when i went to the diamondbacks game later on i recommend this restaurant to anyone in search of something different
  went back to try the dim sum here last sunday havent been here in 2 years wish i wouldve stayed away the food was ok good overall for arizona but the choices and lack of food really was a turn off it was about 1245 not late by dim sum timing but they were already wiped out of all food we tried to order more there just wasnt anything to order i am chinese and very used to having to chase down the carts for food when they are busy but this was silly the tripe was definitely a unique style and the chicken feet were pretty tasty about all i can say about the food i will stick to phoenix palace for the east valley
  i love this place my boyfriend and i visit this place as often as we can for discounted bottle nights last night we had a 50 bottle for only 19 service and food is exceptional eric has served us a few times and he s very nice and knowledgeable they also project a nice movie above the bar which is a nice touch a
  a new bbq shack offering a variety of different sandwiches combo plates ribs salads wings and more you can also buy whole family sized meals and chopped bbq pork or chicken by the pound apparently by the name the ribs must be their specialty though i opted for the smothered pork sandwich which was chopped pork with slaw on a toasted bun see pics out of the 12 different sides i chose mac and cheese i wasn t impressed with the mac and cheese it was too processed for my liking but i did like the sandwich the meat had a nice flavor and the slaw was crisp and refreshing i would likely return to have that sandwich again i m gonna go with 3 stars for now until i have a chance to try some more items but all in all it was a good experience service by friendly staff in a clean industrial shack dining area looks like they have a happy vally and glendale location too
  great cafe diner ordered the turkey and links breakfast all american breakfast grilled cheese
  this is my go to place for breakfast my bf and i come here at least 1 a week everything on the menu is amazying the people the waitress and food is what makes us a regular customer i really recommend the breakfast and poutine yummmm
  not bad free pool and ping pong in the main bar area and 75 cent pool in the adjoining room 2 beer specials decent bartending i don t know i mean it was okay i guess didn t blow me away it was pretty loud though and the bartender girl played that three doors down song superman i think three times in a row which is just unbelievably annoying and makes me really want to give it only 2 stars but i enjoyed the pool area enough
  the best burger ever
  better then panda express thats all i can say
  the custom made pizza is amazing great sauce and toppings options all included in the price of the pizza they don t charge extra for each topping i also love their watermelon tea my family loves this place we eat here often good food and good prices
  so yelp page says open until 8pm drove all the way here employees inside with door unlocked and signage blinking open told me they were closed i stated their yelp page said hours until 8pm today assuming the owner blamed his wife for setting up the page and said the other location was open until 8pm bad service bad attitude i m really looking for a good sandwich shop i come from a great city that has much better food than las vegas and i was hoping this would be the place but i won t be going back
  really terrific bbq experience i will return every time i m in phoenix i was the first in line by opening time the line was long when i entered the owner handed me a chunk of brisket wow i was hooked i ordered burnt ends and they were just incredible also had some terrific sausage but the brisket is the shining star i would go back and order 2 lbs of the brisket if i could
  one of my favorite buffets in las vegas so many options so delicious creative and unique and great decor long wait but it s expected yummy crepe station both warm and cold crab legs choices go on and on great tasting food desserts
  watching them make the coffee is what made me give them 5 stars the atmosphere is very laid back with a very cozy kind of layout the people are very nice and the cappuccino is definitely on point you can t take it to go bc of the art of the foam made on top and i think that is amazing this place is truly a great coffee shop and this is their second location i found out and hopefully they will keep adding more it s great and will definitely come back every chance i get back in arizona
  i m just going to throw it out there right away i had modest expectations for the deck this dilworth bar restaurant has been renamed so many times in the past few years however i am happy to say that i m a big fan of the deck some friends and i strolled over to the deck to grab a few drinks after dinner inside it reminds me of a charleston style restaurant very beach focused with a large bar and a smattering of tables we were interested in actually sitting on the deck at the deck so we rolled on upstairs and grabbed a table with a view of east blvd my review is solely based on their drinks but i m definitely interested in heading back for some nosh the drink menu is really diverse and our friendly server mentioned that they do their best to use natural ingredients they even make their own sour mix in house the five of us ordered all different drinks beer wine and i ordered the deck margarita the margarita was right on par for 9 it was fairly large and had pleeenty of salt on the rim mmm sodium all of our drinks were tasty and priced moderately for the area i definitely want to head back to the deck for some drink specials a bit of live music and to try their strawberry basil lemonade
  grampa s is an exceptional experience we have been here twice and both visits have been lovely it provides a dark and intimate setting tuesday is date night the price includes an appetizer pizza dessert and a bottle of wine perfect we have tried both the brassecre pizza and the barberini pizza both are wonderful but the barberini had many complex flavors that made it quite special it is very saucy but the honey and creamy cheese add layers of smoothness to the spice of the sauce the cheese board is a great starter with a bottle of wine the sticky ginger cake is literally the best dessert i have ever had in addition the music is perfectly suited to the atmosphere featuring billie holiday and french songstresses yes you have to wait for a table but it is more than worth it it may even be part of what makes the experience special
  service is usually good their salads are my favorite nice to come here if you want a quiet lunch or dinner
  the food was great the service not so much my family and i checked out serendipity for lunch on sunday morning it was pretty crowded when we arrived around 10 am so we were told we would have to wait for 20 30 minutes i really liked how the hostess was using an ipad that would message my iphone when our table was ready you are given the option of sitting inside or out but we wanted inside because it was getting really hot outside already thankfully we only had to wait 10 or so minutes before i received a text saying our table was ready when we sat down our table was pretty wet since they just cleaned it we ordered really quickly since we had looked at the menu while we were waiting and we figured it shouldn t take that long to get our food unfortunately we waited 30 40 minutes for our breakfast ___ i was getting really hungry since we were seeing all the people around us receive food and we weren t getting squat finally our food came over and we were amazed by how big the portions were my pancakes were ginormous my mom s steak sandwich was an entire baguette and my boyfriend s waffles were the size of your head blueberry pancakes super nom they put a good amount of blueberries in there and they don t drown the pancakes in butter like normal places do syrup was great and on the side steak sandwich massive the steak was very good and they add bacon and three fried eggs to the sandwich the bread is an entire baguette aka way too much for one person to finish the potatoes on the side were over seasoned too salty and they burned the first batch so we made them make some more corned beef hash and eggs nom the hash here is super fresh and meaty wow i was jealous of my dad s plate after he gave me a bite of the hash they give you 4 pieces of bread though which was kind of overkill banana cream waffles satisfy your sweet tooth two waffles with bananas cream raspberries blackberries and chocolate sauce not for the faint of heart all in all the food was delicious but our server forgot about us and it s very difficult to get the server s attention since there is so much going on here
  ugh stopped in here before a diamonbacks game and quickly left after a beer it s tiny cramped but not in a fun packed house kind of way and so very dark it was kind of a mood killer they do have a patio but didn t have the misters on and weren t serving out there with all the beautiful weather we get in arizona i hate being cooped up in dark small places
  a really fun place to go hang out and have a few drinks i went last night with some friends and we had a blast it is really cool inside since it is a tiki hut the food was really good i had some potstickers macaroni and chicken wings with plenty to go around and great to share also the sweet potato fries are really good too i would definitely recommend this place
  really fun the show is very entertaining and the musicians are very talented
  good carne asada burrito number 1 chicken is not great
  i came here almost a year ago but never wrote a review this place serves hot fresh food they grow the food on the land behind the restaurant it was so good that i went back multiple times to try different items on the menu it s a bit of a drive from tempe but i think it s worth the drive
  i like this place the steaks are solid the sides are the usual fare the lobster mac n cheese is over hyped but not horrible 38 the service is also pretty solid depending upon how busy they are i like to play at the nugget so its pretty convenient the mood is dark and old schoolish except for the flat screens over the bar kinda odd but i don t really mind it just don t ever remember seeing it before the lobster tails are from fukushima nuclear plant i have never seen them so big serious 3 eye action there all and all pretty solid but not the best
  i ve been going to florencia for a few years now and overall i really like it i m from the east coast so i find it difficult to find really good pizza here i think the quality is great and the atmosphere is pretty cool too the owner not sure who it is staff s it with mostly local high school kids which i find great he or she is helping employ locals overall i like this one a lot
  are you kidding me the best food ever i don t even write reviews but i had to stop midway thru my meal to do it this is too yummy for the price the atmosphere the service five stars hands down wish i lived closer or there was another bravo by my house
  i swear to god one of these days yelp will give us the option for half stars until then it s going to be three for me whereas it would ve been 3 5 i like cooper s really i do the food is pretty solid and so is the beer selection the problem well it s overpriced a lot of their beers run 5 and while that s a bargain price in dc or ny this is madison and i don t expect to pay that much even their specialty selection which usually has a sour or two is way too much the selection is good overall but if i want to really go all out i ll head over to maduro or out east to the malthouse now the food well as with most food fight places it s hit or miss stealthily delicious hummus platter i think it s beet hummus but not sure so so sliders and so so poutine pronounced putin believe it or not cooper s has a really cool atmosphere but the meh quality of the food and pricey beer list is keeping me from giving it more than 3 stars would i hang out there absolutely as long as i didn t plan on drinking a lot
  the food is great but genesis pronounced heh neh sis for you gringos puts the food to shame tonight she is wearing sassy red lipstick that is to die for omg best bartender ever ask her for a tres amigos y gordo next time you re in she won t make it for you but she ll most likely flash you that bajillion watt smile of hers a worthy consolation prize indeed
  visited scottsdale and stopped in on the way from the airport to our hotel for a bite to eat we sat outside which was great the prickly pear margarita is just what i had a taste for and the chicken tacos were fantastic will definitely stop in here again
  red oak is a great spot if you are looking for a change in the food that is typically served in oakland red oak avoids the greasy persona of the surrounding venues and offers a tasteful spin on more nutritious entrees the restaurant offers daily specials which i am quite a fan of red oak is very vegan and vegetarian friendly red oak also offers a wide selection of sandwiches and wraps however given the scarcity of food that is tasteful healthful and served in a creative fashion i reccomend ordering the specials here
  i really don t know how these guys have 5 stars on yelp i went expecting this place to be amazing but was pretty dissapointed the portions were small for the price the food came very slowly even though there were only 3 4 parties there to be fair the servers were all very nice and friendly but i wouldnt go here if you re in a rush to be anywhere since i can t imagine how slow it would be on a busy night
  really awesome tacos the al pastor is my 1 i get some bad cravings for this food and i m not ashamed to admit it the guy running the register is super nice and funny
  just had the q at the midwood outstanding as it was my first time i went with the combo platter to sample various meats ribs pork brisket and sausage were my choices all were terrific sauces were good but nothing special the pickled onions were unusual but the perfect change up between the meats mac and cheese was exceptional i m stuffed i went early 5 00 pm on a saturday after reading how packed it gets glad i did by the time i left a hour and change later it was jammed sat at the bar and had terrific service from chad the bartender thanks chad bottom line i ll be back as often as i can
  excellent outstanding selection of great food coupled with attentive and energetic service highly recommend
  seriously the best red velvet cake in montreal red velvet cake is a southern specialty and not very well known in montreal it was a very popular cake in the 1950s this is exactly the sort of cake you d imagine elizabeth taylor indulging on in cat on a hot tin roof red velvet cake has only become popular in recent years due to 2 reasons jessica simpson and sex and the city which kicked off the whole magnolia bakery craze and cupcake craze it s not the real mccoy with 2 layers cream cheese icing and crushed pecans on the side but it ll do their other cakes like white black forest and strawberry cheesecake are great in fact they are a bakery also so you can order the cakes here as well a great spot to come with a friend and chat over cake and coffee or spend some time before or after a film at the amc service is kind of spotty and slow at times
  my husband and i have been going to fukuda now for 3 years every time we stop in for dinner it is amazing the chefs who prepare the sushi are so friendly and always make us feel like we are their 1 customer the owner always comes over to us and greets us the sushi is beyond delicious and always fresh fukuda has great specials daily and now they offer all you can eat sushi they don t fluff the rolls with extra rice and cucumbers like other all you can eat sushi restaurants tend to do we have never tried the any other menu options that they offer because we love the sushi i wouldn t go any where else in town for sushi we love fukuda
  tucked in the corner of a strip mall the misses and i finally found a worthy sushi bar on our side of town inside was very nice and clean we both enjoyed the modern appeal of the decor the misses mentioned that they had remodeled now on to the food the rolls were different than what i ve had at other sushi bars but to be honest i enjoyed that we both ordered the ayce which by the way includes 5 pieces of sashimi haven t been to a place that includes that with your ayce we started out with the tracy ii which was pretty good i kind of lost track of the rolls after that point oh i did enjoy the texture of the lisa lisa ended with the sasa and alex s munchie rolls both were delicious the staff were extremely nice and one of the waiters even asked us if this was out first time here he was very informative about the menu the chefs were also great i believe it was nick and i m guessing mark he made a couple of out of the box rolls for us they were both friendly and fun overall experience was great and i know we will be back thanks sasa suhi
  visiting from out of town and wanted a good vegan experience being from co we have excellent vegetarian vegan fare so my expectations were high we got the spicy edamame big wac and calexico burgers great flavor friendly service quick with the food order and arrival amazing experience w
  two weeks now having trouble getting the quality out of the kitchen my requests are being ignored this may have been my last trip here
  i ve probably ate at 50 pizza joints in my life so far and jessies is in my top 4 everything is great the knots the pizza is awesome thin chewy crust with thick cheese by the way their large 16 is bigger than a normal pizza places large 14 and you get your money s worth i try to order it once a week i just wish they could be open 24 7 aha trust me you have to try this
  in vegas and we were looking for a quick bite to eat decided to have fast food but wanted something new so we decided to drop by raising cane s chicken fingers and i ended up loving it so good so affordable and so fast the chicken fingers were so tender and it did not appear greasy whatsoever i ve been here a couple of times after the first time and my usual order is now the combo box which i share with my husband comes with four pieces of chicken fingers fries coleslaw texas toast one cane s sauce and a regular drink priced around 7 the combination of chicken slaw fries and toast together satisfies me in all ways the texas toast is by far the best toast i have ever had really the outer part of the bread is golden and crispy but once you pass that outer layer the middle part of the bread is so soft and just literally melts in your mouth love it
  for once i cannot say one bad thing about this place there skirt steak tacos are to die for and there margaritas are amazing nothing artificial is in these things just fresh squeezed juices and tequila this place is a bit upscale and pricey but well worth it
  actually a pretty good place owner is always there and very nice food is good and reasonably priced try the pistachio ice cream it s sooo good
  this is the best place for a full barbeque meal in champaign county li l porgy s has the best sauce black dog takes cake for the best pulled pork sandwich but hickory river cooks the best meal this is texas barbeque here beef brisket is king of all the bbq joints in town hickory river has the most side dishes and the biggest portions the sauce is incredible and the cafeteria design means you don t have to worry about tipping perfect some of the best bbq this bbq connoisseur has ever had
  came here because the rating was 4 and it did not disappoint delicious tacos tried the al pastor and friendly staff will definitely come again
  their chicken parmigiana was some of the best i have ever had in scottsdale and phoenix the waiters giovanni and eddy have been there about 20 years i am amazed to see them every time i go in the red sauce is definitely homemade and the owner is usually in the kitchen cooking i have also had their fresh fish of the day and cioppino it was better than what many of the local fish restaurants make the wine menu and drinks are priced at a good value i wish they had better cappuccino and espresso i noticed that they use a cheap home unit to make this and it definitely does not taste good the tiramisu and cheesecake are made in house and have great flavor i will be back next week
  quick one great place beautiful decor and vibe there were two of us for late dinner jessie was really cute and a great server eli one of the management crew came over to chat and was very kind this place is asian fusion tapas probably a little less mexican than they say innovate menu with smallish portions but priced like it strong flavors they re not afraid to go sour i had a couple of very thoughtfully put together cocktails there s a big drink menu and they have the mixology figured out
  first off the ambiance of the restaurant was extremely comforting and inviting it was definitely not what i expected in that location i believe that the location was previously an eat n park restaurant so this place is definitely an upgrade i was really impressed with the decor however that being said i thought that for the price of the food and the surroundings my overall impression of the restaurant was just okay here s my assessment of the food salsas decent for a dollar you couldn t complain however these are usually free in most restaurants antojitos wings okay barely seasoned queso stuffed pepper fire breathing sweat inducing tongue blazing hot and not much else puffed hominy tasty chicharones meh had them in miami at el palacio de los jugos and there is absolutely positively no comparison like comparing a ford pinto to a rolls royce the chefs at verde need to take a trip southward pollo tacos barely any flavor and for almost 5 per taco i can whip up better in my kitchen and have sides overall the rug didn t match the curtains in my opinion
  becareful of this drive through location they could care less if the order is accurate my order this morning was short by two yes two b burritos sadly this is normal and why i cointinue to visist this location and use it s drive through is beyound me i have written to the coproate office as the reviews for this store are horrible maybe it s time to shut this place down and put in a burger king
  i love the raseberry mouse and canollis every thing looks so yummy i am one about presentation the staff are friendly and helpful if you have a sweet tooth for some yummy desserts then i recomend you come to manan bakery
  trevi would not be a destination restaurant in vegas nor would it be my first choice for a business dinner which is the occasion that we were there trevi is situated in the the forum shops with majority of its seating in the mall the inside of the restaurant is very nice and comfortable with its high ceilings open kitchen and dark colors sitting in the restaurant rather than the patio is highly recommended the dinning room keeps all the mall noise out and it feels more like a restaurant rather than apart of a mall food court the service was great at first with prompt delivery of menus drinks bread and appetizers after the appetizers were served service became nonexistent after receiving the bill it turned out that the gratuity was already added it was then obvious as to why our server began focusing his efforts on smaller tables weather he sucked or not he was still getting his tip the food was not great or bad it was just something to cure your hunger we started out with the bread that they serve to each table and it really served no purpose but to fill your stomach with its complete lack of flavor for appetizer we shared a couple of pizzas that were the best part of the meal despite the canned tomatoes on the margarita pizza they were very good for dinner i ordered the bolognese pasta the pasta was cooked perfectly but the taste reminded me of olive garden we all shared dessert the tiramisu the hot molten chocolate cake and the ice cream were the highlight of the meal with the chocolate cake being the best of the three overall the food was bland unexciting really nothing special the food is on the same level of olive garden but the price is on the level of finer dinning if you re thinking of trevi for dinner keep walking and go to spago instead
  kazu is a montral classic and a downtown staple you can easily identify it on saint catherine by the long line in front of it even on cold winter days the food is original the prices are affordable and the environment is warm and always packed my absolute favourite dish is the chicken burger it must be one of the most important human inventions after fire which is necessary for grilling burgers
  in general i love bbq i grew up with a mom who raked snow and ice off the grill to bbq in the winter i tried a few bbq places when i first moved here but i gave up on bbq in phoenix shortly after moving here and i didn t eat bbq unless i cooked it unfortunately for all bbq places in phoenix past present and future as far as i am concerned there is lmbbq i try not to use another business name in my reviews and then there are all other bbq places in phoenix i stopped here on a whim to give this place a second try 2 years after the first time i was underwhelmed by the food that i tried i ordered the po boy sandwich a mountain of meat sausage brisket chef s choice and pulled pork the meat was far too saucy for me i do not care for sauce on my bbq i prefer the sauce as a garnish on the side i think it was added to the sandwich and i wish i had been asked the sauce wasn t very tasty itself the brisket was tender and juicy but it lacked a deep smokey flavor that i enjoy same for the brisket the sausage on my sandwich didn t taste fresh so i didn t eat it more than a bite or two rather unfortunate because i bet normally the regular sausage is good the only bright spot was the jalapeno sausage i ordered on the side that it just occurred to me didn t taste like it was spiced with jalapeno but black pepper nevertheless the sausage was not greasy and it tasted pretty good i really would like to see bbq places in and around phoenix win but this place is didn t satisfy my taste buds for phoenix i suppose it meets some folks needs for me its a do not return unless lmbbq burns down return factor 1
  beautiful restaurant adjacent to the palazzo the staff was excellent very accommodating without being overbearing we were served very good bread after being seated the wine list prices are double take inducing as it turned out the mark up on the excellent bottle of amarone that we ordered was under 100 so batali and the boys made a decision to showcase kick ass wines without being as rapacious as you might think wines by the glass would be a very reasonable alternative approach we started with the prosciutto which was excellent it literally melted in your mouth if you order this ask for the teeny little rolls that they serve you wrap a slice of prosciutto around a little roll and eat the combination we also had the duck egg with pastrami which was ok we each ordered the special dry aged steak which was aged a lot longer than their usual protocol the dry aging lends the meat a deep funky undertone that is an additional flavor usually missing from meat that said i m not sure how much it really adds we had some excellent mushrooms as a side dish truffle shavings couldn t rescue potatoes au gratin from mediocrity the only real negative to this place is the prices this is a really expensive steak house significantly more expensive than what i am used to in manhattan so there will be a lot of sticker shock i m not sure how the prices here compare to other las vegas steak houses so this may be the price of admission in this town for great steak and wine if you don t have a yolo attitude skip this place because it s a excellent restaurant but not a great value if you can get past the prices it s a very nice meal
  i was here a little while ago and absolutely love it i was at the downtown asu campus and wanted something to eat close by and randomly chose hob nobs the veggie sandwich i had there was great and the bread was delicious they even have gluten free pizza which is awesome it was a very inviting and comfortable place that i would and have recommend people to
  i agree with the other reviewers the service is subpar and i sat at the bar the beers are good but the board of beers on the wall is lacking in details i want to know when doing a tasting the restaurant also feels kind of empty i know their going with a minimalist theme but it s a little over the top
  not the healthiest menu but our server was really friendly and energetic we went for dessert and had some delicious slices of cake german chocolate and caramel
  charlotte needs more places like this tried it first because of a groupon deal but now i m a regular customer very friendly staff good service and consistency i have only had the hamburgers so i cannot give a review of the hotdogs or other food i always try to tell myself i m gonna get something different next time but just can t help going with the chubz double deluxe
  at kaya it s more like a happy happy happy hour with strong tasty drinks and delicious munchies i m a big fan of the frozen mango mojito and the grapefruit basil margarita soooo yummy during happy hour with 1 2 off drinks it s a pretty awesome deal their spicy bean dip is also pretty delicious the first time i came to kaya the chips that came with the dip were a little too hard but the second time i came back they had the kinks worked out and the chips were perfect thanks rachel c for recommending this place
  this was my 2nd visit to savoy went here on a groupon simply amazing place with delicious food i really appreciate how the owner was able to renovate an old building in the strip district into this beautiful restaurant and club lounge the menu is definitely a little pricey but it s really worth it in my opinion especially for special occasions and date nights if money wasn t an issue i would eat here at least once a month environment i m a sucker for restaurants with modern atmospheres and savoy doesn t disappoint in this regard as soon as you walk in the vibe is just awesome the mood lighting is just right too a live jazz band was playing on the main floor which added to this however we eventually were seated downstairs in what they call the owner s room which is a small room with about 6 tables in it and a flat screen tv this came off a little cheesy to me and i felt a bit separated from the rest of the patrons but this is just a personal peeve of mine for the full savoy experience i recommend asking to be seated on the main floor and not in the basement food as for the food i ordered the lamb chops which at 38 is the most expensive entree on the menu but i had a groupon that allowed me to order whatever i wanted so why not the size of the chops are very generous and they are served over risotto it was unbelievably delicious for dessert my wife and i had salted caramel chocolate cake with banana ice cream i hope i wrote that correctly it was amazing and they give you such a generous amount i could hardly finish it i can t wait i go back here again
  i d say 3 5 decent food restaurant atmosphere is simple
  definitely sad to see sole no longer occupying this spot best tres leches of all time but definitely wanted to give italian pie a shot we ordered a small pizza and a calzone the pizza was really good the calzone was just so so beer specials were good decent price but they didn t have feature any italian beers which was a little disappointing the decor honestly is a step backward from what it was with sole and frankly that hurt my overall scoring i would definitely go to this place if you live close enough for a pizza run the pie was good
  when i walked in the woman was on her cell phone texting and it took about a minute before she noticed me she was nice once she saw me but then the phone rang another worker answered and it was a personal call so while chit chatting on the phone she proceeds to slowly grab my pizza out of the oven it was rather annoying but lets get to the food medium supreme i loved the dough it had a sweetness to it but not a ton of cheese also had an order of medium wings yuuummmyyy ill return maybe try a stromboli next time
  wow what a letdown i sat at the bar completely overlooked by the bartenders who by the way apologized twice but continued to take orders from patrons who arrived after me and were literally standing behind me maybe they were friends or regulars who knows but whatever the reason they got priority service three other people who were hanging out with us finally left sans drink they took off for don t tell mama and reported back that they were served immediately jessica c and i decided to suffer through the wait with our parched palates and carry on it was a poor decision and we should have left with the other three the bartenders were busy park was busy that is a fact but not an excuse if you can t execute under pressure you are in the wrong business they get 2 stars for the beer selection and garden but that doesn t matter yuck
  as far as restaurant reviews i go i m pretty easy going i hardly ever rate less than a 3 but this restaurant probably deserves a one the only thing keeping it from a one is the fact that it was clean we called for a reservation in which we were told that they didn t take reservations for two when we got there tons of spacious 4 seater tables were available but they stuck us back in a two seater wedged literally a food between two other tables when we asked to be moved they indicated that they had a lot of four person reservations but if the tables were open after a few minutes we could move we were never offered those other tables which stayed open the entire 90 minutes we were there then when the couple next to us left we asked again to move one table over they indicated that it was reserved and we could not move again two people were seated at the table not sure how that happened since they said policy indicated that they didn t take two person reservations so if seating doesn t bother you and you ve rolled your eyes and skipped over the top section let me discuss the below par food we ordered the chicken cordon blue let s just say that if i closed my eyes and took a bite of chicken mcnugget and one of arrivederci s chicken cordon blue bites i would not know which was which my vegetables that accompanied my dish were mostly just a pile of red onions to top it off my famous crab cake was more mayonnaise than anything else however my husband enjoyed his stuffed shells the experience and food we got was not worth the 70 dollars we paid and i will never come back here again
  so after reading a lot of positive reviews we decided to try this place decor looked nice and casual the server named alex showed us the drink menu and we decided to try the bellini 12 it was just a champagne glass of red colored champagne for the entree we ordered the dry aged ribeye and the seafood chopped salad the ribeye was over cooked dry and served on a cold plate no way the meat is worth 50 so we sent it back alex suggested we should try the regular ribeye instead so we did but it wasn t much better the salad was very small smaller than a typical half salad we do not recommend this restaurant
  i lived in madison for a year before moving to ny a few months back this is by some distance my favorite restaurant in madison and madison food scene is no push over the baked goat cheese and the scallops are particularly memorable my wife who is vegetarian found the food excellent particularly the truffle fries and bruschetta the wine flights here are famous of course but the cocktails were a pleasant surprise too
  they don t have they re act together service is very slow food is not bad hoping to see some improvements
  open late and a nice place to just chill by the window overlooking from a second floor from the street and enjoy a great cup of tea and a biscotti i came in here after strolling around near my hotel and wanting to relax but not stay in my hotel room doing so the service is extraordinarily friendly and kind the biscottis are gigantic and they heat them up before they bring them to you i got the pistachio one and it was ok too much white chocolate which i have taken a liking to recently but was wanting something more nutty it s not to say it was bad but just not what i was craving for the moment they also have a cappuccino one and a double chocolate one that both looked yummy if you re itching for a chocolate fix the seats are comfortable and i spent around an hour here through about 11 30pm it s not loud even though they have tvs on with it turned to the sports channel it s mostly people who are on their own studying or working it s close enough to mcgill university too and nice that it s open late for being in the downtown area i think midnight
  it s like chipotle but i don t know which one came first well that doesn t matter and the only important thing is the food is good they do have more choices than a chipotle and 2 items that come to mind are quesadillas and nachos if you like assembly line burritos give it a try
  a must try if you re in the area the flavors are rich unlike other places where it might taste watered down good little space for hanging out with friends as well
  went there for a bday party it was a great new experience to sit at the pour your own tap table check it out is was different and great you wont find anything else like it in town
  absolutely gorgeous interior with a southern plantation feel i love a menu that accommodates foodie adventurers and more conservative eaters seafood options ridiculously delicious looking burgers that are practical to eat not so big around that a normal sized person can t bite into it and decent salad options for someone trying to eat relatively light that being said anyone who goes to the henry and doesn t get the truffle oil fries is missing the boat i m actually dreaming about them as i write this for the folks who prefer to drink their calories no shortage of options here either great cocktail menu wide selection of carefully chosen beers and a wide selection of wines this place is the perfect happy hour spot bonus the interior is acoustically pleasing as well no straining to hear the person across the table from you it was so inviting for conversation that we actually met and shared an appetizer with the two wonderfully witty gentlemen that sat down next to us nice
  i ve passed this restaurant for a few times now and didn t want to risk wasting a thai food meal when lotus of siam and komol are in the same plaza since we didn t want to wait we decided to give this restaurant a try when entering it has a quiet atmosphere it was not half filled with excellent modern decorations and very clean as others have mentioned the prices here are higher when compare to komol the presentations of the dishes are hands down beat both lotusofsiam and komol i had a tom yum soup with shrimp and it was the best tasting tom yum soup i have had their spicy mint with ground pork was a bit on the sweet side and not spicy enough this dish was just alright for me their steam rice was a bit on the wet side i would definitely come back to get the tom yum soup again and will try another entree i would rate this place a 3 5 since i wasn t impressed with the spicy mint
  good food worth a try
  the customer sevice and ambiance here are always great the managers have always taken care of any issue we ve ever had the prime rib is really really good so is the steak au poivre that said i have to admit that the rest of the food can be pretty hit and miss i ve never had awful food here but several disappointments the managers and staff are so polite and work so hard to make things right that we keep coming back the pricing is a bit high for the inconsistent quality but well worth the early bird and happy hour pricing
  although sardine has been one of my favorite madison restaurants since they opened i thought i would write a quick review on my recent dinner there i suggested sardine for our board of directors dinner on a recent wednesday night and it was a unanimous hit we had a table of 12 many of whom were from out of town and or had never been to sardine it was much busier than i would have expected for mid week but the atmosphere was wonderful not too loud to have a conversation but lively the staff at sardine are some of the best in madison and they lived up to that on this evening every person at our table raved about their meal and i never heard a single complaint or concern only positive feedback since john and phillip opened marigold kitchen more than ten years ago they have set a new standard for dining in madison and sardine continues to set the bar the greatest test of any restaurant for me is to have the confidence to bring a diverse group of people out for dinner and feel confident that whatever their taste they will enjoy their meal sardine passed the test with flying colors on this evening and i will continue to count on sardine as one of my reliable go to restaurants for any occasion
  best little mexican place in phoenix the chimis and burros and everything i have ever eaten here is amazing it s in the back of a house in the hood and is worth the trip if you re going for lunch getthere before noon to avoid the line that stretches through the neighborhood
  8 01 08 i would say h to the e to the double l to the no taste like wanna be asian food several types of choices from thai cuisine to chinese type of cuisines the sauces are very uggghhhh not that great at all there was 7 of us and i believe only one of us enjoyed their food which was a noodle soup dish i would not go here again the only thing i liked was their decor very unique but food wise be aware its yucky and it cost more than it should have been be aware of bad food
  eh i almost want to give this a 1 star the only thing preventing the downgrade is the fact that it was warm out and i wanted a cold margarita and they delivered and it was half price if i had to pay full price for that margarita and for my fajita wrap that was mainly lettuce and bland chedder cheese i d have gone with the 1 star for sure i went here with a group of women if it wasn t a work event i wouldn t have even gone i heard miserable things about this place and i should have listened save your money go to a local independent mexican restaurant skip this adventure for better more flavorful and adventurous dishes if i wanted crappy mexican southwest food i d have gone to chili s
  finally went my mother was craving a chili dog while we were out one day so we decided to go for lunch i wish that i enjoyed it as much as most other people seem to food wasn t what i thought that it would be i thought that the hot dogs were okay nothing special and not worth the price i ve had better from the grocery store and cooked on the grill at home my mother didn t like the chili and i didn t care for the sauerkraut that i had on my bratwurst the onion rings were decent though the decor is cute and makes you feel like you ve been pulled back in time and out east now this is where the big problem starts the service is just horrible i encountered four different people working there and only one smiled another asked me what i wanted and then snapped at me for ordering incorrectly like i know how you re supposed to order at a place that i ve never been to and the last girl was breaking all kinds of health code violations seeing her play with her hair and drinking her personal drinks with her gloves on and then touching food disgusted me maybe that played a role in why i didn t think the food tasted that great because of the people who were handling it i threw out most of my food honestly i m usually willing to give a place a second chance if i have an off first visit but i honestly don t ever see myself going back to ted s gross
  i moved recently to pittsburgh and i m a huge fan of the iskander i tried one the downtown and it wasn t good i saw this restaurant in yelp and i thought i ll give it a try the iskander and the kunafa is the bomb you really should try them both absolutely coming back
  not my type of crowd by the time we got our food their were salt shakers being throw from another table getting into a argument not us patrick the server was of his a game but that s about it
  great service and great italian food we are so happy to have found this place the mussels in white sauce are awesome the bottle of capezzana red blend was a great suggestion for our meal we felt right at home thanks to the owner and servers and we will be back soon to sample the other menu options
  i have been here multiple times and although the happy hour menu is great with multiple drink and food items the service during happy hour can be very slow it took approximately 15 20 minutes before our waitress came to ask us our order i do not know if she was on break and no one was covering her tables or if she just was not paying attention the manager at the time did allow our group to move tables around to fit our large group together which was very nice despite the slow service i will of course be back especially to try more of the new food and drink options for happy hour
  it s no wonder this place is always crowded i love the food here great place to come for breakfast on the weekends if you don t wanna wait for a table come early
  i live around the corner and have been here a few times went on a wed night around 7pm it was a bit of a senior citizens convention i guess it is the over 50 hot spot that said the food is very tasty we had a nice booth comfy and quiet enough to have a conversation but loud enough to provide privacy we started with the spinach dip it was not your average dip typically they are very creamy this had a bit more texture i found it really tasty it was not my wifes favorite so i filled up on it i had the bacon cheeseburger entre and after the spinach dip i was to full to finish half the onion strings were tasty and the burger was cooked well my favorite was the double decker cheesecake chocolate and vanilla with chocolate and raspberry sauce it was awesome def my favorite part of the meal
  being from around detroit i can never get enough of these hot dogs they are amazing it s like being home again i will never come to las vegas without coming here to eat one of these or two or three love how it s in old vegas and they taste the same as they do back home
  been there twice i remembered liking the food but the second visit i had the breakfast burrito and coffee their espresso machine was broken that day i left with a stomach ache the coffee was terrible and the burrito was yuck if you go stick to the standards but in my opinion not worth the wait
  lovely views and great music and dancing the food was so so prices are good at happy hour
  great dilworth south end spot whether you grab a spot inside of out it is a fun place to be for lunch or dinner the bbq is great as are the sauces and sides portions are huge too don t be embarrassed for going with the little pig great beer selection and you can even get a 24oz sammy smith for 4 bucks got a few big plasmas to watch the game too a must for anyone in charlotte for any length of time
  pretty laid back place i don t eat burger but my partner does so we went to this place by the outlet mall and their smash fries are outstanding they actually taste like chips the hamburger meat doesn t come out of a freezer and you can taste it yes i had to have a bite the only thing it s a little pricy specially when you have to basically wait your own food there s only one cashier and you pick up your order from a window that s connected to the main kitchen
  the only good thing about this place was the mangolian grill food and service were just okay got ripped off on the travelzoo offer the offer said it was a discounted price so we purchased it same offer was at the door lame will never go back and will never recommend this place to anyone there are better buffets in vegas
  i personally love eating at authentic foreign restaurants mediterranean food has become my new favorite last month i was on a japanese cake eating ramen noodles anywhere i can find this month i am all over mediterranean food this is my second time visiting this restaurant and both times i ve been highly impressed by the quality of the food and the amazing flavors not to forget the staff who are friendly attentive and accommodating
  vacation bias alert so i was in vegas with some friends and we were craving dim sum we hopped in a taxi to the gold coast not the golden nugget thank you to my fellow yelpers for the correction quality seemed good to me maybe i was being biased because i was on vacation but i ve eaten enough dim sum over the years to be happy with this place
  great salad bar with the option to self pay they probably lose money with hungry salad bar patrons and the quality of items they have available cajun mix hummus fruit salad are some of the notable items i always get the salad bar but i also like getting the excellent southwest chicken chili the club is great too never had anything i didn t love here
  we now have the real deal for great italian food right in our backyard of las sendas yippeee
  i was so sad the day my mom texted me and told me fusion closed i live in tucson and every time i came up to scottsdale fusion was a mandatory stop they had the best beef tataki
  absolutely phenomenal establishment all seven of us were extremely impressed by both the food and service i got the special filet with vegetables and it was the 2nd or 3rd best piece of beef i ve ever had another had lamb and claimed it was spectacular the bread and butter were even extraordinary wine list was impressive only thing is sinatra theme really wasn t that strong just a couple of pictures on the walls really business casual dress although some in other parties wore jeans with nice shirts i d sell my children for medical experiments to eat here again
  service was fast and food was great good bbq flavor and sizable portions full bar with a nice row of tap atmosphere was casual and easy
  it was an interesting evening it does have great ambience bartenders ladies were not very friendly they did their job not saying they were bad just not fun when you normally visit a place food was good a bit pricey happy hour wine was priced very well introduced myself as a concierge and believe me we can or not send a lot of people to restaurant venues and manager could have cared less it was an ok evening but not at the top of my list we were at flemings on monday and it was a lot nicer
  went to mortons for my birthday great place if you like to eat red meat which i dont i had the lamb chops and veggies food was excellent price was a little on the high side the whole food presentation and service really didn t justify anything for me although it is really nice inside and the valet service was a bonus
  one of the best restaurants in pittsburgh came here with a colleague for dinner and sat at the bar ordered a number of courses and all the food was delicious i also have to say from the host hostess to the bartenders to the servers everyone went out of their way to provide exceptional service hands down one of the best dining experiences in pittsburgh i will definitely be back often
  located at the citycenter crystals shopping complex cucina by wolfgang puck caters to your drinking and food needs when i arrived i wanted to cry i had myvegas loyalty points i could have used up here got the white wine sangria it turned out to be the best drink i had all vacation it has fruit slices it brings white wine and makes it sweet omg it tastes really good and it still has the alcohol taste in there i think it was during happy hour so i got a dollar or two knocked off its price i don t think i would have enjoyed the red wine sangria as much though friendly service and friendly bar service as well d
  great beers and ambiance we had such high hopes for the food after reading the menu but were disappointed we ordered the mussels and clams in the white wine broth not quite sure if there was any white wine in there it tasted like the lipton onion soup and nothing more the liberty fondue was okay the balsamic vinaigrette drizzle was a nice touch but the cheese was just warm and hardening the presentation for chopped salad was terrific but again it lacked flavor
  food was amazing and the staff was on point they recommended food that was exactly what we were looking for and it all came out in a timely manner i will be back
  i ve been eating here for years off and on i used to live close by and went often the quality of the food started to go down and we stopped going then they changed owners and it s ok to eat there again flamingo palace is just what you d expect from a strip mall chinese restaurant the food is so so and the service is pretty good we really like the hot and sour soup and the flamingo chicken i can say that through the many many times that i ve been to flamingo i ve never had an experience that made me not want to come back
  what a pretty place with a view i took my french born mother here for lunch on friday she enjoyed the crab louie salad with a generous portion of avocado i had the moules mussels appetizer basically with no frites prices were reasonable the juices from the mussels white wine butter italian parsley goodness were sopped up with the bread brought to the table service was great i would love to return for dinner and wine eyeing the foie gras appetizer and the beet salad they also have beef tartare on the menu which always sounds good to me
  the worst did not get what we ordered they charge you drink refills and no restroom in a resteraunt really awful i do not recommend to anyone save your time and money
  incredible we called ahead to order for pick up because we wanted a night in but were feeling too lazy to cook we ordered the meat and cheese pork sage sausage and cheeses with red wine sauce and the peppered steak with stilton and roasted veggies with peppercorn brandy cream sauce oh my gosh so good so good that the next day int he middle of my work day i felt compelled to look them up on yelp and give them a big thumbs up the sausage was amazing a generous amount of fragrant and flavorful sage yum the peppered steak had just the right amount of silton to be utter perfection we were worried about ordering that one because it is easy to overdo it with such a strong cheese but they totally have it down for dessert boyfriend ordered the banoffee pie which he loved i did not like it because it was a lot of graham cracker crust if you like graham cracker crust this pie would be perfect for you the caramel and cream and bananas together were heavenly by far the crown jewel of the meal was my strawberry pavolva it is made in a crisp meringue shell with fresh whipped cream and fruit it was to die for so so good the texture was incredible it is definitely big enough to share but i m not sure you will want to
  i wish you could give half stars i would say a 3 5 i ll start off with the line it was not that long but it took along time for it to move almost 15 minutes for me to get seated but that s because i was a party of one and got to sit at the bar or else i would have been there way longer i didn t expect it to take long since i was seated at 11 45pm on a saturday it was quick to order and get my drink since of course i was sitting right at the bar but it was really long before i got my burger i sat there for almost 45 minutes because i had to meet someone at 12 30pm and i got it right at that time luckily they were running late too so i had time to enjoy my food in the restaurant during the wait though the staff at the bar kept telling me that it will be out any minute and kept saying sorry for the wait which i find nice because they are at least acknowledging that it is taking a fairly long time i thought the food was great i had the hell s kitchen burger and it had a great kick because i like spicy foods it really did satisfy my late night hunger and i was super happy with what i picked and maybe worth the wait but i still felt it was a super long time to get i would say overall what brought up this place to so many stars was the food i felt the service was okay at best but not good by any means
  love the selection of sushi they have very different types than i am used to but also some originals always leave the place full and for a great price always check groupon before you head over they often have a deal
  my east coast savvy friends have raved about shake shack for a while so needless to say i was very excited to try it out upon arriving to vegas this weekend and boy it did not disappoint can t wait to have it again for a friday afternoon in vegas the wait for shake shack was not as busy as one would think but it was still very packed in the seating areas we were in line to order for about 10 minutes and were able to find a table and retrieve our food in about 15 while in line the staffmember was very helpful with familiarizing us with the menu and even playfully invited us to compare the experience with in n out which i will get to later food our party ordered a number of yummy menu items savory 1 shackburger has lettuce tomato and shack sauce and is possibly the most comparable to an in n out cheeseburger the patty is mindblowingly delicious i miss it already 2 smokeshack a unique burger that features shake shack s signature red peppers any burger with bacon gets an a and this is no exception 3 cheese fries crinkle cut fries topped with a special creamy american and cheddar cheese sauce tip ask for bacon and red peppers on top sweet 1 neapolitan shake my love asked for a combination of the strawberry chocolate and vanilla frozen custards and they gladly complied possibly the best neapolitan shake i ve tried 2 blueberry concrete flavor of the week a concrete is a more dense version of the shake think mcflurry s from mcdonald s but 10x better this concrete had blueberries mixed in and it was wonderful 3 highly recommended shack attack concrete by far one of the best chocolate desserts i ve ever ordered this concrete was creamy chocolatey and filled with plenty of delicious mix ins such as sprinkles dark chocolate chunks and chocolate truffle cookie dough the verdict shake shack vs in n out after discussing it with my friends post meal i have decided that the two burger chains do not invite comparison with one another bc they re in entirely different elite leagues sorry if that s not what you want to hear while their menus seem similar and their burgers are similar sizes size their offerings quality and taste are both on another level as a born and raised socal girl my heart will forever love in n out there s nothing like a classic 3 hamburger protein style with animal style fries and a chocolate shake but their desserts do not hold a candle to shake shack s epic frozen treats menu shake shack admittedly has a more extensive menu so their prices do not compare to in n out s affordable menu overall head to shake shack for more menu options and great flavor and taste but if you re looking for simple classic and tasty options for the best value then in n out is the way to go
  opening day and it lived up to the oreganos we know and love great food great service
  le village buffet offers all things french macaroons till monday baguettes galore and seafood heaven this buffet will have you screaming for more i love the seating it s very disney like specifically pirates of the caribbean the restaurant wonderful service they re very friendly hard working and attentive i recommend seating in one of the little rooms just ask your host if you can sit in one they ll usually seat you unless it s completely full for breakfast arrive early i m talking about 9 9 30am on a weekday probably 8 30am on a weekend or a holiday we arrived at 9 50 and got seated by 10 20 and the line just kept building up the crepes are ok they get ya by having them made in front of you but that s where it ends the sausage selection on the other hand is game they have at least 10 different sausages to choose from also you have to try the potatoes and corned beef their breakfast is really really good for dinner arrive early we came by at 6pm on a weekday and there was practically no line the struggle was real we were trying so hard not to over eat because everything was so good i loved the seafood pretty basic and all the desserts also had an arnold palmer which was a really nice touch to our meal overall a fantastic buffet we had the 24 hour pass which was around 60 after tax it basically gives you access to a few buffets and lets you use it up to five times in a 24 hour period since we were staying at planet hollywood we mostly just went to spice market and le village both are really great buffets and a more economical approach to dining in las vegas
  this place is right down the street from us and we were looking for something quick and easy for dinner the owner and staff are super friendly we had our 5 year old with us so they gave her a paper plate to draw on which they later hung up on the wall and the chalkboard table was open so she was entertained with that as well as watching the gentleman behind the window tossing and making the braided crust pizza was delicious as was the beer in the chilled mason jar mugs we ll definitely be back
  we really liked this place a lot we were introduced to it via the culinary food event devoured short leash dogs stood out amongst incredible contenders so that inspired the 22 mile trip for a hot dog we started with the fried pickles they were good and unique but i was satisfied after two or three and there was a big basket for 6 i ordered the oliver with a spicy beer hot dog when i picked it up water literally ran out of it for lets say 20 seconds too late my naan was now soggy clearly no one even attempted to drain the sauerkraut the taste was there and the salad was exceptional partner had the moki that was divinity wrapped up in a naan what a crazy good combo of deliciousness on a spicy dog we would definitely order this puppy again with a salad the chips were boring so we drove 22 miles spent 42 on hot dogs with two delicious tap beers and tip and will do it again the restaurant is darling and funky
  this this is what coffee shops are supposed to look like at least in my opinion i ve never walked into a coffee shop until sunrise and there s shelves of books to read at your pleasure books of all kind non fiction fiction do it yourself educational coffee shops have a staple for being the place to go to become enlightened informed nerdy i was immediately fascinated by this when i was waiting for my nutella frapuccino wait nutella frapuccino oh yes might i add this is a genius coffee with the best of both worlds i don t believe every single item is of an organic and vegan quality obviously creamers and milk aren t of vegan quality but i love their outlook on presenting the best cup of coffee or tea in the most sustainable manner possible i guess when you re already a tree hugger you might get giddy about that but seriously it was more so the allure of the shop itself with its shelves of alluring books that drew me in more than the taste and this isn t saying the taste was bad it was really delicious the tastes of coffee and teas here will appeal to your taste buds different because yes they use quality ingredients that aren t processed or haven t been loaded down with other preservatives or extra sugars like some other yelpers noted it s important to keep an open mind when crossing over from your local starbucks into an organic vegan certified coffee shop
  i can t stay to study here due to their bad internet connection i ve always in need of good connection to search for the references i need for my writing paper but this place is to enjoy a cup of good coffee and to hang out and meet with friends also fresh madison market often gives some coupons at the back of their receipt so yeah don t waste it take it and make use of it and steep brew is one of the stores that actively participates nice of them the barista never gave me a dirty look for any coupon i brought to them and their motto saying we ice anything is one good news for summer
  i got the quesadilla with shrimp and mango unique combination but nonetheless good try it i d recommend this place i was only in glendale for one day because i was interviewing at midwestern university i just decided to stop somewhere for dinner the night before the interview i saw this place and hoped it was good and it was i kinda wanted to try a regular burrito but someone else on yelp said to try the shrimp mango quesadilla so that s what i did the place was kinda empty during dinner time i don t really know what that means but it doesn t seem good
  worse parking ever the place is always way too crowded overpriced for what you get and they need better live music everyone brags about their bbq well when i get it there it always tougher than shoe leather and they take forever to get a drink order
  i love jimmy buffet and i had a blast at the margaritaville in key west but this place is just not worth the headache it is packed all day long and probably seats 1000 people we shared some apps wings were horrible horrible the service was a complete mess sorry jimmy i ll have to wait till i m in key west for another cheeseburger in paradise
  3 star average for my beloved zaba s say it ain t so i had to scan through all the reviews to get myself prepared to battle and defend zaba s honor but you know what i know where most of them are coming from this location just opened in april and even i the most diehard of zaba s fans since i ve been visiting their establishments since i was a unlv student over 15 years ago can admit that i had some shaky experiences here early on i think a few times that month after they opened i literally drove across town to the next nearest zaba s to get my fix i m happy to report that half a year later everything is fine and well now the shredded beef is consistently seasoned to my liking a problem early on and some of the newer staff members then were a little light handed on portions and have since come around to providing more bang for the buck my usual order is a shredded beef salad with corn and green salsa but on the weekends i splurge a little with burritos or tacos and sour cream and cheese and chips okay so i always get chips i find myself not getting the chicken at this location as much as i used to get it at some of the other ones i tend to like it when it gets a nice seasoned char and more often than not here it doesn t look like it has that nice burnt exterior i m a charred chicken connoisseur i ll be honest though i find myself not being upset at the chicken because deep down my heart lies with the shredded beef anyway i like chipotle s barbacoa but find zaba s version usually superior especially when it s seasoned well which as of late it has been then the green salsa here is better than any chipotle offers imo my only 2 disappointments are as follows 1 the chips are tasty but i feel like there s never enough salt on them here finding a salty chip in a bag here sometimes is as difficult as finding meaningful lyrics in a justin bieber song 2 coca cola freestyle people it s 2015 this isn t a thing anymore but i swear every 5 or 6 visits i get someone who stares at it in amazement like it s a portal to narnia or you get someone who has to examine every option of flavor of diet coke zero before settling on regular clearly barqs dr pepper or cherry coke are the only acceptable options anyhow i ve given it praise before but let my close out this review by telling you how much i love the zip program they do here for every 10 entrees you purchase you get a free one the best part is double point sundays so if you make it a point to come in sunday and order say 2 entrees you re 40 of the way to a free entree i come here so much i average a free entree every week and a half another win for the common man
  as you can see by the overall rating on this restaurant you should avoid i have been twice the first time was much better than the first the first time i went with a party of 7 and we sat at a round table had apps dinner and drinks and everything was fine and service was good the second time i made a reservation 3 weeks ahead of time since it was a large party after my graduation my family came from out of town about 20 people when we got there they told us we would be at two separate tables even though when i made the reservation they said that we would all be seated together not only were we separated but instead of connecting two long rectangular tables they had about 15 of us at a long table and my mom and grandma and 3 others at a circular table across the room i was pretty mad about that had i known it wouldve been like that i never would have went anyway the food and service was also awful we had to flag servers down and no one of the twenty people were impressed with their food in fact my dad had to buy food right after we left because he didnt eat anything the whole experience was really disappointing especially when youre paying so much for bad food and service never ever again listen to the reviews and go elsewhere
  so disappointed i ordered a pizza and garlic knots and it is so bad my wife and i couldn t eat it and had to order from a different restaurant the garlic knots were burned to a crisp and the pizza haf practically no toppings while the middle of the pizza was almost raw and stuck to the box we honestly had to rip out little pieces to get it out we will never order from this place again when calling in to let them know what was going on they hung up on me but not before yelling at each other while i could hear everything they said then the person i spoke to when i called back said they couldn t do anything for me and said i would have to wait until an owner came in and that she would have them call me just bad business not sure why they have 5 stars looks like more friends and family ratings
  this local gilbert establishment has never disappointed me over the past five years i have been going there my wife and i will stop there on a weekend afternoon for lunch and always walk away happy i like to try something different whenever i go and always enjoy what i have the staff are always friendly the food is always good and i am supporting a local restaurant it doesn t get much better than that i love the french fries they are seasoned really well the lemonade is homemade and very good yeah flancers p s they opened a second location in north mesa 1902 n higley rd
  im not religious but oh jesus thank you screw this review im going to eat p s dont forget to call ahead and everything on the menu is good
  4 20 cafe makes the best mochas in quite possibly the world they use valrhona chocolate and it s one of the most delicious hot beverages i ve ever had their dishes are pretty well portioned so you don t feel gorged after brunch unless you end up ordering multiple plates to share because you can t decide on what you want to eat i have loved everything i ve tried here i m a huge fan of their biscuits especially with the sausage gravy their yogurt and granola is great the bread for their sandwiches is wonderful i love how they use local ingredients too i was so excited the first time i went here and saw that they were using veggies from butterbean farms the staff is friendly here too the cafe is adorable seating is sometimes difficult but don t be scared to cozy up and share a table with strangers so you can sit down and enjoy your meal this place is one of my favorite brunch spots
  got a seafood pho soup with rice noodles it was tasty but they were really stingy on the meat for the prices they are charging
  brunch is awesome i ve been to corbin s for brunch several times but never for just dinner so my boyfriend and i decided to try it out we had a 10 off one entree from the valpak we went on a wednesday night there was no one eating in the dining area and just a few people at the bar and sitting outside we had ordered our food and a glass of wine and beer well we saw the two tables outside that ordered after us receive their appetizers fine and then their meals where was ours our waiter finally came by and said it was almost ready we ordered the pan fried chicken and salmon which you wouldn t think would take very long well 20 minutes after we were told it was almost done the food finally comes out we waited for at least 45 minutes for our food and the waiter didn t even offer an excuse as to why it took so long the chicken was good but asparagus had no seasonings and the hard ends were not cut off my boyfriend said the salmon and side of veggies had no flavor whatsoever he makes better thank goodness they served it with a lemon we were very disappointed with the wait and the food we will only be back again for brunch i still can t figure out why it took so long and why we weren t given a reason also each dish was 17 not worth the price sorry corbin s but had to share my experience
  this is a great small place and really unbeatable prices if you like to try a bit of everything as other posters here have mentioned they have a vegetarian thali and meat thali for around 9 00 and you get either all vegetarian choices or 2 meat 1 vegetarian option comes with naan rice papadam bread i love their butter chicken and chicken curry but the last few times it was a bit lacking in flavour i think it s just not as consistent but that being said i am rarely disappointed great place for take out and if you aren t looking for a thali special their menu actually has some great options as well i love their chana samosa
  there are some really fun fusion food options like kalbi beef kimchee quesadillas and philly cheesesteak egg rolls you can order a side of bulls balls an alcohol infused shakes like the drunken monkey and pick up strippers at the bar or club right outside the restaurant what more do you need in vegas
  the wings are really good we have ordered them twice now we got the hot option and the sauce is flavorful and just spicy enough to make you sweat a little they use the good size wings and drumsticks not those little wing dings some places like to call wings we have only ordered pizza there once it was okay not the best but certainly better than some of the other places we ve tried around here
  i m not a fan of toby keith or even a cowboy well i m a cfh but thats besides the point this place is tolerable i have gone here a couple times either before or after a movie at the cinemark theatre and the beer was reasonably priced i believe i paid 3 bones for a pint of sierra nevada or some kind of pale ale didn t have any food so can t help anyone out there they atmosphere is relaxed with a huge bar circular bar right in the middle on the west side of the bar is the area where you can sit down at a table or booth and have lunch or dinner i saw a reatil store selling everything toby kieth then over to the east part of the bar there is a stage and a couple of barn looking things with some couches and comfy chairs inside that i lounged on for a couple of minutes they also had a lush looking room behind some glass that looked like it can be used for meetings or private partys even have a mechanical bull but that seems to be the new trend everywhere these days ok so what i didn t like about this place its rather bright in their granted the times i ve been here have been during the daytime the bartender chick acted like she was all that and wasn t really all that also she came off like we were interupting her like it was inconvinience to serve us and do her job lastly all they played was shit kicker music now i know its a country place but it even sounded like it was the same artist every song so i started thinking all the played was toby s music i went up to the hostess and asked her if all they played was toby keith s music she enlightned me that was not true but they played the same playlist over and over again all day long when asked how many times a day would she hear the same song she told me about 8 to 9 times thats almost inhumane torture and felt sad and sorry for those employees i know i wouldn t be able to stomach that day in and day out so overall if you dig country and that kinda lifestyle then you will go ape shit for this place but if you don t its still adaquate
  its a cool spot to go nothing outstanding only been here once since it changed from midtown sundries i ll go again and may update it my review if something review worthy happends
  i ordered before and today we came to eat in and i must say this is now one of my favorite places in ndg it s just a chicken diner but they have the food down and the prices low and the service is just amazing so friendly the whole way through and what seemed like good long term clientele we both had soup breast chicken dinners w coleslaw fries gravy bread and half a litre of red wine and it came to about 38 we loved it will definitely be a go to winter spot
  i like the food here and its my day drinking spot i like the brat with the pretzelbun bar staff are always friendly and take care of us i just dont know why this place is not ever busy i think it is the neighbourhood
  44 for a saturday lunch the prime rib was unbelievable inch thick and juicy every item was fresh so now i m just confused as to why a great buffet was so far off from the strip
  i was very excited to come here as it was my first time i expected a lot especially for the price for burgers the menu is huge that s not a good thing in my opinion it was too overwhelming took us a while to go through it i found it odd we weren t given waters at the beginning doesn t every place usually do that our drinks came out at a decent time though the waiter told us the kitchen was backed up so we asked for fries while we waited for our food never got them okay i ordered my burger medium well it was completely burnt charred i got the a1 peppercorn burger i guess i expected it to taste like the sauce i was wrong i had to take the top bun off to eat it because the bad taste was so strong then the waiter asks my friend who i went with if he needs anything or wants new fries we both got bottomless he never acknowledged me at all seriously i felt like it was sexism in all honesty even my friend pointed out that he was being helped asked questions but not me it took a while to split the check so i wish that would ve been acknowledged from the beginning we should ve spoke up told him the waiter was talking to my friend about how he has been a server for over ten years now so i guess i just expected better service won t be coming back got to cross that off my list
  the only good things i can say about la cave is the service staff and atmosphere the food was not that great the beets with goat cheese was not bad at all but the seafood we tried was sub par the salmon sashimi tostadas was not sashimi but smoked salmon and it tasted funny because it just don t go together with the sauce they serve i wonder if they ran out of sashimi and just put smoked salmon and hoped we wouldn t notice maybe an error in the kitchen i don t know our white sangria was actually wine spritzer with 3 pieces of fresh fruit in it they charge 15 for that come on guys nice crowd nice atmosphere and good vibe good service but the food was just not good they need to try a little harder
  i love pesto s and frequent here often i love that its locally owned quality food and has great decor happy hour is a great deal too my favorite dish is the eggplant rollatini chefs specials are amazing too twice the owner gave me a carnation on my way out great family running this place
  very good skillets the service was also great but could have used an area to wait while we were waiting to be seated a small but comfortable breakfast place
  hanny s is so much fun it s swanky and has its own dj if you re looking for a fun place to go with friends for drinks yummy food and a cool ambiance this is it
  took my wife to over easy for breakfast and what an experience it was our first time and while trying to decide on what to order my wife saw the lady s plate setting next to us and asked her what she had ordered because it looked so delicious low and behold after speaking to lady for several minutes we realized it was one if the owners andrea or andy she was so engaging and a very nice woman my wife ordered the pumpkin french toast with a mediterranean omlet i had the denver omlet and a belgian waffle we also had an order of the blueberry muffins omg everything was so fresh the muffins were so gooey and has so many blueberries yummy the omlets were awesome mine had so many fresh vegetables it was yummy the pumpkin french toast was freshly made and yummy the waffle was good but the maple syrup made them yummy everything was amazing from the fact that the owner was there and took the time to talk with us made us feel welcomed and like part of the family highly recommend it we got there early and the place filled up pretty quick but that should be expected due to the entire experience will definitely go back this place rocks food service hospitality 100 it was yummy
  the worst food food came to table brunt the service was slow even tho the place was empty save your money
  went to the grand opening in summerlin the food service atmosphere was spectacular it s always a treat when you can enjoy great restaurants off the strip the grand opening was a success moving forward it was obvious the next time i will have to make a reservation great job
  old el paso tamales took me back to my mothers homemade tamales highly recommend stopping by and getting your tamale craving filled
  excellent food and great atmosphere the people were awesome and recommended food we never heard of
  this place is unfortunately often overlooked probably due to insufficient marketing the place has a cool pre retro as in forties or fifties feel it s kind of lush or was lush and i can t determine whether the decidedly worn tired feel adds to the appeal of this place to me anyway this is not a bad place to hang out but it wouldn t be the highlight of a night out in downtown phoenix i have to say that we got great attentive service with exactly zero attitude and that is a large part of why i am giving this place four stars you d probably want to start here rather than end up here but all in all ghost lounge will definitely be on my next downtown bar hop
  the prices are awesome the food is delicious i would definitely take a girl here for a date
  my wife and i stopped in on a friday night the parking lot was packed but they also share the lot with a chili s we were told the wait would be about 10 minutes which it was like an earlier review the female servers were in skimpy tight black dresses something like you would see in a chain breastaurant tacky we sat at the bar for our wait and was acknowledged by the bartender right away and were served our drinks quickly some of the wall art reminded me of posters i used to have as a teen in the 80s time to enter this century folks after sitting our server matt was professional as professional can be because this was our first visit he explained to us how the different cuts of meat were prepared and would taste upon seating we were given a fresh roll of bread it had a grainy taste but maybe that was the intent and that was the only roll we ever saw the fried calamari was good as were the dipping sauces i had the new york strip and garlic mashed potatoes the plate also came with a few roasted green beans and red and yellow pepper slices the garlic mashed potatoes were a little thin meaning kind of soupy but tasted well enough surprising for a steak place my serrated knife was dull i switched out my knife with my wife s whose wasn t much sharper i struggled cutting through the sinews of my steak all in all it was good service the food tasted good enough but with the dated wall decor and breastaurant style uniforms the 75 tab for the two of us seems well overpriced
  mama mi what s not to like
  my boyfriend and i really like their happy hour menu they have several vegetarian options which is a nice change we normally get the lettuce wraps gardein wings get the asian sauce not the buffalo sauce and then a few other random things they have an amazing taps selection and you can get really small portions so that you can try a bunch of different types it s got a slight upscale pub feel to it i really like this place i just wish there were a location closer to downtown phoenix
  exquisite they apparently have a limo service that takes you from the hotel to the restaurant another chef s tasting very french very lovely everything from foie and tuna and beef tartare and john dory and caprese and jellyfish and veal and godly bread carts
  i ve seen posts about this place so my husband and i decided to try it out we started off with the octopus ball which was ok for me it wasn t something i d try again but my husband said it was good we wanted to order the salmon sashimi appetizer but the waitress said it was a new item and wasn t sure if they had any bummer my husband and i shared the seafood hot pot and added sliced beef quail eggs and extra cabbage the hot pot was good but i wish they added more flavor to it the waitress also gave us 3 pieces of their chicken meatball which was delicious i thought that was the best part of the meal
  this place is amazing they have the best burgers and the best prices when you eat here a 5 00 burger with fries and a drink cost you exactly that 5 00 the friendliest people work and eat here too fun atmosphere too
  great place for beginners or experts cool place to hang out play and just enjoy time with friends food service though needs work very slow and the food isn t that good
  stopped here for breakfast this morning and was totally satisfied i got the colorado omelet and raspberry pancakes and service was good good for a family breakfast
  i am not a fan of noise too close for comfort seating or tables that are too small to comfortably have drinks and entrees on the table the menu is not for the faint hearted brains pig ears etc the huge pork chop is very good and definitely enough to share as a full entree the waiter knew we wanted to share the pork chop and order other sides didn t offer to have the double pork chop de boned and cut in half in the kitchen not one of my finest culinary moments trying to make into 2 portions on the tiny table do not go there if you have theater tickets we had 5 45 reservations and ran over to the benedum for a 7 30 show there are much quieter better restaurants in the theater district
  this is really a 3 5 in my book the space is pretty big and they have both indoor and outdoor seating they have free wifi and on a saturday morning it is very quiet and a great place to work the morning torque protein shake seriously one of the most delicious things ever if i got to drink one of these every time i worked out i think i would work out way more the cali wrap for breakfast was pretty standard there was a lot of wrap compared to inside goodies
  am not a poutine person everywhere i go they don t do it well but when i was in montreal and saw this poutine place and i heard that montreal has the best poutine so i decide to try it and it was really really really good poutine the best i ve ever had this place is a must either you like poutine or not because they do it in a perfect way and they have a lot of options you can choose from so defiantly you will find something you like in their menu price is perfect portion is more than perfect service is great and friendly
  be prepared to spend a lot of money here the crispy duck salad was good but i m not sure how it s worth 28 service was a bit slow and our server was absent for 15 minutes while we were ready to cash out and leave i like the idea of family style asian fusion and sharing plates so there s one benefit probably won t be back here anytime soon
  pros location for me anyway staying at planet hollywood the waitresses cheerleader uniforms it s a sports bar called blondies i m allowed to be a chauvinist pig some tables had personal beer taps unfortunately i didn t get to take advantage of this menu selection was pretty good a little something for everyone they burnt our first pizza a little definitely still edible but still gave us a 2nd pizza for free cons the burnt our pizza but made up for it i got a wrap that was pretty good but i ve had better value was just meh probably decent for vegas though with all the places to go in vegas blondies is likely not a priority destination but it was good for a weekday lunch and some beers
  disappointed pot roast dry mac cheese is out of a kraft box clam chowder tasteless service awful server not rude she took our order brought our food gave us our chk nothing more even though we sat near a main aisle where she passed ever few mins she never asked how things were how we were doing she didn t even refill our drinks there s a flip menu on the table saying u get a free dessert if a dessert tray isn t brought to u i have never turned down a free offer this time i did i couldn t wait to leave first last visit ever
  nomsss went here for lunch with my whole family they have generous portions got the lunch special that comes with salad miso soup an entree and a roll i had to take things home i was extremely full the ramen is delicious extremely savory and salty though so make sure you enjoy that the rolls are yummy pretty americanized but still good recommend for lunch such a great deal with a great selection however the hostess can definitely work on her friendliness and politeness super super rude
  bleh sorry denny s but i m not a fan the food is awful more times than not so is the service i only came here two times for breakfast because the other nearby restaurants had a wait and i was starving but next time i think i d rather start gnawing on my own arm
  a nice treat not fancy not casual just comfortable food was excellent the appetizer was crab cakes and seafood skewers nice we had caesar prepared chopped and mixed in the dressing lobster ravioli was jammed with lobster covered in black pasta and cream sauce the sole was wonderful served with greens and garlic mashed service was average nothing special when we are in the mood and in the area we will be back we just won t drive across town so good seafood casual atmosphere average service
  we ended up coming here pretty late on evening the service was fast so that was nice when you are hungry but they were not very busy so i don t know if this is normal service for them or not i had the chili rellenos it was ok overall the rice was strange in my opinion as it had carrots it in it came with 2 stuffed peppers i could only eat 1 2 of once since i had a stomach full of frozen drinks my husband had their version of a caesar salad and said it was just ok my mom had a chimichanga and said it was greasy the chips and salsa were good and tasted fresh
  let s not get carried away with these reviews ok this isn t sept iles rein it in a little the coffee is passable the sandwiches snacks are decent and inexpensive staff is friendly beer is cold pool table in back makes it a ok do i hang out here did the desserts change my life no seems home to a lot of misfits which is a good thing as far as i m concerned maybe its the decor the big open feel and those huge windows are pretty nice but it has all of that late 1990s early 2000s boring modern feel that essentially strips it of any character rating scale 1 star avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe 2 star risky at best 3 star i ll try it again or consume here in a pinch 4 star i eat here regularly if financially and calorically feasible 5 star i m comfortable taking other chefs here
  we re on our way back from vegas but i couldn t wait till i got home to review this spot because i can t get over how bad it was we just wanted a place to grab a light lunch because we had had a huge dinner the night before we decided to go with a simple burata caprese with the margherita pizza the burata was good but the tomatoes that came with it were exactly like those canned peeled tomatoes no joke big let down then the pizza came when they first brought it to the table i said i hope it tastes better than it looks lol oh boy well the crust was thin and crispy that part was good but the sauce was i kid you not canned tomato paste soooooo awful i have been to batali s mozza in la as well as his awesome restaurant babbo in nyc so i don t get how batali could put his name on this restaurant for a 50 lunch this place was a complete waste of the money
  my 1st time here we got breakfast burritos they were excellent the place has a good vibe with bookshelves artwork etc
  walked in at about 7 30 were seated immediately but walked out at 7 43 after the group behind us who had just been sat down was being waited on when had not been acknowledged in the least no drink order no i ll be right with you nothing this was after walking into the ladies room and noticing what i believe was a homeless woman in the small restroom with her clothing spread across the baby changing table taking care of her hygiene needs
  my husband and i went on a long hike nearby and yelped for something quick and delicious when we were done i recognized reynas from man vs food so we decided to give it a try we weren t disappointed the frescos and totras were amazing perfect for after hiking we live in seattle and have nothing that compares the servers were so sweet and took great care of us the food was delivered very quickly i can t wait to return and try the ceviches we will definitely be back next time we are in town
  i have been going here since it opened i always say get the fish special the french club the arugula salad or any of the entrees i have never been a fan of the crepes with the exception of the dessert crepe wow banana ice cream and nutella colleen or catherine are my favorites colleen is one of the most talented mixologists on the planet and catherine does service to perfection this is a local place where a lot of neighbors have been going for years it is all about quality and consistency i have only left unhappy once after way too many visits and manhattans the fish and chips used to be the best in charlotte but they changed the fish a while ago and it has never been the same that is my one complaint
  pretty sure i got a free muffin and hot damn was it worth the 2 minute wait it took to get seated muffin was yummers benedict was semi yummers potatoes were yummers af i don t have a picture because the second my food was put in my vicinity my animal instincts came out and i carried out my attack all in all i would have paid for that free muffin just bc it was so dang tasty
  good was great my tummy is very happy staff was slammed so service could be better line out the door before it even opened and through our entire meal days something about the quality
  amazing food and reasonably priced for vegas you can t get better than that had the linguini carbonara and it was truly the best i ve ever had the pasta was perfectly cooked al dente this place is a hidden gem
  my girlfriend and i stopped by here for first friday we sat in the bar area so it was a great people watching spot we ordered a couple appetizers the fish tacos and the sliders i would have liked the sliders better if the bread wasn t so hard however i did like the fish taco platter as i would describe it because the ingredients came separate and you assembled the taco yourself the winner for me though was the dessert recommended by the waiter the donut churros with the chocolate sauce my only complaint would be we were told about a 2 beer special and it being warm i would think it it s the special of the night it would be ready to go cold and i wouldn t have to pour it over ice
  finally made it to hot taco after waiting in anticipation for it to be built after all the waiting i thought it was just okay margaritas were watered down chips were oily but salsa was good and had a kick to it my wife and i each had three different types of tacos with the flour tortillas i thought they were just okay and a little bland but my wife immediately threw all her food up when we got home she got food poisoning almost immediately which is too bad i really wanted to like this place
  updated review i have taken some time to step away after my experience and give what i feel is an honest critical and logical review i am trying to approach this from a logical perspective and remove any brash and quick emotional response joe beef an establishment that is beyond well regarded and coveted by many who enjoy unique dining experiences unfortunately the experience fell short for me it may have been the hype from friends the consistent and raving reviews from well respected critics and perhaps just the level of anticipation that left me looking for more we spent a week in montreal and made the rounds to the cities must do spots i ll be frank my french is beyond poor and i usually outwardly express my lack of the language for 6 nights we didn t face a single issue we were met with respect and were offered either english menus or someone well versed in the english language service is important and joe beef fell short our waiter a tall bald gentleman with forearm tattoos fell short he was quick disingenuous and it appeared he was bothered we did not speak french the menu and wine list was not covered it received a quick check it out and ask if you have any questions this is direct contradiction to the couple sitting at the bar english speaking americans who received a thorough and spirited review of the menu by the bartender i should have spoke up and asked for a new waiter that is my fault i know that these things happen the place can t be perfect all the time i m just disappointed it came on the last night of our stay after a week of nothing but perfect service we made a wine selection from the available wines by glass no complaints and a nice glass the oysters were wonderful a nice selection of west coast and pei varieties our entrees fell short my wife had the leg of lamb overall she enjoyed the dish but it lacked some depth as a dish a slab of meat with simple peas was not what we expected but it was still a decent dish i choose the lobster and spaghetti which is regarded as a classic amongst many reviewers unfortunately i found myself wanting more in the dish the lobster was cooked perfectly as was the pasta but the sauce itself was rather simple and boring i had read in the past this dish was served with a delicate lobster bisque sauce perhaps they changed this up it lacked depth flavor and added very little to the dish as a new england er i eagerly awaited this dish i wanted to see how a new city would handle a classic meal from my home as a dish it was certainly edible but i would never order it again especially at the price of 50 cad update i received a voice mail from the manager of joe beef regarding my experience and poor review here on yelp i appreciate them reaching out i ve yet to decide if i will speak to them regarding the matter unfortunately i am 5 hours from montreal and that would be quite the trip to give it another go if i find myself in montreal again i ll certainly be coming to joe beef again i ll just make sure to have a waitstaff member who delivers what they are supposed to do
  this place was great the food was delicious the service was good i had the taco and gordita with beef asado and loved it
  very good food and atmosphere every meal i ve had has been very good and the service is always quick
  the portions were large and filling and our waiter raul was attentive and fun definitely a nice spot for a local or someone who wanted to get away from the strip
  i was excited to find out this place was here especially because i live nearby and had high expectations unfortunately i was let down when we got there a couple tables were occupied by people already eating a woman and her daughter were in line ahead of us placing their order a man with three young boys was behind us we all placed our order at the counter and grabbed tables to wait for our food to be ready to pick up nobody else came in to order while we were there the woman and her daughter got their food relatively quickly i thought this was a good sign but it was not to be although the three people behind the counter seemed to be scurrying around no food was forthcoming after a long time i saw one of the people place an order of fries presumably mine on a tray under a heat lamp a few minutes later she placed another order of fries on another tray under a different lamp several minutes after that she added several sandwiches to the second tray and then she added a sandwich to the original tray with the fries that had now been sitting there a good ten minutes nothing aggravates me more than seeing my food sit under a heat lamp for an extended period of time at this point my wife went up to the pickup counter to ask what was going on they finally brought out her salad and said they d bring the dressing to the table at this point the only chance the restaurant had of having us as repeat customers was outrageously good food but things fell short my wife s salad was big had plenty of chicken and she said it was very fresh but it wasn t anything out of the ordinary i was expecting something amazing from the chicago beef considering it s the restaurant s specialty but it was just ok maybe we caught them on a bad day maybe they were buried with takeout orders maybe other menu items are outstanding and maybe my expectations were way too high regardless i was disappointed and won t be back
  some friends and i were meeting up for sushi and this place was one of the closest sushi places to their house so we decided to stop by it was fairly busy when we showed up but we were seated right away which was nice half of our party the guys were going to be showing up a little later but we went ahead and ordered some drinks and appetizers to tide us over until they showed up the waitress was nice if somewhat lacking in her knowledge of the menu but we didn t really mind after getting our appetizers and initial drinks we really didn t see our waitress well actually let me rephrase that we saw her at other tables around us just not at ours now i understand that we had told her we were going to wait to order until our party shows up so it s not like we expected her to show up and take our whole order but she wasn t even coming around to fill our water glasses or to check and see if we needed refills once the guys showed up and we ordered the food came out and i was kind of underwhelmed none of it was bad but it was all pretty average the only thing memorable were the panko breaded onion rings which were fantastic honestly i would go just for those babies as for the sushi i may try a different roll and see if that made a difference and i would definitely hope for a server who s a little more attentive
  great tacos after reading all the other reviews we thought we would give this place a try don t judge a book by its cover comes to mind when you see the storefront walking up to it we were at first skeptical that this place would have yummy tacos it looked run down and dark the tequila tacos were great fresh salsa made it pop the guac and chips were good as well freshly made chips and guac the carnitas were good as well
  definitely a unique dining experience and the food and service was very good but i m giving 4 not 5 stars based on a friends dining experience there and we missed out on a lot of cool info regarding some of the food and desserts that our server failed to tell us for example they dropped off a vegetable platter and didn t say anything about it and it turns out the different items were from all over the world would ve been cool to know what was from where
  great food i love the arepas they are all good go get some now seriously right now go eat you ll love them
  right across from my office hella dark in here i guess average looks will be super duper in this dark lit place music is great food is damn good breakfast lunch or dinner waitresses are adorable service is very quick tv s are everywhere you ll love it
  so i ve been wanting to try az 88 for awhile now and this friday this was the spot chosen for double date night yay with all the hype about this place i felt like we were in for a treat but unfortunately we all left wondering what the heck everyone is talking about as far as the restaurant itself it really is a cool place i loved the decor and i heard the bathroom was awesome from the hubs the patio and bar looked very inviting and were packed on a friday night our service was so so i didn t think our waitress was too friendly and it seemed like we were trying to cheer her up somehow it was weird also my husband was served a flat beer but she did replace it which was nice the food itself wasn t anything special i did like my az 88 chicken sandwich but everyone else wasn t impressed with what they got i found the side items that were served with the sandwiches somewhat odd cold veggies fries and some fruit basically i think i would go back just for drinks but being this is a north scottsdale bar they are quite expensive i m pretty sure i ll just save my money for some of the other awesome restaurants in the old town area
  mmmm gyro i know that zorba s isn t authentic greek food i go to chicago for that but for what it is it s excellent the service is always very friendly and speedy and they have a fairly large menu and is inexpensive they also have killians on tap and a fairly large bottle selection zorba s is probably my favorite green street eatery
  visited the brunch buffet the cost was 26 per person and i can t help but think that there must be something better my first impression was a sense of disappointment my first bite was of some sushi and it almost led to vomiting after taking a breather i was able to manage to try some other things nearly every item i tired was cold had it been hotter it all would have been decent the dessert was the only redeeming quality of this buffet i m no vegas pro but i m guessing that one might be able to do better
  cool theme curious to see if this place stays quiet or explodes in popularity it could do either with the whole beatles classic rock niche very excited to see some shows in the cavern their dark and dusty brick basement kind of creepy looking but its an awesome venue to see some music they havnt had any shows yet tried the rigby burger which was ok the meat toppings wasn t hugge by any means but the kaiser roll it was on was the size of a football a little too much bread imo the sides were the highlight in my opinion i don t like super tangy coleslaw and theirs was nice and creamy with a touch of twang overall a cool place with a decent beer selection and cheap solid food its a nice addition to madison s dynamic bar scene ill return to catch a show sometime
  i found my new favorite pho place only 5 min from home no need to go to chinatown highly recommend you all must try it s so great to have a delicious vietnamese place so close to home we will be regulars here no more pho 8 their service has gone to pot tonight i had the pho with egg noodles and roast pork the broth was piping hot tasted great the bbq pork was fantastic
  dismal is the word that comes to mind remodeled the building but obviously forgot to invest any time in training staff
  i really struggle on how many stars to give this place on the one hand there s very very few places to get ramen saimin udon and the like in the phoenix metro area i really appreciate this place as an option on the other hand republic s ramen is merely fine not amazing but fine it wouldn t pass in hawaii but lack of competition here means they ll by default get the business of ramen cravers like me their broth cannot come close to the savory complex authentic ramen i ve tried though maybe they re stretching themselves too thin with the bar and dessert boba options which i still have no idea how to order i d rather they offer a really solid ramen noodle with either a shio salt and shoyu soy broth choice or even just one absolutely amazing broth the shrimp purse happy hour appetizer was also simply fine and i wouldn t pay the normal price for it it would ve been four stars but i am taking one off for their inability to cook an egg properly everyone knows the egg should be either soft and runny to ooze it s rich golden yolk over the noodles or be made into a seasoned rolled japanese omelette tamagoyaki and sliced super thin not hard boiled don t expect a lot of customer service as they re basically operating as a fast casual chipotle type restaurant some of the tables were not cleared and wiped promptly despite employees not helping customers count me in as another person who is not a huge fan of the uncomfortable seating overall if i m in the area and hungry i ll drop by again but i really don t see myself making a special trip to this side of the valley just to eat here
  we had never tried a hungry howies until moving to the area recently we like deep dish pizza we are now fans of this place its not a gourmet sit down pizza place but its pretty darn good for fast food pizza and they deliver we like the pan pizza with butter cheese crust flavor or the garlic flavor the cheese bread is good also staff was good to us they messed up our delivery order one time and i called and they took care of our next order thats service i like and appreciate we will return
  my wife i came here for dim sum because our favorite place in mesa was so overcrowded we were hungry all dim sum items we selected at c fu gourmet were so bland i had to use a lot of soy sauce just to have some flavor gourmet should not be part of their name i don t plan to go back to this restaurant any time soon
  i love fogo my family and i went on thanksgiving while visiting vegas this was the best thanksgiving meal i ever had i am not a huge red meat fan but their meat was delicious the salad bar was excellent also the staff was friendly and always made sure we were well taken car of i plan to go to the la location next time i am craving red meat
  not the typical type of mexican food that i go for but it is good more of a commercial mexican than i generally like but the great staff has always been consistent along with the food which is what makes me fall in the four star rating
  we arrived shortly after 8 30pm to realized they closed at 9 00 no worries as they were quick to say come on in prior to our arrival we didn t know if green was a sit down or counter service upon entering we found that it would be a counter service experience nice and laid back i immediately loved the flow of the restaurant with the painted wooden tables along with tree stumps for some of the seats patio dining is available but the far end also has a see through garage door that can be opened up for open air dining too quick examination of the menu had me wanting everything it s so nice not to have to decipher which items are vegan and which ones aren t i settled on the mexicali burger however when i went to order i noticed the special the big wac what this is what everyone has been talking about in the green facebook group you see the big wac is basically the vegan version of the big mac it s not always available and absolutely everyone was raving about it i made the quick switch ordered the big wac with fries and my husband ordered the kung pao bowl did the big wac live up to the rave reviews yes and more although i admit i was never a huge burger person even prior to going veg this may be one of the best burgers i ve had in my life seriously my husband s meal was also tasty but after a nibble of my burger he immediately wished he had gone for the big wac too partnered with the yummy thin fries i had the perfect meal i can t wait to return to have another fantastic meal
  i am here late 11 pm on a friday the food here is bar food but they ve done a good job with it i made the mistake of ordering a pizza that had a lot of spice to it and they replaced it on the spot and didn t even make me ask for it they make sure you have everything you need drinks refills etc the service has been top notch the cherry on the top is the live music obadiah parker was playing and they are amazing the music was easily heard and sounded great but i could still say something to my wife without having to yell i had a great experience and will definitely return
  i cannot say enough good things about ocean trail my only complaint is that we didn t discover it sooner if you like spice and you like seafood you cannot go wrong here when you walk up to ocean trial the first time it is almost confusing and a little awkward as it is very small place and on the casino floor directly behind everyone gambling if you go on the weekends you will wait standing in a roped off line to the side but it is worth the interesting atmosphere and the wait if you are not sure what to get i must say that the pan roast is hands down the best dish ever but the crab cocktail and the shrimp boil are also amazing you really can t go wrong with anything on the menu that being said we did not enjoy the muscles however this would be the only thing on the entire menu i wouldn t recommend if you haven t been here before try it if you been here and weren t sure you fell in love try the pan roast and you will
  they changed their menu not a happy customer they used to have 3 combo lunch to choose from ramen and fried rice combo was so good now fried rice is 1 dollar extra ramen lunch combo has no chasiu absolutely no topping i can make that right at home
  met a friend here very early on a sunday morning for coffee the cashier was friendly and very helpful especially since it was our first time there she even made recommendations and provided excellent customer service i ordered an iced hazelnut coffee sweetened but no cream and also a maple bacon infused waffle the coffee and waffle were a hearty and delicious breakfast which surprised me as they were very flavorful the place has a nice coffee shop vibe music was good but not too loud and it was the perfect spot to have a conversation
  came here awhile back for a friends birthday and our whole experience was horrible staff made us feel uncomfortable and the food wasn t very good won t be coming back here
  this panda is what you would expect from panda in quality the big complaint i have here is understaffing frequently there is only one employee working the line and customers have upwards of 15 mins in wait i understand lunch rushes and that pandas have lines this one is just extraordinary in painful slowness employees are not apathetic to the speed and have come to expect this as the norm i m writing this in line only about 5 customers have been served in this time
  nice hidden gem local joint with character all our entrees were good fish and chips and cheese curds top notch good beer menu and nice wait staff will try again if in middleton
  two of us went on a sunday night just for appetizers and drinks and to check the place out i was a little worried it would be hard to find because there isn t much in southern highlands but it s well lit the only suggestion i would have is to put a sign right on pyle and decatur so that pyle is easier to find the bar was pretty full so we sat at a table server arrived right away with menus the specialty drinks all looked pretty good as far as cost they were a little more expensive than i expected but not strip prices by any means we ordered the distiller s delight and the mad mule both were tasty we also ordered the mashed potato bites and the crab bites the crab bites were a little on the pricey side but they were tasty as well the mashed potato bites were bomb i could have eaten another order of those if i had been so full our server was attentive refilled our water asked if we needed anything so no complaints there we moved to the bar after we ate as space had opened up i overheard someone complain about how smoky it was but i completely disagree there were maybe three or four people smoking in the whole place bartenders were very attentive and checked on us several times really the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars are the prices if you live in the area i would suggest you give it a go we will go back again for sure
  we tried this for the first time today for lunch we were thoroughly pleased i built my own salad that had a great variety of toppings and very fresh ingredients crisp if you will they had soups on special that were unique including cauliflower parm carrot the portions are huge the guy who took our food order was full of suggestions and knowledge while the girl who rang us up was super friendly and delivered our food to us they clean the dishes from the table great spot will be back
  truly authentic chinese food highly recommend cauliflower dish eggplant dish peking pork dumplings braised pork with egg green beans perhaps not authentic but the blueberry yam dish was interesting and quite tasty all of the above were per owner s recommendation and they were all excellent also had the spicy chicken dish which was numbingly spicy if you re into that stuff definitely a place i would recommend to others
  i keep meaning to send an email to the manager but keep forgetting we ve lived in vegas ten years now and this was probably the third happy i ever went to and loved the appetizer platter therefore have eaten here very regularly for ten years that being said the last two years or so have been absolutely horrible not sure what is going on with the management the staffing has serious issues no one is serving the bar top tables the waitresses and hostesses are aloof and rude the food and menu have now changed and are inconsistent and horrible my food tasted water logged the other day one of the new aps was inedible and i actually sent it back as i said this was my favorite meal place for ten years and also had a favorite bartender and drink this place feels like it is now relying on the drunken drug party crowd and just want to be a bar and not a restaurant the food used to be so good that i brought visitors here when they said mexican for dinner we actually stopped eating here and started eating at culinary dropout as our place of choice when in hard rock now please get it together and bring back the original happy hour menu with those potato flautas the corn cake thing and the steak skewers and quit messing with what was working the new aps are disgusting and the wait staff issue is just beyond horrible we have now walked out a few times and have been coming less and less oh and then the waitress asked us if we needed more tortillas for our fajita because it came with two dehydrated and disgusting ones so we say yes only to find a 2 dollar upcharge on our bill just ridiculous and down hill sad to lose one of my favorite restaurants for the last ten years get it together
  after a long drive to vegas my dad and i were starving we thought what the hell let s try out one of gordon ramsey s places burgr did not disappoint we were greeted kindly by 4 hosts and were sat down immediately it was shocking because it was a saturday night then i realized that it was almost midnight vegas we sat down and could not believe how low the chairs and tables were pic below our waitress greeted us with a smile took our drink orders i felt dehydrated so i ordered a water my dad on the other hand had a few black tans and obviously enjoyed them i ordered the fish crisp burger and although it took 30 minutes to arrive and was ridiculously hard to eat i really enjoyed it the cod was nicely breaded and tasted really good with the tartar sauce and onion crisps we shared the maui onion rings and could not make it through half of them because we were so full they were delicious though i will come back to try one of those gourmet milkshakes on the menu because those sounded absolutely delish
  oh god so good clearly a younger restaurant but the food is wonderful i got the waygu flank steak just a perfect steak not too salty a ton of flavor we ll be back
  i love outback they have the best cheeseburgers i know normal people go for steaks but i always get the cheeseburger they also have a drink called wild tea that is to die for
  i am a montreal native and i ve had sushi at most sushi restaurants in the city but no restaurant has been so consistently good and reasonable priced as kashima kashima has changed menus and owners several times these past few years and needless to say the prices have also gone up despite this it is still among the tastiest and freshest sushi in town i am updating my previous review and here are some comments on the sushi i had last night spicy tuna one of the best rolls fresh perfectly balanced and well proportioned so that you can actually eat it with the chop stick and it doesn t come part the tuna melts in your mouth and there is just enough mayo to make it spicy westmount with salmon tuna a solid roll a bit on the large side but thin enough so you don t make a mess while eating it flavourful its deep fried edges gives it a pleasant texture without being too oily kamikaze 3 it was just ok i remember when under a previous owner i used to have to specially request extra crispy tempura flakes because they did not put enough those days are long gone now the roll is overpacked with them making it way too large are the extra flakes being used to justify the higher prices and being put in the place of more fish montreal this roll substitutes rice with tempura flakes a less tasty version of the kamikaze in my opinion again way too much tempura not sure what purpose it serves i also didn t like that i had to use my hands to eat it and that it constantly came apart in the process i was happy overall but until those speciality rolls become better proportioned in size i m going to stick to the smaller simpler and more traditional rolls
  this place is awesome i mean 17 for all you can eat korean bbq must try the beef tongue sounds weird and crazy but it s really good and it cooks fast too squid is also delicious order the short ribs first and then dip the squid in the short ribs marinate
  came here on a friday night and sat at the bar i decided to create my own burger naturesource patty on a pretzel bun with chopped jalapeno american cheese caramelized onion jalapeno bacon chipotle aioli and button mushrooms total price came to 1million dollars it was well worth it though the burger was outstanding definitely one of the better restaurants in mandalay
  z tejas has been around forever even before i started cooking 15 years ago i remember being a punk high school kid and going to scottsdale fashion square and actually smoking on their patio that was actually inside the mall at that point in my life i had two favorite meals the tuscan lemon chicken from hoolihans and the diablo chicken pasta from z tejas sorry for being all introspective but nearly ever time i try something from my childhood that i haven t had for a long time i end up disappointed so here is my dilemma is the quality gone south or my taste buds north ug i dunno but this dish was a huge let down i remember the cotija cheese having a nice pop and the pasta being cooked perfectly this time the cheese was scant and the pasta was a mushy blob my wife says i should know better i used to think my mom s linguini was sent down by angels now ia make a fettuccini alfredo that mario battali would eat off of the floor if i dropped it its me i guess sometimes i wish i was a kid again if you still love olive garden or can t wait to go back to applebee s you will love this place if you ve moved on from your high school crushes and refined your taste buds you may just want to head in for one of their superb margaritas and eat at one of the other fabulous restaurants in the area
  authentic pakistani food must try chiken karahi barbq item you gonna love it
  this was one of those times where i walked out defiantly thinking i will not be judged yet later on when the sr asked me where was mine i had to hang my head in shame for i yer honour i did walk past and it was like a magnet pulling me in for i did indeed see me some delightful looking almond croissants let me take you back to a time when once i feasted on almond croissants in the balmy summer of the south of france i ve never tasted anything like those croissants in all my days since i left that town not that i have ever stopped trying every one i have tried has paled in comparison dry dusty overly sweet not butterly melt in the almondy mouth i m not going to lie the wee boulangerie didn t succeed either but it gave it a damn good try where most almond croissants are almond paste basted in the heart of a pastry fold and carry the body of a normal looking croissant the wee boulangerie was like a picasso impression with crispy almond sponge oozing out everywhere it didn t even really look like a croissant but it tasted light not dry not too sweet and the crispy light edges made a delightful contrast to the heaviness of the croissant itself i enjoyed every single mouthful a note as well i m on a diet almond croissants are pretty much verboten the sr is on a diet he is sick with jealousy at my hedonism i m going to have to get more to appease him thanks the wee boulangerie you destroyed my diet but in oh so such a beautiful way
  we ate here on sunday afternoon on a short stay in pittsburgh and i would definitely recommend it it s a below ground place right in a cute shopping area with a cozy warm feel it looks like it could fill up quickly but we walked right in and were able to sit at the bar to eat i had the tivoli crepe with an egg and my boyfriend had the salmon crepe which were absolutely delicious we were both members of the clean plate club within ten minutes tops full selection of sweet and more meal like crepes check it out
  after swinging by gypsy bar and lucky strike i popped into copper blues on a thursday afternoon the outdoor bar was pretty packed but the indoor bar only had two people i liked the indoor atmosphere better anyway it was dim with lounge lighting and they had the a c blasting we pulled up a couple of seats in front of alyssa at the bar she was friendly talkative and easy on the eyes the music was set at the right level to maintain conversations but kept the place lively before we knew it the bar was packed for happy hour and 1 beer shots everyone was so nice it was easy to chat it up with the other folks at the bar i didn t have time to stick around for thursday night karaoke but i will definitely be back
  our first visit and we would not be in a hurry to return went because of american airline rewards program and had heard about the place a few years ago food is nothing special lacalabria in gilbert does a much better job with better food larger portions and much better value than miele s salads are not included and house salad is 4 95 their balsamic viniagrette was basically cheap oil and some herbs and zero balsamic vinegar they had poured some balsamic and oil on a plate for dipping bread and i dumped it on my salad that was the only touch of vinegar a few cubes of cheese on top do not make a salad worth 4 95 the chicken with cheese and artichokes was so so tasted reheated not terrible but nothing i d want again i didn t know it came with a side of pasta or i would have told them to leave the heavy red sauce off so i could have enjoyed the spaghetti with the chicken s wine sauce maybe their pizza is good but i would not bother with any of the dinners on the menu after our experience service was barely adequate we had to ask for more iced tea though the server walked by our table 4 times while my glass was almost empty each time i expected him to return with the tea pitcher as happens in most restaurants he didn t notice much and the place is small and was not busy while we were there i can t imagine what happens when if it is ever busy
  attempted yesterday evening this is a smokers paradise there is no way for a non smoker to escape this appeared to be an all outdoor patio experience the bar is the centerpiece with tables in the surrounding perimeter most people at the bar were smoking and one table called my friends that were on the way and changed plans
  healthy lunch items on the menu quiches are delicious hot but not made to order can be a little pricey on the beverage side 3 5 for lattes coffee mocha or hot chocolate urban interior with cozy surroundings snuggle up to the fireplace or find a table or up top counter to plug in the computer i like the mix of people and the free wifi while sipping on a hot chai latte kiddie area outside and inside patio area in summer is nice but not shaded back room area is great for 10 15 people and can be reserved
  they have the soda fountain dispenser that let s you choose any soda fast food places can be hit or miss but this wendy s is one of the nicer ones i ve been to good job wendy s but you still need to work on those stale fries
  second visit to this restaurant and impressed with the menu for a neighborhood bar and grill this place has a very extensive menu and the best fish and chips that we have had for a long time the kitchen is very accommodating in allowing me to order off the dinner menu for lunch friendly service and one of the best parts notre dame fans we will be back
  my six word restaurant review the best indian restaurant in arizona
  i got the bottomless brunch deal however the mimosas bloody marys and sangria all lacked the correct flavor and alcohol my friends got omelettes which they enjoyed i ordered the benedict but the lobster cakes were the only good part the stuff were fabulous which help easy the blow of the horrible breakfast food
  avoid kfc at all costs the food quality is continuously horrible my food had mold on it when i called and asked to speak to a manager no one spoke english never again
  stopped by after a great lecture at asu two thai places side by side one is more of a sit down dine in place and the other where i went more of a take away although we did eat there rather small menu with the usual fare of thai food ordered the pad thai and red curry sat outside in the evening sunset which was pleasant and discussed the lecture food came in short order portions were fair sized i ordered spice hot 4 or possible 5 but it was still rather tame pad thai was ok to good it lacked fresh basil which can make the dish it had chicken and chucks of tofu which was a bit odd but i have come to find that this dish is kind of a thai chop suey whatever a place has they seem to add to the dish about the only universal is the sauce and the rice noodles a hard dish to compare to itself as the target constantly changes depending on where you order the dish my problem is that i tend to compare all thai food to that which i had in thailand and few come close to that so the scale has to be modified anyway i would go back to this place in a pinch if i wanted thai food and was in the neighborhood
  they always get the order wrong no matter how much i stress the particulars of my order just say a number and don t deviate from the menu the food is bland the place is a hot mess been there three times and always disappointed i loved this place back in sacramento here in las vegas they are just slapping beans on a plate
  let me start with the good stuff the grilled corn appetizer was delicious the server was polite at the start now on to the disappointments two of the folks in our party were brought cold entrees when they told our server her response was no they weren t as if she didn t believe us the entrees were remade and took a very long time to receive the rest of our group had finished their food by the time it came out the bill was confusing and even after the manager explained it to us it became apparent that communication is a skill they lack we had been charged for chips and salsa even though we gave our server the yelp check in incentive for free chips and salsa btw what mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa we had some bar drinks that were 5 and some that were 11 server didn t tell us about happy hour when we ordered or that some drinks would be discounted and not others we had charges for sauce even though the ladies who asked for queso instead of red or green sauce on their enchiladas weren t told it would be an additional charge and of course there was the surprise charge for extra rice for the guest who asked for only rice no beans with her meal i have never been charged so carelessly by a restaurant although the the manager did comp the two meals that came out cold this experience was so awful that i can not recommend this restaurant the icing on the cake was the booth were were seated in had dirty seats food on the floor and was situated by a high top table that two of us knocked into getting in and out of our seats don t bother trying this place it s over priced offers poor food quality isn t clean and the staff isn t trained in guest service
  i love their pizza it s one of the best i ve had in vegas the bartender keith is always pleasant and does a great job getting our food and drinks to us enjoy their selection of beer and wine great place to go have pizza i have never been disappointed
  there were 5 of us that went to the bigham yesterday for drinks and dinner the food was great i had the home made tots and mediterranean pizza both were good i favored the tots our server was awesome she had a smile on her face the whole time great personality i went to smoke outside and when i returned i had come to find out a joke they played on me my daughter told the server she was putting the ketchup and mustard bottle in my purse while it was left open then our server i wish i could remember her name asked when i returned where did my ketchup bottle go as her eyes glanced at my purse i wanted to die my face got beet red as a removed it to place back on the table while i was saying i don t know how that got in there we all had a good laugh thanks for the hospitality and going along with a funny joke love the bigham
  if you want to step back in time this is the spot to go vintage goodies all over a vintage thrift shop attached good food and great ice cream creations
  the way it was talked up i was expecting great pizza what i got was good not great it has a wide variety of options chicken wings were not bad either
  my favorite ribs in town free breakfast on the weekends awesome service what else can you ask for
  great beer selection good food fried okra is awesome good local bar lots of character ping pong and cornhole in the outdoor patio
  ummm good i love spicy asian food and thailicious was recommended to me by a friend they were so right great flavor without scorching my taste buds the service was great and the prices for lunch were great if you love thai food then this place should be on your a list and if you a member of the lunch club we will be here in october for sure
  while on a trip to vegas to experience some great food and good atmosphere union was a huge disappointment after trying a different and amazingly wonderful restaurant in aria the night before we opted to give union a shot since they had a seemingly good prix fixe menu for 49 i ordered the roasted tomato soup the organic chicken and the 7 layer chocolate cake for dessert my partner opted for the king crab and jalapeno taco the chilean sea bass and the apple pie for dessert we also chose to add the wine pairing for 20 as well when you go to a show you don t expect it to peak in the first act and that s what happened at union the appetizers were by far the best aspect of the whole experience but given that it was tomato soup and tacos it s not hard to screw those things up for the entree round my chicken was a tad overcooked and borderline rubbery the garlic spinach that came with it was great as was the tablespoon of parsnip puree that accompanied it the sea bass was equally rubbery and overcooked and a delicious sounding risotto that came with the sea bass was slightly undercooked and on the starchy side the desserts were just ok nothing special my cake was on the dry side but the apple pie was not bad i have to echo what others have said about the service it s abysmal the guy serving water was the hardest working person on the crew after we ordered we barely saw our waiter it was a revolving door of people coming by which is not unusual but our waiter rarely checked on us he dropped our wine off in the same manner as a delivery person dropping off a package i was surprised that a wine pairing didn t come with dessert especially after seeing other places in aria and other resorts offering a pairing with each course had we known that we probably would have ordered a bottle instead but the waiter didn t take the time to explain that we found out after our dessert was delivered while we were there we noticed two groups get seated and subsequently leave without being served there was plenty of staff so i m not sure what the problem was they all seemed in a constant state of chaos the atmosphere is not bad if you want something quiet and peaceful this is probably not the place since it overlooks a big bank of slot machines that constantly sing overall i would definitely not recommend this to anyone going to vegas for a culinary treat there are plenty of better options within aria and there are several other places nearby to get a much better steak if that s what you re looking for save your money and your time and treat yourself somewhere else
  barrio queen is quite possibly my favorite place in scottsdale the food is amazing the margaritas are strong the service is great and the patio is perfection we find ourselves there every month or so i always get something different the tacos are awesome but kind of on the small side i could probably eat 10 the quesadilla on happy hour is fantastic i ordered two the enchiladas are yummy and filling the house margaritas on happy hour for 3 are perfection all tequila shots on happy hour are half off so it s a good way to try new kinds with out opening your wallet wider than you d like i wish they would bring back the goat cheese and shrimp quesadilla though it was hands down the best thing on the menu when we have friends come to town this is the first place i bring them usually just for an afternoon happy hour to relax sip margaritas and try as many items on the menu as our stomachs can handle when we stopped in last week our server maggie was super helpful with picking out a few tequilas and was very nice the service is always great and on point
  great place in heart of arcadia nice staff great american food and awesome location love this place i go here about 3 times a month check it out
  so i ate here for lunch it was my 1st trip to the place if you are to head here it seems better suited to be a dinner or late night visit first off this place encompasses half a city block well not really but it is pretty huge we decided to sit outside on the patio but the inside looked huge with a large bar 2 pool tables several seating areas the place wasn t too packed but it was after the lunch crowd hour so i m sure we caught it at a light time as for the menu while very good it s just a little heavy for a lunch menu maybe i ordered something a little too filling but from what i saw on the menu everything was more suited to the dinner crowd if they had lunch portions then i think this could make it a little better place to grab lunch the food was great though i d definitely consider going back for dinner next time the one thing i regret not doing was ordering one of their beers i ve heard how good some of them are was planning on ordering a pint but my meal was too filiing i couldn t see myself downing anything else i ll be back for dinner here next time remember to order my beer before i eat my meal
  we arrived here having taken a cab from the strip and i can safely say that it was one of the best meals we ve had in vegas food was great and such a refreshing change from the overpriced food on the strip our waitress was awesome and suggested jewel of russia infusion to us and we nearly drank half the bottle it was so good we will definitely be going there again
  my husband and i went on a date here atmosphere was fantastic the food was not we ordered the calamari appetizer that was so so i had the osso bucco he had lasagna both tasted like they had been previously cooked and then microwaved would be a great place to go for drinks but we won t be eating here again it was too expensive for the food to taste like that
  had dinner at stinky s last evening on a recommendation of a friend meh recommended the codfather fish sandwich and the harp the harp is like a philly cheese steak our party ordered both of these and yes they are very good the stinky chips are thin and crisp very good ok here comes the but it isn t call stinky for no reason the odor of disinfectant was extremely strong even after being inside for 20 minutes the smell still burned the nose if you can get past this the food is good
  big huge slices of fish my biggest ever experienced in arizona i could not believe it the chef just smiled he knew i was happy before i even put it in my mouth the rice was fresh partly because we went for lunch i started off with some warm sake and miso soup a must when you sit at any sushi bar miso was good and then after my dad and i handed our order the chef put some nice fresh wasabi you can tell when it s fresh because of the potent smell and gooey like texture accompanied by a very pink ginger it was very yummy and would hold me off till the sushi arrived first up was the maguro tuna it was alright big slices but not very fresh or flavorful the hamachi yellowtail was different same big slice but fresh bold flavor absolutely delicious then the sake salmon which was good not as good as the hamachi and finally to finish off our nigiri sushi the albacore oh my gosh beautiful presentation with finely sliced scallions on top this was the winner of both my dad and i it was sooo soo soo good then the rolls came out a baked scallop roll which is a califronia roll with massago and scallop on top and also a dragon roll which was unagi freshwater eel inside with spicy tuna and avocado on the outside my dad and i weren t impressed very much by the rolls sort of sloppy in preparation and not very appetizing but the nigiri well it captured our hearts we will be sure to come back and order some different rolls next time i give the chef some credit maybe he didn t have his groove on yet because it was early in the day haha but either way he made loyal customers out of us also the atmosphere here is very quaint family style operation run by wife and husband is what it seemed like very nice friendly people great service and they gave us some complimentary watermelon slices before we left gotta love that parking is great location well right next to sprouts and it s sort of a hole in the wall but nice size once you open the door sushi rolls were 10 each and the sushi was 4 25 each warm sake was 3 99 and i also ordered a cold one which was 8 99 good prices better than kabuki across the street and cheaper sushi price than tokyo lobby but the fish wasn t as good as tokyo lobby
  when in today to get rice and garlic chicken with an order of egg rolls let me tell you that shit hit the spot the sauce for the egg rolls was the bomb i recommend this to anyone i ll be back for more egg rolls and garlic chicken especially the egg roll sauce
  they delivered dinner right to my hotel room door with a 20 minimum dinner order they ll deliver for free when it comes to sushi it s easy to spend that much i ordered a serving of won ton soup the tempura roll the lobster roll and a bottle of water for a total of 25 before tip the won ton soup hit the spot the broth with scallions was delicous with a hint of ginger without being spicy it was only two or three won tons but it was enough of a serving the tempura roll was average and fine the lobster roll was a huge disappointment the menu description was boiled lobter with cucumber and it was just that but the lobster was hard like cardboard and hard to chew it came with duck sauce and soy sauce but that didn t help i couldn t eat it all and i love lobster i would try them again especially since they deliver but i would order different rolls
  36 00 for a whole pizza the wait was about 30 mins did a phone order so i dont have to wait in line it s good but i wouldnt say i would wait for this the only reason i did it was because my friends wanted to eat this
  you can definitely tell as soon as you walk up to switch that it is part of the fez ticoz family the decor is bright modern and colorful a style of atmosphere that always makes me feel comnfortable and excited about the food even before i try it i met kym s here for lunch and wasn t feeling so hot the morning after a pretty long night out on the town before long thanks to some great company and satisfying food i was feeling a lot better kym s ordered the sangria chicken sandwich which came with a side caesar it looked great and was massive but i ll let her comment on how good it was i was craving something really filling so i got the gallette pronounced gah let according to our server with beef and mushrooms 10 45 plus 1 95 to add a field greens salad and it was fantastic i think i was expecting something like a meat pie which it was not but i was happy with what it actually was a thin layer of puff pastry topped with savory beef slices mushrooms and a creamy gouda sauce it really hit the spot the field greens salad was good although it was soaked in dressing which kind of drowned out the flavor of the fresh greens the service was definitely a highlight of the experience our server was very attentive and kept checking back with us he also brought carafes of water and diet coke over which is a brilliant business move on my part it streamlines and facilitates service because people aren t constantly asking for refills and both the servers and customers end up happier the diet coke i ordered was a bit on the pricey side around 2 75 but i was ok with this given the fact that i had a carafe to refill from this is a really nice spot to meet a friend for lunch and i will definitely be back i also think it would make a great place for a casual low key happy hour from their website it looks like they have drink specials from 4 6 30 2 4 1 caipirinhas margaritas and sangria
  great place to grab some tacos the prices match most local taco trucks there s lots of room at this location so it doesn t feel to packed although the live band isn t the best choice to have a tleast not the one that was playing tonight the amount of profanity wasn t exactly inviting i have 3 kids and i was a bit in shock when they started screaming f ck we will definitely be back for more the corn is a must to get way better than roberto s i m glad they stay open later on the weekends fast and friendly service
  this place is boring and tries way too hard the menu is limited i had the pigstrami sandwich it was ok not great i ordered the side salad but the brought me fries they couldn t leave the ketchup alone it was gross because they tried to make it special i will never go back because there are too many other great options in the area
  love the ambiance at this nice little spot came with some friends for a little sunday funday eugene was our bartender and was awesome they make fresh greyhounds by fresh i mean fresh squeezed juice to order sooooo good drinks were good and food was too
  love this place for lunch i always start with the hummus it is delicious and the pita wedges are fresh and you can tell they are made daily for the entree the turkey pita is my fav and the kale salad that accompanies the sandwich is a perfect compliment the only drawback is the place is a bit loud and impersonal at lunch not really ideal for intimate conversations or a business lunch overall it is a solid 4 stars
  this place is a great place to hang out if you live in the area or are just passing thru the bar is clean and the staff is extremely friendly i have been coming here for the last year or so since i moved into the neighborhood and i have never had a bad experience the food is way above par as far as bar food goes but the pricing is still comparative to most other bars in the area
  a regular on my breakfast rotation friendly staff plenty of seating and good food for a good price one of the very few places that has pineapple juice as a selection which is a refreshing change from orange apple cranberry
  the food was ok i was expecting a much better piece of steak we ordered the hanger steak and the classic steak both was alright but nothing to get excited about or wanting to come back for more i definitely think they should substitute some of the fritas for steamed veggies more than half of the plate was the fritas the view was nice from the patio overall it was a nice experience but most likely i won t be coming back again for dinner
  i have eaten here few times while visiting las vegas i have had breakfast and dinner the food has always been always great except coffee which has been below average however i am giving only 3 stars because of service when you are by yourself and not ordering alcohol the serves profile you they know you won t spend tons of money so they don t give you as much attention
  stopped in here with a group of fellow traveler s for the prix fixe lunch before heading up the road to the castle the choices were actually pretty good i ended up with a garlic cheesebread appetizer salmon stuffed chicken and vegetables for the entree and a piece of fudge cake for the dessert the garlic cheesebread was not what i expected it was served on a sliced piece of ciabatta bread with very little melted cheddar cheese it was more like eating toasted bread i couldn t find a hint of garlic in it and i was expecting mozzarella cheese and this italian sounding appetizer it wasn t bad but not what i expected i was thinking more along the lines of an italian dunker than half a grilled cheese sandwich the entree was very well done both the chicken and salmon were superb the sauce on the entree was also quite nice the vegetables were a bit over done and were very limp and flavorless the dessert was also very good and the waitress made this fun for us by playing a goofy birthday song i d never heard before and bringing out a piece with a candle in it for one of our group members who had a birthday i m only giving this 3 stars though for the price i don t think it was a very good value at 22 pounds without beverage almost usd 40 i feel like the portions were a bit small and the culinary value didn t quite command that sort of price it was included in my trip package so i wasn t out anything out of pocket really but i couldn t recommend it to someone else unless it were a bit cheaper nice little place though service was very good and the food came out quickly maybe other dishes would be better and priced more appropriately
  tasty curry i like this place a lot especially because you can chose the level of spice you want i generally like spicy and so level 2 wasn t so bad there was kick to it but i m sure i could have gotten a higher level of spiciness i do wish the portion was a little bigger though but i still would come back regardless two thumbs up
  the standard chain burrito joint that lacks flavor and is way overpriced the burritos are very wet meaning by the time you eat half of it the other half will fall apart so ask for a fork
  i was in town for the cal asu game this past weekend and a few of us bear fans decided to leave sun devil stadium halftime for a beer break well we never made it back for the second half of the game i m originally from south scottsdale so i know the tempe area pretty well and i know that whatever business is on this corner has always failed it seems like every bar that s been in this space has had more of a loungey feel which doesn t really make sense when you re across the street from a football stadium the fact that this place feels like an actual bar is a big plus the place isn t huge and surprisingly wasn t all that crowded for a game day apparently it s only been open a couple of weeks there wasn t much on tap but the four peaks brew that i was drinking was tasty they also had 4 jaager shots which i downed a couple of honestly i didn t get a good look at the menu food or drink but since this place is still in the process of opening everything is still a work in progess i shared an order of nachos with some friends and they didn t disappoint as far as the crowd goes it s a slightly older group of alums 30 s 40 s which is probably why our experience was so pleasant rooting for the visiting team in a college town can be an interesting experience as far as dealing with current students our waitress erica was awesome she was attentive and patient which is a major asset when you re working a college bar the excellent level of service may have had something to with the fact that i told her i yelp my tab seemed a bit smaller than it should have been as well but hey either way i had a great time since i don t live here i obviously won t become a regular but i would definitely recommend this place to those hanging out around the asu campus who want an alternative to the mill scene
  my boyfriend and i have been here 3 times in the past 3 weeks i visited s korea last summer and the food here is exactly how it was there from the way it is served to the taste my boyfriend loves the spicy pork and i really like the bulgogi the tofu soups are delicious as well the only thing that makes me a little sad is that they no longer serve the patbingsu due to lack of popularity how do people not love red bean it s delicious the first time we came the lady who helped us was nice enough to make me some though for dessert they now serve iced coffee or fresh fruit additionally the people who work here are incredibly nice and they remember us every time we come in prices are great we will definitely be returning many many more times to get our korean food fill
  amazing place to hangout great prices for beers must visit place after the management change this place has transformed drastically to greatness their manager jeff has done a great job and is always on site for help the service is great and fast over all great food great beer great place
  a ok hole in the wall authentic mexican seafood place in a not so great part of town coworkers and i tried this place out for lunch one of them was raving about how great it was and i am always one to try new things especially seafood restaurant itself is spacious and clean inside you can buy fresh seafood we sat down and waitress came to our table i don t like how she didn t address us in english only one of us knew spanish they serve chips and salsa on the house which was nice it was very tasty with the right amount of spice i ordered a langostino dish don t remember the exact name refer to the pic below it was served with rice beans salad and tortilla the dish overall was ok edible but there was something off about the taste maybe i was scared to break out which was what happened to my other coworker the last time he came so i had some trepidation about my meal he had shrimp in a prior visit he avoided it this time around and the tortillas tasted weird i don t know if it was homemade or cooked in lard but i only had one and it was enough to keep me from wanting more i don t see myself coming back the price overall was decent it was paid for lol but i wouldn t come back and pay on my own i m not sure if i d really recommend this restaurant due to its location and overall average experience
  while i ve been here a number of times i haven t explored the menu enough to provide a comprehensive review good weekend bloody mary 3 4 star generous pour with limited accompaniments but they worked prime rib good flavor ok cut a little thin and cooked on the medium side when i asked for medium rare burger not too bad pork tenderloin sandwich good i d order it again mozzarella sticks contender for the best in town fries were ok not so good service a bit slow chicken sandwich was dry and had a small piece of chicken didn t finish it despite skipping breakfast bathroom mens could use some work rocky point puerto penasco location do yourself a favor and close that place down
  i ve been to social only twice even though it is within walking distance of home easy and is on the no wait app that definitely says something i ve even been putting off this review because of how unmentionable our 2nd visit here was the first time coming here 1 and i were feeling adventurous we re not big eaters so the dirty bird a thai skewer type starter and margherita pizza sounded great to share the skewers were small but done well paired with rice i ate most of this glaring at the poor man when he went to reach for another the pizza was mostly basil but we still ate half it was better as leftovers the next morning for sure but nothing incredible i think the saddest part was how boring our bevvies were delicious but too simple the wolfhound is my kind of sweet vodka with elderflower of course dream but at the crafty cocktail price no overall the service this night was great and we decided overall we could come here again it would work well for groups with pissy picky eaters me unfortunately the next time i was here not so lucky a girlfriend and i were out for drinks and wanted a little munchies upon arriving we were carded at the door by some random unmarked man just hanging out there weren t any servers or hosts so we figured bar only fine the crowd was horrific kids that looked not old enough to be there seated around the packed bar with rowdy older couples the whole thing was not my style we were finally given drink menus without a word kitchen must be closed fine again we ordered our drinks about ten minutes later when she chose to acknowledge us two prosecco cosmos they arrived frothy and low in the glass there is no nice way to say it but they were soapy almost a pear shampoo use your imagination we laid our 25 on the counter in cash and got out of there silver lining we had our lyft driver drop us off at aiello s to make up for the horrific time at social it was necessary looking for creepy patrons and horrible boring overpriced drinks this is your spot get excited for nonverbal bartenders too if you re desperate during the kitchen hours it s okay i wouldn t suggest it but i d grudgingly tag along
  this is hands down one of the best restaurants in town my husband and i have been here to eat many times and the food is consistently excellent the restaurant is always clean and the staff is super friendly when it came time to decide on what food to serve at our intimate backyard wedding the choice was clear dave the owner worked with us on creating a menu of our favorite foods and arrived the day of our wedding prepared and professional and of course the food was amazing
  oh yayo taco where have you been all my life i would have never known about this place if it weren t for yelp thanks yelp tucked away in a corner of a half empty shopping plaza with no real sign telling you the name of the place i would have driven by a thousand times and been none the wiser but not this day i was informed and ready to get my taco on the reason i was so excited to get here was the rumor that they had vegetarian tacos imagine my surprise when there was not just one but four tacos on the menu that were veggie friendly no seriously imagine it i ll wait so my husband and i both ordered the combo which includes 4 tacos i got one of each of course two sides and a drink for our sides we both got chips and salsa i got the rice and he got the fries while we waited for our food we found a seat and instantly fell in love this place has a super fun colorful dive bar feel that my husband and i loved how could you not have a smile on your face when you see a couple sharks on the wall or a picture of a chick with a hook for a hand although there is writing all over the walls and tables that does not mean the place is dirty it was super clean if you can t handle some writing on your table then you should go back to the strip to eat the combos are huge so come hungry the rice was flavorful the chips were perfectly cooked and salted and even the fries were great i wasn t expecting much there from a mexican joint the tacos are loaded with onions peppers zucchini and even some baby spinach i had to eat mine with a knife and fork so i didn t make a mess on the white shirt i inappropriately wore for the day the veggies weren t greasy like some other reviewers seemed to have a problem with and the tacos were loaded with lots of sauce i didn t have a 100 fairy tale experience here and i ll tell you why three of the four tacos looked and tasted pretty much the same to me i was having a hard time figuring out the difference between them three of my tacos should have had tofu one had a lot another had a tiny bit and the third had none at all also the tacos could have used a little more flavor oomph however big props for having several choices for us veggie people friendly service and a fun atmosphere my husband and i are really excited to get back for some adult beverages and of course eat up a couple veggie tacos
  cool atmosphere happy hour not bad fish tacos are pretty delish will come back again close to stadium which is nice for game day
  i ve had one okay experience at thai lahna and one pretty bad experience the first trip my friend and i received our food promptly and it was good i had the pad kee mow and it was tasty and the serving size was large enough to have a take home box the service was nothing to write home about but it wasnt awful the second time i came with my husband the service was deplorable it took us 20 minutes just to get a glass of water and an acknowledgement of our presence my husband ordered pad see eew i m so sorry i don t know the correct spelling i m just going phonetically here and the waitress told him that they didn t have it it s a pretty common thai dish so he asked for it by a different name like drunken noodles and she said she didn t know it again and only knew the number common for restaurants with hard to pronounce dishes she said she didn t know the names of the dishes she just wrote down the numbers she was really short with us and basically belted that if it wasnt on the menu they didn t have it she then asked her colleague to come over to our table to again point out that they don t have the dish and began speaking over our table to each other in spanish she then left for 10 minutes when someone from the kitchen staff came out my husband asked again for the dish he desired and the staff member knew it immediately and put in the order i can understand a fresh server and someone who isn t as familiar with the menu but to be put on the floor with zero training and to be so rude to a customer really blows my mind
  my favorite bagel shop in the qc unique combos fun atmosphere quick service and the bagels are delish definitely make sure you come here
  frozen fusion margaritas are awesome love them cornbread and food is also all incredibly great here
  ok food found a hair on my honey dew melon slice disgusting 4 50 for a glass of cranberry juice nothing spectacular rather try something else
  this place is always quick and delicious you won t be disappointed the sweet potato fries are my favorite and the sauces are delightful the only downside is that it s pricey for a mid level restaurant that serves like a burrito joint if there was one closer to my beating path i would eat there more if the price was a little lower
  this is one of my favorite mexican restaurants in town they have the usual expected menu tacos burritos enchiladas etc at really reasonable prices in the years that i have been going there the food has always been delicious and everyone i have taken has been won over the staff is friendly and attentive i have always had really good service i can t say enough about la canasta this place is awesome two things though the dining room closes at 7 pm and they don t do separate checks
  love coming here decided to go after passing by everyday i was impressed the chicken lettuce wraps are delicious ive ordered so much sushi from here that i cant name but it is always really good and well made popiahs are good no complaints for this place i m a regular here
  what is a better way to shop than drinking free tea don t sit here and read my review do yourself the favor of jumping in the car and going over there to see what it s all about the people that run the store sorry i forgot the guys name and the mom grandmom esk indian woman in the back cooking samosas just totally embody what we are all looking for when we walk into a place for the first time try this taste that have a cup of tea dear bring your friends bring your family grab a cart and go on an excursion take your time this place is sweet and so are the people running it
  haven t had much bbq in town but this is my go to spot with the trio platter of meats and sides noticed a price increase on their menu recently which bothers me but i don t mind paying for their excellent food always have leftovers so better make sure you re hungry sides i recommend include the cornbread greens mashed potatoes and onion strings made the mistake of going on a sunday when they weren t open so check them out monday through saturday
  good sandwiches fast delivery call don t order online for the quickest delivery i have had an issue with an order once and they took care of ot quickly
  gave this place a try since i saw it is now open initially i was going to order a burger until i saw they had pastrami on the menu i was thrown by the prices a bit for a fast food place it all seemed a bit overpriced i had a pastrami sandwich that cost almost 8 for just the sandwich no fries or drink because that would have been almost 12 now the sandwich had mustard pickles cheese and was on garlic ciabatta bread i liked the flavor of the meat it was tender and the other stuff on the sandwich all meshed well together for 2 people to eat complete meals here it can run around 25 which is too pricey for a drive thru joint i did find on their website though how you can sign up for deals and they had printable coupons posted for really good deals on meals that include a drink i will come back with coupons because i did like the sandwich but i d never pay regular price
  went to taylor s for breakfast and was thoroughly satisfied with all aspects of this cute little restaurant the menu had lots of interesting options but wasn t overwhelming i was impressed with the service even before our server brought my friend more hot water for her tea without having to request it i had the open face omelet with spinach scallions and goat cheese with a bialy the dish was very tasty and came with a side of fresh fruit i thought the bialy was more bagel like than bialy but i wasn t in ny so i don t live in phoenix and was brought to this restaurant while my husband and i were in town for a couple of days i thought it was a great choice if i did live in phoenix and i had to take friends to breakfast who were in from out of town i would definitely consider taylor s
  had to bring this down to four stars went back for the third time yesterday and the food has only gotten better and the service has only gotten worse it took our drinks 25 min to get to us we ordered our drinks about 10 min before our food and actually got our food before our drinks we ordered another drink as soon as our first arrived for fears of never getting another one our waters were empty non stop this is how it always is here and the waiter asked if we needed anything else three times each time we said yes the bill i will still continue to come here because i know they are going to quick and the food is so amazing but come on nearly half an hour for a pre made frozen margarita
  best greek restaurant in the valley the owner really makes you feel at home service is fantastic and the food is delicious whether you want a traditional gyro or something a little more eclectic this place has it all and the best part is it s family owned so you know your money is going back to the source
  used to love this place when i worked nearby i went by for a banh mi and they got my order wrong the girl gave me an attitude when i told her and tried to charge me again i swore i d never go back but later gave them a second chance i ordered about banh mi and waited a good 20 min there was about five people in the restaurant at one point i went up to the register and the guy handed me my to go bag without saying anything it was sitting there the whole time i was sitting right in front of him
  i am standing outside as we speak waiting for my husband to pay no desert there was no way i was waiting and our waitress seemed like she was done for the night anyway the service was horrible our waitress started out fine then half way through our meal abandoned us would not even make eye contact i guess we were too much trouble for her the table of six that just got seated got all her attention had to get a different waitress to bring the check had to flag down a busboy to order another beer i usually way over tip but i told my husband i would disown him if he left a tip ruined our date night so disappointed 15 minutes into the dinner i thought we d found out new favorite place the restaurant is smaller than i thought and all the hard surfaces echo all the noise it became too much to handle thus i wait outside i tend to avoid crab mix because i do not like mayo actually i loathe it so when we ordered two rolls that did not list crab mix i was disappointed that they were both loaded with crab mix and mayonnaise the only thing i tasted was mayonnaise more mayo than a tuna sandwich wtf will never go back there are too many good restaurants in the area i m so disappointed because i was lovin it the salmon collar and the soft shell crab sweet potato appetizer were delicious
  not a big fan of burgers and i thought the burgers tasted like mcdonalds burgers but i was hungry it s a place seems like everyone after clubs and bars go to
  the herb box is a fantastic place to have lunch or get something to go i have eaten in as well as to go many times and yesterday stopped by and took home the turkey avocado wrap sweet potato chips and oatmeal cookie so large i could only have a few bites i couldn t help but have a cheat meal i hadn t been in awhile delicious i normally do not order wraps anywhere but they are so wonderful here again i do not usually get desert but their cookies are wonderful the oatmeal cookie really tastes like oatmeal and raisins instead of a pile of sugar everything is so fresh and high quality did i mention they have diet coke a must in my book and it is free refills which isn t out of the ordinary but the specialty is it is poured from the can the most amazing little restaurant i love the feeling i have when i am there it is a place you want to bring a book and enjoy alone or with friends it is small but that is the attraction to go is always great at this restaurant not like others where you do not get the same quality this might be because they are a catering company i am new to arizona and miss having lunch with my girlfriends when i come here not only is the food wonderful i feel like i am a part of something it s great p s i see there is a location in dc ranch now and looks like it is more than just a lunch place i will have to try this but for now only have experienced the original love it
  if you want teriyaki chicken this is the best place in my opinion i ve been to teriyaki boy and teriyaki madness and i didn t think they were that good at all the only thing is that it s located inside galleria mall so it s not exactly a quick pick up if your not already inside the mall i ve only really stuck to the chicken but they do have the option for steak and shrimp also they give you decent portions but if your thinking about taking some home or sharing there is also an option for double meat for a minimal extra charge make sure to ask for extra sauce too
  this is a good sandwich shop because you get a lot for your money and it s a good place to decompress if you want to get away from all the excitement in las vegas when i went there the place was completely empty however don t let that deter you from checking it out the only thing this place needs is hot sauce i m used to finding that at sandwich shops and i was surprised to find that they didn t have any here good sandwiches and fun employees make this place worth checking out
  service sucks my bf went in to use the bathroom while i was in the car getting my son out before we went into the restaurant i sat down and the owner was yelling to take my order when my bf got out of the bathroom the owner yells out oh i didnt know u where with them i guess he was mad that he used their bathroom their table cover is the paper you lay on in the doctors office but the pizza was good if the owner and his family wasnt so rude id tip them and give them 4 stars
  the best thai place i ve ever eaten at great vegan options i used to eat here all the time a few years ago i miss it so we are going tonight the area is a little scary but worth it for the great food and plum wine i kind of like the decoration in there also makes it feel like grandmas house hoping for another great experience since i m bringing my bf and his family here later tonight
  the food here is always good if you get a bowl you can select the size and ingredients to your liking there is a great selection of proteins as well as variety of veggies and fruits to add topped with the sauce and spices to complete the experience they also accommodate for soy allergies so that s a bonus
  it was perfect and authentic we weren t up for picking crabs this evening but enjoyed the lump crab cake made maryland style
  it s the real thing i ve been to n awlins many many times this is what the food tastes like try the cornish game hen you won t be sorry
  yes to all of the above woodlands is simply fantastic though we d been wanting to try it for a while we hadn t trekked out to woodlands simply because it was in our eyes all the way out in the boonies off albemarle road despite growing up in the clt i can count on one hand the times i have actually driven on albemarle road imagine my surprise then when we passed the old eastland mall and i was all ohhhh this is where eastland used to be anyway last night however searching for a restaurant that wasn t participating in restaurant week we decided to head out to woodlands and we were pleasantly surprised when it took us less than 15 minutes to get out there excellent despite previous reviews the exterior and decor weren t particularly off putting it seems to me that almost every great indian place i ve eaten at has a very similar set up udipi in cary anyone so it felt like home i do love opening a menu and knowing i can order anything off it this time i settled on the chef s specialty of chana batura and husband ordered aloo gobi and garlic naan the puffy bread with my dish was like a light unsweetened funnel cake fried indulgent deliciousness and it sopped up the chana so very well the chana were perfect husband s aloo gobi was so delicate and tasty and the garlic naan just blew me away yum to absolutely everything we also ordered a couple samosas which were also perfect just the right amount of spice and flaky beyond belief the service was excellent for what it s worth although we ve got maharani around the corner which i like very much as well as copper which underwhelms me despite all its hoopla i imagine we ll be making the well worth it drive out to woodlands when we re in the mood for particularly fabulous indian food love this place
  i love this place my co workers and i have lunch here on occassion and we have yet to try something from the wonderfully creative menu that we don t like the people running this place are some of the nicest i ve come across in food service in quite a while i ve only been for dinner once and it was almost closing time but they did not try to rush us one bit the most recent pizza i tried was the ponderosa it has ranch and bbq with chicken tomato and onion which i switched out for red peppers at the suggestion of the guy behind the counter and it was delicious i would also recommend their salad the house dressing is really good they have a small selection of wine and beer too
  worst dining experience i ve had in a long time i ordered the half sandwich and soup combo it was grilled cheese and french onion the sandwich was a piece of plastic like cheese on some plain toast the soup was even worse it was a tiny bowl of broth with a slice of cheese placed on top super disappointed couldn t even eat it i will never come back here again
  i had high expectations of this place because of the awesome reviews and all of the yelp pictures looked amazing so we were pretty stoked to finally check it out overall it was just an okay experience we did not get what we payed for and believe me we have no problem paying for good food we ordered the pork belly and also the cream corn with lobster for appetizers the pork belly was very flavorful but it was a bit salty it only came with one slice i couldn t taste the lobster in the cream corn the cream corn lacked cream and flavor and was also a bit dried our entrees did kinda make up for the appetizers we got the bass and the duck they kinda overdid the lemon on the bass but other than that it tasted pretty good the duck was pretty good as well out of everything the service was probably the worst it wasn t super busy at the time that we went there were 3 different servers and not one of them checked up on us throughout our dinner no smiles and just kept walking past us they never filled up our waters they never offered a dessert menu seemed like they didn t wanna be there i did notice that it was the same service for the tables next to us as well so it wasn t just us if we re paying this much i expect the service to be top notch i m sure if we came on another day and there s different servers and if we ordered other items on the menu we would have a better experience good to try once but because of the experience that we had we won t be returning
  the ambiance presents a nice and relaxing environment to start your day we arrived a little afternoon so ordered two lunch apps with breakfast entrees the soup de jour was tomato and it was fine basic lots of cream and didn t really deliver that amazing tomatoey goodness we were looking for with the soup came our pommes frites which were the best food of the meal hot crispy creamy inside and seasoned perfectly our entrees consisted of the omelette with bacon tomato and spinach and the french toast with cinnamon apples and caramelized bananas the omelette was basic nothing special and certainly not seasoned bland and boring it was definitely a disappointment the french toast was good it comes out looking like a square of bread pudding but has a nice flavor and consistency we also ordered 2 overpriced champagne cocktails both were fine but i was in no way blown away our server was very nice and professional but overall the food was not what i would expect from a thomas keller restaurant
  i got a burrito and unlike a few other authentic places in town the quality of the meat is noteworthy no gristle not fat and very delicious price is right and although the size could be a little bigger they do pack a good amount of meat in there will return
  this place seemed like it would be in an airport except that the food was actually good here counter service great selection of salads sandwiches soup and breakfast items along with daily specials the staff was very friendly and helpful explaining every item i asked about and even gave us samples to taste you can see salads and other stuff on display in the cold case but they actually make your salad to order i got the cobb see pics with dijon vinaigrette it was really really good i loved that dressing and everything was crisp cold and fresh i also ordered a small size of the white bean soup see pics as you can see it was huge i ended up taking it home and had it for dinner there is a draw back to this place though seating sucks only a few small tables and some counter seating i would suggest coming here solo or only with 1 person unless you sit outside they do have a large patio with alot of tables wth this is az the main dining area should be inside aside from that i thought the food was great and i would definitely eat here again
  this place is just an average casino buffet that you can find everywhere nothing too bad and nothing too special
  this has been on my list for quite sometime and it finally worked out that i was in the area for lunch didn t quite see anything on the buffet i wanted so i ordered from the menu i got 3 maki rolls and 2 yakitori skewers the sushi was very fresh and the spicy tuna roll was unique instead of the typical spicy mayo it had a some what bbq sauce with a nice heat to it different but not bad in any way the bacon wrapped scallop yakitori is damn good will most definitely come back in the future
  very good food with lots of choices but my favorite thing has to be the iced tea selection i will not return to a restaurant that doesn t have good tea this place has an iced tea bar different flavors it is wonderful makes me wish they offered larger cups but i get it will return many times
  worst chicken parm ever including frozen meals but very good pizza i give it 2 stars if you are an italian place it is not acceptable to have terrible chicken parm sorry
  this place is always good i eat here as often as possible the food is great and so is the service
  absolutely horrible i ve had bad service at other ihop locations but this particular location receives a gold medal for worst service ever i was told the wait would be 15 minutes max and 30 minutes later my party was seated the sodas were flat and warm ick so the waitress exchanged them for fresh ones which were also flat and warm we settled for water and coffee can t go wrong there i suppose except for the water glasses had bits of food stuck to them from the food took an absurdly long time to come out when it did we were all disappointed friend s pancakes included several black hairs inside of the pancake my side of ranch was obviously old with a yellow tinge and sour taste my breakfast sandwich was drenched in butter other friend s pancakes were so soggy in the middle that they kind of congealed together everyone s breakfast sausage was dry and bland for specializing in pancakes and being known for their breakfast dishes this place sucked i won t be spending my money here again ever
  the service was fast and friendly the food was fast fresh and yummy we got chicken satay chicken yellow curry and duck fried rice we were in and out in under 30 min parking was easy to find great dive
  love the place but wished it was somewhere else the place has a very old school vegas feel to it dim light maroon leather booths green walls very intimate food was fantastic service was spectacular and wine selection was outstanding a classic vegas place that is a must check out to have a vintage vegas experience dont let the fact that it is in circus circus dissuade you it is definitely worth the trip
  how does this chain place still retain such a local feel allow me to count the ways the people working here try talking to me in spanish i applaud the effort and then abruptly stop when i give them my i don t understand look each store is set up a little differently meaning some locations look grungier than others the inconsistency of the food makes you believe they are actually cooking there is no dollar menu volcano taco or mascot to promote their food overall roberto s deserves a 3 5 star but i have to round them down even though they ve filled my belly many a time in the wee hours of the night since the stuff i order is totally greasy and unhealthy and my heart just won t allow to give them four thump thump thump thump
  we came here for nye 13 dinner about halfway through our dinner a country folk band started performing extremely depressing songs not my idea of new years cheer the food was awesome i loved every bite of it our waitress asked us to order the specials since they were competing to sell the most i thought that was unprofessional and uncomfortable all four of us ended up getting a special but not because she had requested it the ribs were to die for the meat was tender and the truffles mushrooms were cooked well i don t know if this special will be offered again but if it is i highly recommend it minus a star because they won t make an irish coffee my bf ordered one and they would only serve him one of their fancy drinks how hard is it to put whisky into coffee at a restaurant with a bar
  my wife and i love the chips salsa at this place the food is simply awesome and really delicious but folks if your in the mood for a light snack you cant go wrong with a margarita from here the chips salsa it s really awesome
  lunch salmon piccatta with lemon butter all the way best value for money and so delicious
  another of my favorites they have a great happy hour with small plates for 5 ea at the bar i a particularly fond of the beef tenderloin with brie served on small slices of toast and the house salad the restaurant itself is very not phoenix big plush bars dark room roaring fire when you are in the rokeril you can forget that it is a seething inferno outside the only reason that i am giving them a 4 instead of a 5 is that their cuts of meat seem to be fattier than i am accustomed to my so and i have noticed this with both beef and lamb cuts overall a fantastic dining experience though and we are both always happy to diner here
  this place is amazing the service is great our meal was so yummy and good the vie is a plus
  disappointed had the shrimp burrito lots of rice very little shrimp
  came friday in early evening honestly this is tasty food but the place is extremely crowded and loud i am not a poutine expert but can t believe the poutine would be vastly better here than elsewhere if you want a real boisterous experience then this is a great choice otherwise i d look elsewhere
  excellent neighborhood hang out place love the sunday half off steak great service
  great food and cozy atmosphere its authentic italian i always enjoy eating here whether i m dressed up or not they make me feel at home you need to have reservations though if it is a busy night but it is worth calling ahead for it is especially nice when lois is working she makes everyone feel like family
  i can t tell you enough how much i love this place i love the scenery it s like you re not in phoenix anymore the farm has three places to eat i am more of a picnic girl specifically because i know i can get sweet potato salad and a portobello sandwich and frolick in the grass okay so i don t frolick but i do sit on a cute bench everytime i m there they have a new soup it s like a birthday present midweek i swear the weddings are beautiful there and morning glory is good for company in town
  if you love real spicy chinese food this is the place see the reviewer jenny c s reivew she hits the nail on the head and like her i only go for the sichuan food not the american chinese food if you re not familiar it s all about chili peppers and tongue numbing peppercorns the sichuan menu is pretty robust and while i can t help but order dry fried chicken i really love the mala the cumin beef and the fish there are a few things i ve yet to try but it will happen i really respect the fact that they don t offer a 1 10 scale or any such thing if there are 3 chili peppers then the dish is really really really spicy either order it or not i also tip my hat and tip monitarily the waitresses they hustle not only serving but bussing in a very busy restaurant they don t miss a beat they don t get your order wrong they don t forget to refill your water they bring your check when you re done without having to ask be wary of going on weekends at lunch and dinner it gets really busy and you may have to wait for a table
  hands down best burger you ll ever eat this place is a must try you won t be sorry
  great service and food i m a nyker that moved to the valley of the sun less than a year ago and finding good food here is hard i live in north phx and everything here is chain restaurants or food badly made i went in with low expectations but was pleasantly surprise by their staff food choices prices and great service i have visited this place three times already and am planning to become a regular
  love the friendliness great food
  great restaurant no awesome place to find a cure for constipation abso friggin lutely get a 5 buck box wait 2 hours and let the good times flow right out of your rectum like greased lightning also if you like dating big nasties that work at taco bell this place is the spot to be on the upside they are generally nice and usually get your order right
  service is great always accommodating our big group love the kenny roll tried the johnny no rice roll rolled with cucumber omg sooo good we have been here 3 times and each time the service got better we had a birthday cake and forgot a knife they helped with that they took pictures for us they speed or cake for us and all with a smile rolls came out quick for a group of 15 we will be back for sure
  the brunch food is just plain ol good french food i ll find anywhere on the streets of orange county i m so glad i chose to eat here instead of an infamous buffet same cost but less evil on the body the wait to sit outside is about 5 times that of sitting indoors actually we didn t have to wait at all for a table inside but the atmosphere is calm and soothing the food i m sure is just as great the whipped cream from the blueberry pancakes is to die for i dipped everything in there at least once even my eggs benedict if you re with a group of girls and don t feel like binging start the day out here and you won t regret
  we came at 5 30 on a tuesday evening and we were the only customers at the time our waitress was very attentive and friendly but spoke very little english the restaurant is rather small but nicely decorated it is north of a walgreens pharmacy and just south of the mcdonalds and directly across the street from a subway and a tattoo shop on alma school rd we ordered off of both the regular and the chinese menu started with fried potstickers juicy large and flavorful next came pork egg fu yong which had a nice flavor and lots of pork piled on top but some how was very difficult to cut and twice cooked pork which had a lot of tender very thin slices of pork onions red hot little peppers some ginger and other chinese veggies although i asked for it to be spicy it had little heat to it the fortune cookies were quite fresh sweet and crispy i have taken away a star from the food the very friendly owner chef came out to see how we liked the food and with his very broken english promised he would make some wonderful dishes for us next time we will probably return to try some other menu items
  i ve been to every firefly location in town this particular location in the summerlin area i ve been to a couple of times and the service really wasn t all that great i do love everything i ve tried on the menu which is a good handful of items i cannot say anything bad about the food on a positive note personal favorites are the firefly fries crispy and served with shredded parmesan cheeses and really good dipping sauce delicate little bacon wrapped dates spicy beef salad calamari tomato soup sliders chicken skewers empanadas and a few others at every location the food is similarly presented every time and is absolutely delicious the prices are a little high for tapas but a few options shared will still leave everyone with a full and happy belly the one thing you always have to get when you come with a group of friends is a pitcher of sangria or the passion fruit mojitos so yummy the service at this particular location however is another story it has never really been outstanding first of all the hostesses were not pleasant and did not really appear like they wanted to be working there our waiter was hardly that friendly and did not return once to our table to check up on us and see how we were doing when we had dined there for about two hours the busser was not very nice either she came a few times to see if we were done with our plates when i was clearly still eating and when i told her that she seemed really annoyed we asked for another serving of bread to go with our cheese fondue dish and she forgot about that since our waiter never came back once i had to track him down in order for us to get a chance to order some of the nutella crepe dessert that they have i think waitstaff is pretty important they make a big part of the dining experience and contribute to the ambiance of the place i am not trying to bag on this restaurant at all because i know i ll be back for the food but i sure hope i ll get waited by people who know what impeccable customer service is like next time
  so i have been to plenty of smash burgers and i can say they are all consistent i have never been to one that was better or worse when it comes to food where they change is in service and cleanliness this one was not that busy but had several dirty tables and some that had been wiped down were not wiped well i still they there burgers are better than 5 guys but 5 guys have better fries i think their shakes are good here as well
  staff is always friendly this location is always packed and there is usually a wait to get in
  best fast burger in town
  for a while i was addicted to this place and would walk for 30mins just to get my shawarma fix the meat were fresh and plentiful the people were friendly and the garlic sauce was exceptional
  best chinese food in surprise and very friendly environment
  i love old school vegas places so i ve obviously had hugo s bookmarked for a while and finally visited last night first the setting downtown in the 4 queens so you get the full vintage feeling that i think is kinda lacking at piero s or golden steer of course the four queens has pretty much moved beyond vintage to dated and smoky so luckily the restaurant is located literally in the cellar away from the nastiness of the casino second the ambiance all brick walls with old paintings everywhere the furniture is newer but definitely not modern i think they could probably spruce things up a little without losing the feel of the place for instance 1970s glass lamp shades shaped like flowers third the service perfect friendly prompt knowledgeable all over it with our water refills and busing our dirty plates but i never felt like they were hovering i loved that the sommelier came around to chat with everybody and he was great very approachable explained things to us without being snooty and definitely did not scoff at our price point i love love love that the sommelier has been there almost 30 years the busser 15 years and the waiter 15 years fourth the food great we started with the escargot which were rich and buttery just like they should be we each had an order of 6 but i wished we would have split because i was already getting full moved on to the salad which many people have described it might be nice if one of the offerings was just make me a caesar salad but i appreciated all the options all the ingredients were fresh and plentiful for entrees we had the sea bass new england style and the beef wellington both were delicious but i thought the wellington really stood out both the beef and the pastry were cooked perfectly and the sauce added the perfect flavor also the meat was so tender not a bit stringy like i expected finally topped it off with the chocolate dipped fruits which were a nice tough it was so much food and we didn t even touch the bread basket that we each brought home at least half of our entree finally the damage 250 fine dining salads appetizers entrees mini desserts a bottle of wine and tip totally worth it i wouldn t mind stopping back by for a martini at the bar when i m in the area sometime
  everything was fresh and cooked to order and thank you for being a chicken strip place that isn t scared to leave em in the fryer for a little bit to get extra crispy the fries were great too not too much salt also cooked to order you can get a 3 tender meal with fries for under 10 so it s a clutch lunch spot or for a late night snack
  i miss coming here i moved from az and this is almost worth the plane trip in itself for these raw goodies everything is made fresh in house you won t find corn syrup or sodas or gmo products instead you will find organic vegan and raw selections that won t make you feel you are sacrificing taste for healthy when i m visiting az this is the first place i want to eat at everything here is delicious and while the menu does keep a few classics it also rotates with fresh soups of the day desserts and juices to keep new tempting offerings to chose from and my taste buds wanting more
  took my son here for lunch last week it was his first experience at biaggio s pizza we ordered a large meatlover s pizza see pics we patiently waited for it to be prepared and sat in the dining area and chatted with biaggio for a few minutes he s a really nice guy who enjoys his business our pizza came out after a short wait and we devoured it within minutes it is as good as i remembered my son couldn t stop talking about it i wish we lived nearby so we could come more often overall it s one of the best pizza joints in town return factor 99
  brio s is a lovely italian restaurant in the south park area as expected the restaurant is beautiful i set outside on the patio i was quickly seated and had a very attentive server i ordered the vegetable panini which was very delicious and was also a pretty decent size amount considering the price it also came with a quinoa side salad overall i would say this place is worth a try its nothing super special but the food is not bad either i d say about average
  we went to this buffet for sunday brunch and it was terrible service was bad food was bad overall experience was bad the only good part of this buffet was the chocolate fountain i wanted to dip some banana pieces in the fountain but even those were brown save your money eat somewhere else
  my whole family and i love this place you walk in sit whenever you d like or you can make a togo order the staff is always friendly and accommodating they have old 6 packs on the table that house their condiments and hold up their paper menus this is a very laid back no frills place which is great when you just want to be casual i always order the chicago dog with a hot link and the clam strips with wasabi ranch so awesome this is a family owned place so you will see pretty much the same faces everytime you come in they have beer on draft and even rootbeer on draft if you haven t been i suggest you go love this place
  so this place is a korean owned japanese restaurant i guess it doesn t matter as long as they know how to make the food right the hubs went to order as the boy and i sat at a table the hubs and the guy at the register hit it off and did some small talk he was really friendly we ordered 2 of the ramen noodle bowls it took about 15 20 before they came out the bowl was just okay nothing too tasty and a little bland i wish they didn t have the wooden chopsticks that you break apart to eat the ramen it definitely didn t make the ramen taste any better we will come back and try out the sushi next time and who knows maybe their ramen will be better too it s a new place so we ll give it another try
  first time i went here i set the bar low and this place hurdled it easily this time i had the bar set high after my first experience and it still crushed it hands down best restaurant in arizona only 5 star restaurant and its obvious the martinis whoa think matthew mccanaughy from wolf of wall st and just keep them coming
  service was slow food was tasteless and it was very expensive for what you got would not go back if you see this place keep walking it s not worth it
  food was good but i was embarrassed that the portions were sooo big definitely take home and make multiple meals
  gimmicky as far as the lobsicle and bisque avoid the lobsicle was tasty but was tiny not worth the the bisque was watered down ive had better bisque from costco
  2 stars for having to wait to be served wondering if we were forgotten and for not seating people well at tables which increases the wait time before you sit 6 stars for some of the best authentic delicious hearty amazing pizza i ve had in a while while my family was bummed that we didn t get a real brunch since delucca s and pamela s were ridiculously long wait times the awesomeness of this pizza mediterranean style 4 stars
  i m a fan of the grand lux and actually had a dinner party here several years ago it is of course owned by the cheesecake factory so if you like their cuisine then you will be in for a similar treat this place could easily be a 4 or 5 star place for a casual nice eatery but it seems as if they try to turn some of their food into the food of a much more upscale establishment this isnt bad necessarily but its often executed not quite as great as they probably hope maybe i m too simple but when i order a salad i expect to be able to eat lettuce their caesar is large leaf lettuce nestled onto each other with sparse dressing and two pieces of cheese and no croutons really really its a salad cut me some slack plus their food isn t as flavorful as cheesecake factory which i dont consider their food super seasoned soooo its hit or miss but generally not bad id go again but i wont go out of my way to return
  this is our favorite local restaurant we ve been coming here for dinners and a mother s day brunch since mid 2009 when i found it on yelp it s in a nondescript shopping center and if not for the constant traffic jam outside you probably wouldn t even notice it i particularly like the lighting inside the restaurant it s very relaxed and seems classier than it should be given the location the burger is great but the chicken sandwich is easily the best i ve had i also enjoy the pcg pasta and they have a lot of great beers on tap we live in chandler now but i ll make the drive to pcg any time i get an opportunity
  i love this place it s a great place to chill play some life size social games grab a drink and even eat it s 24 7 great place for a chill date or hanging with friends life size beer pong corn hole and shuffleboard to name a few if you are in downtown come here
  this is my first proper midwestern meal in a midwestern town i was meeting a friend for dinner and she recommended here as my debut into the cuisine of madison indeed the old fashioned achieved that admirably the beer selection was capacious and i had cheese curds that i believe to be both delicious and probably authentic i ordered the old fashioned burger beef patty crunchy bacon veggies an egg on top but i had requested medium rare and it came more like a medium well done also the fries on the side were somewhat soft and tasteless i would peg this institution more as a social gathering place where a group of friends share a beer instead of a wholehearted restaurant dedicated to the art of fine food
  solid breakfast the service is great 15 minute wait was more like 10 minutes try the vanilla waffle super fluffy and solid flavor but really big overall good place to get breakfast on the strip
  came back two years later and with no customers in there the lady still took 5 mins to greet us then we were greeted by what what you looking for lmao how is this place still in business we walked right out what a p o s
  you know i ve seen this place showcased on food network about 5 times in the span of 5 years or so and it looked delicious so during prego 2012 the wife we went on our last trip prior to ava being born to cleveland ohio i already know relax so we spontaneously map the drive to pittsburgh cause we re just wingin this shit drove 2 1 2 hours and wow were we disappointed i know we sort of set ourselves up for disappointment by driving over a hour with lofty expectations but oh well we do what we do how can you go wrong with pastrami coleslaw fries on italian bread the entire thing needed more flavor some au jus maybe some salt maybe on tv it looked like salt punch from the pastrami or corned beef the starch and salt from the natural cut fries and italian bread is the pinnacle of bread for me would be a perfect marriage but come to find out it s just a standard marriage with room for improvement not ours dear i wanted to love this place so much hopefully it gets better all in all a great place to stop by for the nostalgia and what not but don t get your hopes and expectations in the way
  food is always decent to good always fresh and clean good taste with better quality ingredients a nice change from any fast food or the run of th mill greasy sppon joint healthier options and all around ok
  they ve changed their chicken tikka masala recipe at least twice since my original review and each time i ve liked it less the sauce used to be creamy now it looks like there s no cream in it and it separates easily so the fat floats on the top i ll have to find another restaurant to sate my chicken tikka cravings
  i don t know what is wrong with my wife but she has the worst experiences when eating burgers at burger joints strange while she may not have enjoyed herself i certainly did i had the magic mushroom burger and despite some of the magic missing it was still great tons of onions and lots of mushrooms made for a wicked good burger the fries weren t bad either but i wish they didn t serve them in a paper bag seriously for 5 you can t beat the combo deal much love to the hippies can t wait to see how the breakfast joint turns out
  i really enjoy their happy hour good drinks and good food what more can you ask for karaoke night is fun and very entertaining lol
  had dinner and appts last night was really nice the service was fantastic had a combo sushi appetizer of salmon tuna halibut that was delicious with a glass of champagne very nice experience over all
  still amazing i suggest getting a fried egg on whatever sandwich you get i dont remember what i said in my last review as far as sides but you need to get the beans if you are really hungry you could probably deal with a second side in which case i usually go with fries but i ll leave that decision up to you just promise me you will get the beans they are after all the magical fruit i love this place every time i am in town i never leave without going here
  my favorite italian restaurant in phoenix i never had a bad meal the chef is remarkable in his preparation one of my favorite dishes is the chipino crazy good on a cold day we order the spaghetti and meatball extra ball on a regular basis the antipasto salad is the best i ever had not much of a pizza guy so i won t comment on that since i never had one there but they come out of the kitchen like salmon swimming to spawn they have a bar that is conveniently placed to accommodate you with a cold beer while you wait for takeout i ve eaten at the bar a few times always a lively and friendly crowd
  pleasantly surprised i discovered alihan s while visiting pittsburgh for work and walking around downtown looking for a good lunch spot i love middle eastern mediterranean cuisine and this place caught my eye as i got closer to the entrance there was a lunch menu posted which incuded 6 lunch specials for 10 each there are several meat options to include chicken lamb beef there is also a vegetarian option i opted for the chicken shish which was accompanied with my choice of wheat bulgur fries or rice i opted for the bulgur my choice of soft drink was also included in the special there was a longer wait for the food than i anticipated maybe 20 minutes but once the food arrived i determined it was well worth the wait my meal consisted of 3 large chunks of grilled well seasoned chicken placed between 2 halves of delicious flatbread with a side of shredded lettuce chopped tomatoes and grilled bell pepper strips there was a generous portion of wheat bulgur which was positively yummy i didn t know what to expect whether the side dish would be hot cold seasoned etc the dish was served warm with an assortment of veggies and seasoned nicely the bulgur was great accompaniment to the other components of the meal there was also a side of house made tzatiki sauce this was a very good meal and a great value for just 10 i would definitely return for lunch and would also like to try the more expansive dinner menu as well
  this location is now closed unfortunate really enjoyed closest is now at tempe marketpkace
  the borscht is really good really unique don t know anywhere else in waterloo that even makes borscht the perogies were really good too and the owner gave us extra she is really nice amazing service and we were treated kindly given extra bread and sour cream when we needed it etc never had napoleon cake before and it was dope would absolutely recommend it s a really cozy and personal spot
  ate here on a recent overnight visit for work got serveral pounds of crawfish in hot and spicy i wasn t too impressed the sauce was good but the crawfish were kinda dried up and weren t juicy or slurpy at all sausage corn etc is all good we also got a couple lobsters at market price i wasn t paying so i didn t see the bill the lobsters were good better quality than the crawfish overall i can t say that this place blew me out of the water if i m up for something different then maybe this is really a 2 star review but i m giving them 3 cause their servers are great eye candy
  i freakin love this place tiny quaint and good for a date spring rolls and they are on happy hour the veggie one with the mango is my fav veg friendly sit at the bar and the cute red head will make you house shots
  i like coming here when i want some peace and quiet after hofbrauhaus it s very spacious with plenty of seating so we are always able to grab our favorite table in the back room once the place was crowded probably because the wait to get into hofbrauhaus was ridiculous but last weekend it was relatively empty with groups of people scattered about nice selection of beers though nothing that s super hard to find at another bar with a decent selection had harp strongbow etc as a bitch i get excited about their bitch drinks great chocolate martini and buttercup of course pricey for the quantity that you get 6 ish buttercup was more worth its price though had their spinach dip with pitas tasty when you seat yourself on a saturday night sometimes the wait staff will notice you and come over sometimes they don t either way it s fine since we re ok with walking to the bar to order drinks this place tries hard to be irish with the irish style roadsigns and guinness things on the walls after spending some solid hours at this place i began to think that their music collection consists solely of rock band soundtracks not that this is a bad thing but some irish songs once in a while would be interesting it also goes without being said that american sports are shown on the tvs but whatever the atmosphere is not as loud as that of a real irish pub and is more like an american sports bar with an irish theme this is actually a good place for drinking in peace rather than getting your irish on
  i can t believe i live this close and we have never been here price value and selection nobody even comes close fyi when you order the hummus one plate is good enough for 2 3 people comparing the hummus is better than at sammy s woodfire pizza which is okay to get my fix and ali babba in san diego the bread is more generous here but sammy s is better i have ate at alot of arabic restaurants so i used the places that have i like best to compare it too the tabouli is off the chain so good which is just opposite to palms casino buffet which carries alot of arabic food that borders lines offensive and is gross
  atmosphere vibe food and especially the drinks all great i had the steak and it was great this place is 30 mins from my place but i drive down to get the upstate gentleman great drink the value is great for the quality and service here this is what is call a no brainer it s gotta be in your top 3 or 4 if you live in the area
  i was excited to see this place i have been to other places with the same concept and was expecting something better i must say it was a let down the place looks like a joes crab shack the server was polite and friendly but walking into that place was walking into a morgue dead and dead with a lot of tvs and none on the vibe was dry and when i got my 1 pound of shrimp hot well it was disappointing people wrote how hot and how it burns well it did but the taste was of chill powder and cayanne the flavor was not infused and just tasted bland the tots were very good and i must say a highlight of the place i will never come back but it does have potential and with music might be fun with some ambiance it would rock food needs more time to allow flavor to sink in i wish it the best
  super delicious i had the monterrey and it was awesome at first when my wife told me about this place i was skeptical breakfast food in a crepe well i was very happy i went my crepe had bacon eggs mild serranos jack cheese and a tomato blend i paid 75 cents and had a half of a sliced avocado placed on top i miss my texas breakfast tacos and this is as close as i can get plus mimosas sampler will definitely eat here again
  ate in the lounge where you can only order appetizers all i can say is that if the abundance of an appetizer is that large that i can imagine eating a full meal took some friends from out of town and sat by the fireside and orders sliders didn t care for the cole slaw wings were wonderful and good size and small nachos the nachos had that cheese that doesn t melt and was the only reason why i couldn t give 5 stars the atmosphere is very relaxing and the servers were very knowledgable
  about 15 years ago i would stop in here to grab breakfast before heading to work a couple times a week i have noticed for sometime now that dima s tacos is still in business so i made a point to come in for breakfast to see if it was like i had remembered inside is small with only maybe 4 or 5 tables the woman who took my order was nice and gave me time to look over the menu she also told me that they were not the original owners of dima s and that it has changed hands over the years her and her husband recently started a lease so anybody familiar with dima s tacos before might notice a difference in the menu and prices since it had been so long since my last visit i just hoped for good food the prices are fair depending on what you order some menu items are made fresh and other stuff isn t my total was around 11 agua fresca this wasn t made fresh and came from a fountain machine it also tasted watered down cheese quesadilla good size and really the only thing i enjoyed it s kind of hard to mess up a cheese quesadilla bacon breakfast burrito i knew it was not going to be like i remembered dima s being all those years ago but wow it really wasn t the same the burritos used to be really big double wrapped and now they are long and skinny i don y mind since they use really big tortillas and it still ends up being a decent size the scrambled eggs were not mixed all the way before being made so i ended up with a white and yellow scramble not good there was only 2 or 3 small pieces of potato in the center and that s it the burrito could have definitely used more potato i also paid for extra cheese to be added and there was none at all the bacon tasted good but was hard at times
  i belong to a fairly large network group that comes here for breakfast every wednesday morning we have the back room for our use i ve always been happy with everything i ve ordered here i pretty much stick to the same breakfast every time and our designated server jacque who always knows what the regulars want she is amazing has the biggest heart and cares about all of her customers she has been serving the group for over 15 years and we all love her
  ate here while staying at the circus circus hotel mitch our waiter was both very knowledgable and helpful the food was on par with a restaurant of this stature but i will admit i ve had nearly as good of a prime rib at other less expensive restaurants like texas roadhouse the real value in this place is the fact that it isn t ala carte like so many restaurants in this category my bake potato came with a heaping side of bacon butter sour cream and chives which was plenty more than i needed my only real gripe is that their appetizers were seafood only which i did not care for if you are staying at the circus circus there is a coupon for a free bottle of wine at this restaurant but keep in mind the bottle they give you with this coupon retails for 5 39 at a wine store but hey it s free overall a nice steak restaurant worth going to on the strip if you have never been
  the atmosphere here is very inviting airy and open i was greeted promptly and seated right away the menu is physically large while being surprisingly limited the seafood choices are quite small actually fresh chips very light and not greasy were served hot and with three different salsas none of them are hot the habanero was disappointingly mild but your tastes may be different i ordered the vegetarian fajitas be warned the rice that is served with them is cooked in chicken stock so ask for white rice if you are a vegetarian the fajitas were very undercooked essentially just absolutely raw veggies on a hot plate i sent them back for a bit more cooking and the arrived quickly cooked properly everyone makes mistakes the tortillas were fresh and tasted good overall a good experience
  first off when you first approach the building you get the glorious smell of the smoker which is located outside if the smell wasn t inviting enough then the food will be i enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich topped with slaw of course my husband had the 2 meat combo with pulled pork brisket bbq beans and potato salad to top off our meal we had the pecan praline pudding so delicious our experience was great the staff was friendly and personable everyone greeted us upon arrival and departure as well as chatting with us before we left a major plus is it has a low key mom and pop feel the ambiance is relaxed you don t always find good ol comfort food in this big city we will definitely be back
  i know thai food and am a huge fan and this place rocks perfect flavors consistency and spice level we ordered a spice level of 10 of 10 which was perfect not too spicy the ambience is very calming and the service is top notch it is a little bit of a drive from the strip but totally worth it will be back again for sure one note they have a lot of veggie options so vegetarians rejoice
  normally have no complaints about this location but today was an almost total fail cashier wasnt friendly i was hoping to get a bag of ice and for some reason they arent able to sell ice right now so i ordered a cherry blue raspberry nerds slushie and so the problems begin first no nerds so thanks for having me pay for a product i didnt get 2nd it didnt taste like i was expecting yes it was purple which red and blue make purple so i had my partner taste it without telling him what flavor it was supposed to be and he said grape cherry and blue raspberry dont taste anything like grape s i also paid for the extra flavor that i obviously didnt get the cashier was just plain not friendly seemed like we were bothering her she handed us our drinks and said here ya go i said thank you and she just kinda looked at me so i said have a good day and then she responded while have a good one the only bright spot was the peanut butter fudge master shake my partner got said it was delicious i normally go through at least once a week for happy hour and never had any issues so thats what makes todays visit such a shock
  i decided to try this place because i d never had it and it was close to my house i was soo looking forward to some tasty shrimp and broc that is not what i got it was awful so much so that i barely ate any of it i feel like i wasted my money i will definitely not be ordering from there again
  tuesday is opposite day or is it thursday i don t know anymore i m bored with reviewing at the moment so i m going to write this as exactly the opposite of how i actually feel save for the star rating which i will rate accurately so i don t mess up the average i ll let you do the decoding delux is awful i hate that they have arrogant bastard on tap their cheeseburgers are a huge step down from applebees my personal favorite or maybe tgifridays is my favorite life is full of such difficult decisions anyway the french fries at delux remind me of deep friend cardboard flavorless and tough when my server accidentally spilled an inconsequential amount of fry sauce on my twenty dollar jeans he didn t give me 30 off oh and i hate the decor too i m not already planning to eat here this coming weekend
  we ve eaten here many times the wait staff and excellent attentive and the food is always top notch the ambiance is cool and date appropriate
  mediocre quality ingredients all farmed fish and grain fed beef the foods in the dishes just didn t really meld together and the plates that came out all had some differences from how they were listed on the menu the staff was very good the place was clean and the service was fine all the negatives lie with the food overall i wouldn t come here again had the cobb salad and the swordfish special with bacon and spinach the dressing on this salad was just terrible it was okay on its own but combined with the rest of the salad the flavors just did not work well together at all the swordfish was eh the bacon and spinach were a disappointment i have high expectations of bacon the spinach had a poor texture and flavor
  my hubby and i decided to make a quick stop somewhere to take a restroom break and of course to get something to snack on before heading back on the road to la we ve never heard of culver s so we took a chance on it since it was off the freeway it looks like a brand new location since it looks so new from the outside we find out it s a ice cream type of place with burgers and fries their sign says their known for their frozen custard which sounded pretty darn yummy despite the fact that it s so cold outside so we went in and the customer service was pretty good the young ladies would ask if we were ready to place our order and once we told her not yet she told us to take our time their interior was pretty nice and clean as well as their restroom their menu selection consisted of lots of burgers and frozen custard treats and milkshakes we ended up getting one strawberry milkshake and one brownie batter item the milkshake was pretty darn good the brownie batter was good too but i enjoyed the milkshake a lil better so if you re looking for a good fast food sweets place if you re in az be sure to check out culver s
  the people here are so nice my mom and i had the champong and jajang myun both good and inexpensive
  love love love the carpaccio never had anything else and don t want to you will not be disappointed
  i ve been here for football game brunches and for late night beers with friends and i ve always had a great experience the offer an amazing variety of beer and have decent quality food for a pub i would describe this pub as chill it not big as such but that s what gives it a very comfortable feel the nights when live music is played are the best one is more than happy sipping beer and smiling
  wow a burger what service 1st time i dined inside staff and management were superb i was in awe i don t even know what i ate they really cheered up my mood and day thanks wab
  so after the communication from management we gave wildflower another try mcclintock guatalupe the ladies at the counter were really friendly and helped us make the most of our order they obviously enjoy working with the public we ordered the hummus plate kid s linguine with pesto on the side the turkey brie sandwich an of course our son had a giant pretzel the hummus plate was great but the turkey brie was fantastic we really enjoyed our meal the best part were the four little pumpkin pie bites they brought to us i only got a tiny bite they were so good the kids gobbled them up pardon the thanksgiving pun couldn t resist the restaurant was clean with plenty of room to navigate with children the staff was friendly and in a great mood every one of them thanks for a great pre movie family meal
  wow what a great restaurant the gucamole here is absolubly crazy if you love avocado plates that have it are a must try
  i love this place the food is amazing and the service was wonderful we ordered breakfast poach egg panini cheese croissant and a butter croissant all really delicious we will revisit again when we are in montreal
  if i could give less than i would the portions were adequate but i would actually like to have some meat with my green chili taste was mediocre and i even tried breakfast with great dissapointed i m so glad the la pinata open up across the street not to mention mucho macho taco was just as dissapointing
  very stylish restaurant and bar i prefer to have drinks here or lunch dinner can be a little disappointing overall a good place to drink but would suggest eating elsewhere
  my go to place for dinner lunch or even breakfast when i go to vegas amazing prices home cooked quality meals their open 24 7 a steak meal is 9 99 comes with 2 sides a salad or soup and beer great staff as well love u ellis island
  so i have to update that while i still love some of what the spot has to offer i am sad to say that the food quality isn t as consistent as it used to be the menu has some great offerings and wonderful flavors they just don t pay quite the attention to detail that they used to for the price points they have the quality should be on point in my initial review i suggested that joe s farm grill had some new competition in town i must say that is not the case anymore the bacon used to be so crisp and now it is limp and greasy the steak sandwich once full of great cuts of meat is now met with gross amounts of fat and grizzle i will still continue to eat here as they still have some items that are usually consistent another thing that they have going for them is that they are excellent about replacing your order if you are unhappy i am hoping to see the spot make a comeback as the food they were serving when they first opened was amazing
  they do an excellent imitation of meat fish items tastes almost like real meat fish for someone like me who relatively new to veganism this is very helpful the prices are quite reasonable too given that most vegan places are usually significantly costlier
  dishes are pretty good although they tend to have more fat on their meat dishes but still decent my main complaint is most of servers have big time attitude especially the son of the owner young guy there is absolutely zero customer service in this restaurant being nice and friendly are something that they can not provide to all their customers they are probably not being treated well or maybe they are arrogant about the fact that they are the only decent filipino restaurant in the nw part of the valley
  no wait for lunch on a saturday impressive the best thing i ate here was the pho not to sound crazy but it was the best most delicious pho i have ever tried in lost wages haha but in all seriousness the buffet tasted way better this time than the first time i went in september of 2012 the desserts gelato dim sum crab legs and sushi are my go to dishes the meats and assortment of sausages were good honestly there are so many choices it s impossible to eat and try everything which is a great reason why you have to try bacchanal more than once
  the size amount and flavor of the falafels were large and delicious the salad greens should gave more chopped and less vinaigrette added however i have hadgreek food for more than 25 years and this is this best fresh tzaziki sauce i have ever had
  very good sushi but not my favorite in the valley by any means i will probably be going back in the future though at some point
  truly exceptional plate by plate chef chris is sure to delight your palette with his fantastic flavors and fresh ingredients go there just not on the days i want to go back i don t need you getting in my way
  yes the service is slow but the food is fantastic i say this while eating leftovers for breakfast so yummy great cheese selection awesome jam packed menu cool drink list i had the cheese garlic and tomato lavosh pizza i can t remember the name yum yum i put some avocado on it for breakfast this morning and it was killer go here have a snack first brush off the waitstaff because they seemed to get friendlier and friendlier as the night went on yum
  had the pastrami reuben with no cheese the sandwich was absolutely amazing i got the potato salad also that was also awesome great taste to it and i topped off the meal with a black white cookie really good nice and soft if you want a quick bite with really good food stop here i just found my new vegas sandwich shop
  i have been coming here since 1995 when i first moved to las vegas i love the deep dish chicago pizza just picked up a deep dish chicago pizza and it was delicious tim the new kitchen manager has maintained the famous rosati s sauce and crust and after coming here for now unbelievable 19 years it s comfort food at its best
  no need to discuss the food just like every other chain steak house in town or the country for that matter what makes the palm unique however is the staff s uncanny ability to act like they are doing you a favor by letting you come spend your money in their restaurant as a result of the non descript food and snotty staff we now avoid imposing on them if you want a nice dinner at a nice steakhouse go to macintosh s the food is better it is not a chain and the staff is glad you came in
  this show seems to have a little bit of an identity crisis the show was lacking in energy and did not seem to have a narrative or a point it just seemed like they did not want to be there sometimes like why is there a gloria estefan song and then an elvis song and then a glow stick dance also the description for the show says to the beats of the black eyed peas and that part was missing just why was any of it happening to as part of a luau wow but also called island heat so are they referring to cuba as an island hence the gloria estefan song i am just making this assumption because there is really no other indication for it maybe the hostess lady said something about it but the sounds is really loud and she did not enunciate very well so i may have missed something i also understand that they cannot use real fire in the show but they use glow sticks instead during certain parts but maybe they could explain that and then maybe add some reasons why it is important for certain cultures to incorporate fire into their ritualistic dance just a suggestion because honestly this show just seemed like a string of dances and musical numbers with no real tie in kind of like a talent show the dinner was very meh i liked the beginning salad and i opted for the mahi mahi yikes it was bland and over cooked it came with a side of bland rice and over steamed baby bok choy there was a little pile of mango salsa that i parceled out to try and make it tastier overall i would not recommend the show at this point it could be that they are in transition because this shows kind of seems like it is it needs a production overhaul to make it more interesting especially in the extremely competitive market of strip shows
  we stayed over in pittsburg on drive home and thanks to yelp found this place boy oh boy am i glad i have yelp this is one of the top 5 breakfasts i ve ever had i had tex mex omelette with chorizo and it was awesome son had chocolate chip and banana hot cakes and it was even better and i m not a sweet breakfast eater the chocolate was not too sweet which made for a great match with the bananas no syrup necessary i will definitely return on next trip to area may even make up a reason to come back just for pamela s there wasn t a breakfast over 7 we went tuesday at 1pm and were sat right away
  so i m stuck here for work for a week and found this nice pub not exactly my scene but the wait staff was super friendly and suggested better spots for me to check out beer selection was pretty typical and drink prices were pretty cheap considering i live in ny next time i ll try the food
  i m always rooting for coffee shops that aren t starbucks i would rather put my money into keeping quaint shops with a friendly staff in business jolta s joltacchino s are perfectly done i love the fact that they aren t frothy or watered down i have made relationships with the staff because they remind me of my favorite midwestern baristas i ve also had jolta s sandwiches and my experiences have all been positive it s always a battle between press and jolta my coffee shops away from home 4 stars bravo
  expensive food in small amount service average to poor despite the prices decor ok i was surprised at how pedestrian this restaurant is in view of the reputation of the chef i was not even impressed by desserts which i read were excellent another typical strip restaurant in las vegas more hype than value and quality of my three times there the dinner service at the bar one late night was especially bad
  don t get me wrong i love glaziers please note that this review is specifically for the steaks that are on sale they have wonderful sale items but the last few times that i bought steaks that were on sale it wasn t very tasty as a matter of fact it seemed old and tainted i don t think i will be buying any steaks here that are on sale
  great food great people great fun this place has a great atmosphere with very attentive staff and the food is cheap but doesn t skimp on quality try the philadelphia cheese steak it is amazing
  i can start by saying that this restaurant really surprised us in a great way you would never think that great food would actually come out of this place i mean it s super far from where i live let s get to the food recommended from my co worker who actually works here at night and was our server we thank you drew chutoro nigiri medium fatty tuna 4 5 actually really good i kind of only wish it was garlic ponzu sauce but very fresh albacore tataki 4 5 great flavor and i wanted like another 3 orders of this lol kumamoto oysters 5 5 so good my favorite thing tuna cocktail 5 5 the display was something amazing they put some dry ice in the liquid and the cup was smoking and the tuna was delicious spider roll and crunchy eel 4 5 really good rolls the great thing about this place is the crab they use in the rolls is snow crab great flavor only thing i can say is i wanted more eel and soft shell crab in my rolls spicy edamame 3 5 not bad not the best either sea urchin uni nigiri 5 5 super fresh hamachi kama 4 5 prepared really well and tasted great and the skin on the outside was crispy enough to eat stone places don t prepare this right but this was good salmon skin hand roll 3 5 this was probably my last favorite thing i mean don t get me wrong i ate it all and it tasted great but the bonito flakes that we re stuffed in here didn t make it awesome i would suggest a little eel sauce and less bonito thank you fried banana and chocolate lava cake dessert 5 5 this dessert was amazing it was simple with this salted caramel gelato the combo was awesome overall this is a great place if you want to bring your significant other and just want to get away from the fast life in las vegas for a night and enjoy good food and feel like your in another town when you re only 30 min from the strip
  had high hopes for trying a new place we love hibachi restaurants kids dig the flames mom dad enjoy sushi had a very very bad experience here the sushi was practically inedible the maki was prepared so large that you couldn t fit a piece in your mouth which left you either trying to bite it in half or cut it with a knife which totally defeats the purpose the sushi was placed on waaaayyyyy too much rice leaving you to pluck the fish off of the huge ball of rice our server was friendly but abandoned us for 10 minutes at a time on more than one occasion and even longer at the end of our meal when everyone was way past ready to leave for the kicker when she brought the bill an 18 gratuity was automatically added when i asked about this i was told that it s added for parties of four 4 or more i totally understand factoring in gratuities for large parties but let me tell you adding it to a family of four is pure presumption i have seldom been more dissatisfied with a dining experience
  nice to have pho available late night but the music is so loud you can t even the person across from you food is decent it was nice to make my pho to my preferred level of spicy ness pretty full bar ample amount of seating easy to locate and decent amount of parking still can t get over how loud it was though
  best cookies ever chompies has nothing on paradise s cookies and baked goods so good my siblings have me bringing them cookies from arizona to california the one and only thing i will miss in arizona is going to be paradise bakery
  chompie s is delicious i always use their call ahead so we don t have to wait since they definitely are busy on the weekends this weekend they seated our party of 13 sunday morning as soon as we got there bustling animated and fun chompie s not only offers high quality breakfasts and lunches but a dynamic fast pace for dining you may need to wait a little bit for your food since they get so busy but that s part of the experience just keep busy with the various football games displayed on their tvs throughout the restaurant it s nice too that you can walk through the restaurant and the staff gets to know who you are that sure doesn t happen at big chains personally i enjoy their coffee over ice with hazelnut creamer chompie s egg breakfast with loose scrambled eggs with american cheese on top and their everything bagel with olive pimento cream cheese their potato pancakes are incredible with sour cream and apple sauce yum gretchen is by far their best server with her 100 accuracy for orders and her charming attitude when i m traveling or on vacation i miss home since i miss out on my weekend ritual of chompie s
  there are a few things that will make me give five stars the main reason being they have some of the best pan seared scallops i ve had anywhere this is a family owned business and you can definitely tell they use fresh ingredients always a plus i had heard a lot of hype about this place but i m usually not to keen on the new hip place i hate going to newer restaurants when they re busy and just crowed with people of course that s what they want i ve had a lot of people tell me that they like places just because they re new and cool not because of the food so i was kind of nervous especially because the food here is not on the cheaper side for dinner we had new england fry clams and calamari caramelized sea scallops grass fed filet mignon side of their well known kale and anaheim pepper mac cheese i will tell you i was not disappointed with any of the dishes the clams and calamari were cooked perfectly and they weren t like rubber like you find at a lot of places around town the scallops where amazing the had this vanilla bean cauliflower puree and true sauce that really made the dish absolutely delightful the mignon was cooked perfectly as asked and have a very distinguished taste and on to my favorite the mac cheese never have i had kale in my mac cheese but my goodness it was quite a charming surprise it has a nice spicy cheese sauce from the peppers and it so was nice and creamy perfect combination they have a really nice homey feeling to the restaurant very creative decor and they have good service they were booked so if you go in when it s that busy do expect a bit of a delay definitely make a reservation before going in for dinner they also have a large variety of specialty drinks i ve heard amazing things about their chicken sandwich i m just not big on things like that for dinner soooo that means i ll be going back for lunch soon
  nothing gourmet here greasy fried food barely any crab legs i didn t eat much and i kept throwing good away cause it was nasty save your money and go elsewhere not going there again
  gotta say i love chelsea s kitchen it s sparse and loud but the service is always good and the food is excellent specifically i think they may have the best veggie burger i ve ever had the tuna tacos are almost as good when they re on the menu speaking of things that aren t on the menu they sometimes have a summer melon salad with almonds and avocado holy sh t it s refreshing and delicious but again it s never on the menu and only available seasonally so make sure you ask for it i go with jenn h all the time and her favorite is the short ribs with the fried egg on top far from kosher but extraordinary nonetheless and for what it s worth chelsea s was featuring short ribs far before it became the standard of every hip eatery across the nation overall this restaurant is a strong consistent star plus it s open late and you know i like that
  best cheese steak i ve found in phoenix and the wings are very good as well the area isn t the best and a bit hidden in a strip mall but well worth it highly recommended
  the pumpkin bread and banana bread are freshly baked and served piping hot my girlfriend and i loved this place so much we actually came back the next day for breakfast the omelettes are ridiculously huge you won t leave this place hungry at all definitely go small if you don t have a large appetite the regular sized omelettes are made with 6 eggs whereas the smalls are made with 3 4
  avoid went there on a livingsocial coupon and won t be going back the food was far below average the service was ok but by no means great the waitress seemed new and not very used to the job the place was virtually empty 3 tables total and she seemed overwhelmed the menu is definitely uninspiring if you have a diner you should at least be able to be somewhat original with the food choices definitely never again
  do not come here terrible experiences all the time hot and ready my ass the only thing that seems to be ready here is the soda in the cooler or the ranch dressing seriously everything on the menu that says hot and ready has never been available except the generic 5 dollar pizzas on occasion final nail in the coffin came tonight was told that i would need to wait 10 minutes fine an employee after 20 25 minutes asked me what i was waiting for when i let them know they informed me that they gave it away to another customer fine i was told it would come out in about 10 minutes brought the pie home and after biting into it raw dough fuck put it in the oven when we got home and gave up on the experiment the rest will go in the garbage and be transported to a landfill i would assume the one out in gilbert called up the store to tell them the situation and spoke with a manager informed him of the raw state of the dough he did offer to remake the pizza for me but i wasn t driving back i had already spent 45 minutes waiting for an under cooked pizza imagine how long it would take for a finished one being in the spirit of christmas we rewrote a christmas song for this store as sadly i can no longer endure our relationship together seeing as you no longer care about my feelings i am only out 8 bucks for the experience so life will go on it will not go on with this locations food for me sung to the tune of i ll be home for christmas cue the band i ll be home with pizza if only in my dreams
  i am not sure what the food is like but the hostess was rude and condescending we showed up at 5 10 on a monday evening we were treated to a lecture about not having reservations not once but two times by the same person if you can seat someone then do so graciously i am not there to be lectured that i did not have reservations we did not stay and we will not return the menu looks interesting but i guess you need reservations
  love this place we usually home here for lunch with friends while in the biltmore neighborhood or after a fun day of shopping their kale salad is amazing chicken finely shredded kale cashews toasted coconut omg i know it may sound a little odd but it is so good that i order the same thing every time when i m eating it i don t want it to end please don t ever take it away their roasted chicken entree is also amazing we always order the same things because we crave it nice atmosphere a brighter more modern version of houstons with the same great staff service and consistently great food parking can get busy during peak hours
  was at the sls today in search of a good lunch as it was chilly in las vegas i was craving a huge bowl of hot soup the menu at ku noodle appeared to be the answer we decided to split jumbo soups and make that lunch the congee soup was 5 star while the superior wonton was 3 the congee soup had a lovely thick texture with flawless flavor the chinese sausage and crunch water chestnuts combined truly worked we both loved it and scraped the bowl clean the superior wonton soup had nice wontons and bok choi however something was amiss with the broth and it needed to be served a few degrees hotter we had 4 star service and the prices were fair considering the fact we were at a jose andres establishment i shall most definitely return as there are many items on the menu i wish to try
  loved this place the atmosphere is so romantic and all of the staff does their best to make your time there incredible your meal includes a rose for the lady bottled water a salad made tableside a dessert tray with mini treats and chocolate covered berries and a sorbet steak wasn t the best i ve had but i m really picky the steak was very good but if this steak was served in a barn with crappy service i wouldn t be raving about this place the overall experience is what makes this place dinner for 2 was 150 with tax and tip not bad for vegas and not bad considering all that was included we left stuffed
  i ve been to several pbs in the valley they are always pretty good and very consistent i liked my mandarin orange muffin sunday morning i wish they d get with the trend and offer a green iced tea option at some point
  had the chance to stop here for lunch today the owner is very cool and showed me the goods cooking in the kitchen i felt like guy from the food network everything was fresh and the beef brisket sandwich was delicious highly recommended
  been going here for three years but they must have changed chefs recently grandchildren ordered spagetti but they refused to eat it after i tasted it i knew why the sauce tasted like tomato paste with a little spice no meat as stated on menu i had alfredo not much better no garlic or wine just bland cheese sauce on noodles chinese chicken salad the meat was fine but there was no dressing on the lettuce their menu is limited and expensive for what you get salad is not included in the more expensive meals unfortunately this restaurant is the only one in town that has ambiance they could really make this place great if they took advantage of their location with a menu that competes with chain restaurants in mesa heard their breakfast is good though should be for 10 on weekdays
  excellent food and fab service is what gets the 5 stars inside has a surf atmosphere very open with tv s everywhere menu is slightly confusing but while enjoying an appetizer we figured it out our server was courteous and friendly i had the wings and they didn t disappoint big wings wished the garlic in the parmesan was slightly stronger menu looked to offer lots to choose from will definitely return
  long line but totally worth it they had endless options for food made to order omelettes pancakes french toast bacon sausage and my favorite part was lots of fresh berries huge sweet strawberries most importantly we ordered the champagne beakfast and paid abot 60 for the two of us so it was not cheap but i left full and satisfied not to mention they served gourmet desserts for breakfast the cheese cake and tiramisu were divine
  great healthy alternative for lunch well priced for quality food the first location for this chain in charlotte
  was in town for a football game and wanted to grab some food beforehand i love greek food so hadda try this place it s nestled in a cute shopping area walking distance to univeristy of phoenix stadium we caught them on their opening day and the place was super busy we even met the owner who was very nice and welcoming ordered the gyro pita with the greek fries mmmm very very tasty and good size portions so good that we ate there again after the game 2nd time around we waited crazy long for our food but again it was their first day so i ll cut them some slack must try if you re in the area
  i thought an update was necessary considering i have been here quite a few times the last 6 months i have been slacking on my reviews or perhaps i am just not as motivated on my review updates lol well to be straight up and direct my only reason for visiting this buffet is for the crab legs the crab legs are always the star and winner of the grub session at this buffet also my friend and crab legs eating buddy really enjoys the additional and optional add on for unlimited beer wine and champagne 9 99 she can go through two or three damn bottles of white zinfandel in one sitting i have tried doing the unlimited beer and wine just once but it is just too much to eat and drink like that i can eat a lot but not on a belly full of alcohol hell no the buffet is small really not a whole lot of other options of food items they need to switch up their items it is the same buffet line every time i pretty much know in advance exactly what i will be consuming no surprise as to what will be available at the buffet i mean come on think of us locals that visit on a regular basis it s all about the crab legs i feel like a crab leg whore with every plate i devour variety is the spice of life come on harrah s i know they can do better than this i have faith
  we had a very disappointing experience today at over easy first of all the service was lousy slow and inattentive we had to remind the waiter twice to bring drinks and once to bring toast that came with my father s meal the food was equally unremarkable i had the cheddar biscuits and gravy and they were bland barely seasoned and cold my husband had the famed waffle dogs and he said they were decent but that s about it our friend had the chicken fried steak and found it lacked seasoning and the breading was sliding off of the meat she said the hash browns were the best part of the plate giving them three stars overall we will never come back to over easy again due to the service and bland average food
  improv has turley cranberry sauce and stuffing delicious get without mayo clint eastwood has fajita chicken grilled onions lettuce chipotle sauce pepper jack cheese also good but not as good as the improv which i was very skeptical of free cookie with sandwich order this place exceeded my expectations for a quick sandwich nothing to look at though
  it s a burger joint no wait it s a cocktail bar or maybe a sports bar it s all of these combined i consider m brgr to be one of the leaders in the local downtown burger scene unfortunately i can t get over the prices for the quality of food that you get there my biggest gripe is their burgers and hot dogs have too much bun sure you will have a great time there the service is great the staff are super friendly and go about explaining to you the menu if there is a canadiens game on they will have it showing my recommendation to you if this is your first time stay away from the build a burger menu it can get really expensive try one of their pre made menu burgers or maybe the burger of the day i ve gone twice to m brgr my first bill was 50 tip incl and this was for my wife and i w 2 burgers a little big zak and big zak fry basket and 2 sodas that s 25 a person for burger fries and a soda the big zak is huge be prepared to make a mess and have the bun break apart in your hands a fail in my books for a burger the fry basket is 12 and comes with french fries sweet potato fries and fried onions a la french s fried onions it s okay but a lot of fried items and you ll want to hit the gym after eating it on my second visit i wanted to treat a friend to dinner before the habs game their burger of the week was 60 pulled pork poutine atop their aaa burger cost was 17 i ordered a chili poutine a chili dog and two beers he went for a hot dog and pulled pork poutine with two beers the poutines were good i would have to say that the pulled pork was better than the chili version their pork is smoked in a smoker for a good taste and smothered in a bbq sauce the hot dogs just didn t do anything for us there is simply too much bun being served with this meal the sausage is tasty a little salty but the bun is maybe twice the size of the dog we ate the sausages total bill for that meal was 76 eat at the bar if you can the bar staff are great at not only making you a drink but striking up a conversation a side note that i forgot to mention m brgr does help the community a portion of their sales go towards the montreal children s hospital
  first time at geisha house the interior is beautiful and we were seated right away we ordered drinks i had a lychee martini and it was so good the sushi was good not fantastic but good it was about average with many other sushi restaurants our server not so great we had to keep looking for him and flag him down for drink refills and additional sushi orders the restaurant was not busy at all it was an alright experience i might be back if i happen to be in the area
  the porkbelly buns were a combination of sweet and yummy with a little salty kick to compliment it the price here is kinda expensive our tab was 400 for 16 people
  pretty good food for a buffet i m not too much into buffets but since i was in vegas and you can t leave vegas without a buffet this one was a great one to go too especially if you re tired of the vegas steak prime rib specials the seafood was fresh the food was always served hot and the wait staff was pretty prompt about making sure the tables were clean plates were taken soon after finishing a mean and the drinks were always refilled my sister actually had her wedding reception here and they did a good job accomodating us except when the wanted to seat other guests in the area my sister reserved that i felt was kind of rude a buffet is a buffet so i don t know what else to say bout it but hmmmmm deliciouso
  i was in las vegas vacationing stopped into soul food cafe loved the food best cobbler i have tasted in years hats off to the chefs great customer service friendly family atmosphere recommend the fried chicken very well seasoned top it off with a bowl of cobbler you won t be disappointed
  oh hell ya with a double fist pump in the air that s what i thought when someone handed to me a lunch menu of anna s garden hong kong cuisine it s been a long time coming vegas is in need of a good hong kong style cafe serving some yummy cantonese fare but is it too good to be true ahh yes the food offered at anna s garden is deserving of the highest honor that the cantonese language can bestow on any object that is sold yao peng yao leng translation it is cheap it is good and that my friends is the story of anna s cantonese oasis
  this food warms my soul and i m from the midwest so delicious the ceviche was amazing who knew that serving it with a room temperature potato and yam would be such a delectable combo our entrees were amazing as well ask for the special green sauce it s amazing over the rice save room for the coconut flan we are already planning our next visit to mi peru
  first impressions are first impressionas 25 min wait i ve new waiting on an hour and 45 mins this place is great food wise i hear but seriously on a mon or tues if you re telling folks only 25 mins and they re still waiting 2 hrs its pretty ridiculous get your seating system straight we table of 4 left tired of waiting tons of great restaurants just around the corner
  second time eating here and this time around no wait we were very happy because we did not have to wait we ordered the beef jerky for an appetizer the crispy duck panang and rad na the beef jerky was a lil chewy for my liking but it had great flavor especially the sauce it came with for the main entrees we ordered the crispy duck panang which was pretty amazing def will order that again the rad na was okay i wasn t a fan of the gravy will def go back to try other dishes
  it s our first time here and great food not too salty i think the star of the meal is the chashu roasted pork it s very tender and doesn t have too much fat which is great
  lots of vegetarian options and they are pretty good the 18 dinner includes a soul appetizer and entree i loved the spring roll with mango and the lemongrass peanut tofu entree very friendly staff the portions could have been a bit bigger for my taste
  wait staff nice but food quality really dropped won t be coming back especially since so many new really good crawfish restaurants have opened up
  federal pizza makes a statement once upon a time back in the madcap 80s some people had lots of money to blow on things like cocaine south african gold krugerrands and cabbage patch dolls or deposit their money in savings loan bank like institutions thanks to people like dead local crook charles keating who built the phoenician resort the scandal of savings loans cost everybody lots flash forward all the s ls went belly up one ghost of the era was the derelict federal savings loan on the corner of oregon and central avenues flash more forwarder upward projects who owns and operates area juggernaut postino whose bruschetta is great but not the best that award goes to cibo end of subject the fab windsor with an amazing crab cake sandwich and churn bought the white elephant they ve also purchased the defunct aiello s italian eatery next door poor old veteran nearby dairy queen better be afraid very afraid economists call this a monopoly hence federal pizza was born as a nod to their ancient incarnation the old s l was gutted and fashionably remodeled with reclaimed materials including a ceiling brilliantly utilizing stacks of corrugated cardboard to muffle the thumpa thumpa music the interior is light and airy in the daytime filled with business people and hipsters and intimate in the night filled with hipsters and glitterati the booths filling the center give you a spectacular stage for viewing the clientele and the open kitchen one big boon is the charming tom risner who couldn t be a better tuck trader serving investors the tlc salad 10 is a safe deposit standout with arugula spring greens beets pears smoked almonds fennel pecorino and is a sparkling choice among the five salads you can add chicken for 4 twelve very different interest drawing pizzas star on the menu each imaginatively conceived pie is 12 crafted by master baker that s baker mj coe husband of pastry artist tammie one features roasted brussels sprouts pancetta manchego cheese roasted garlic and lemon zest a variety of tastes make it a surprise but if you don t like the cruciferous sprouts you might stick with the more traditional pepperoni or four kings cheese pizza most of these brick oven babies run around 13 four prime rate sandwiches are available served on the fantastic house made bread however the porchetta with slow roasted pork loin pork belly arugula carmelized onion and lemon 10 was a bad debt fatty fatty fatty may love be your next big wave a side of crispy polenta sticks with romesco sauce 4 earned a high appraisal the former drive thru is re purposed for take away the fancy new speak for take out you won t have to dip into your christmas club account to afford federal pizza but you might want to save a few pennies here and there your account can add up fast if you re a spendthrift and you know where that got the savings loan situation
  this place was really close to my hotel and in this part of pittsburgh it s slim pickins for late night snacks and drinks in fact this was the only place still serving food past 10pm although we had to hurry as they stopped at 11pm my friend and i decided to split the tapas platter for 22 what came out was two tiny pieces of chicken for the satay two miniature hot pocket type crab wontons nickel sized short ribs and a microscopic lump of ahi tuna tartare i could get these items in bulk at trader joe s for half that price i ve dined here in the past and the meals were always good and substantial so a word to the wise if you think this is one of those establishments where you get such large apps that you could order one as a makeshift meal then you will be poor and hungry
  i am typically not a fan of the scottsdale bar scene but kazimierz in an exception they have a very chill environment which is a breath of fresh air in scottsdale it is a speak easy with the entrance located in the back there was multiple comfortable seating areas where my friend and i hung out for hours the night we went there was live music a local band which we enjoyed i love kazimierz
  great hole in the wall restaurant all you can eat dinner is not expensive the quality of the food is still awesome wide selection really great service the owner is really nice too both times i ve been here he made an effort to greet all the guests ask how their experience is going what i find unique about this place is that the owners are latinos so in some of the rolls they have a very hispanic taste when it comes to the spicy salsas they use i love it definitely will be back regularly to get my sushi fix
  i ve heard good things about this place and decided to try it but in my opinion it was overpriced and the food was just okay i had the caipirinha morango cocktail and i was very disappointed the drink was watered down and had one strawberry my friend ordered the same drink and her s was filled with strawberries i asked the waiter if i could have more he said yes but forgot and did not return overall i was not impressed with the food and service for the price and would not return
  great service decent prices awesome patio but not for fight night it s to fighty lol
  first timer from socal having father s day dinner with my dad and my family certainly not the place for anyone concerned about how they look eating in front of others cause they don t backyard family style eating with great food and service our waitress susan provided exceptional service along with the food we had the shrimp with butter garlic sauce by the pound king crab legs with the proper tools to extract the meaty contents gator nuggets yes alligator can i just say excellent and it really does taste like chicken along with clams and oysters no doubt it will be a positive experience when you have a prepared expectation to get messy side note if you wanna unplug your kids for an actual dinner this is one way my teen kids hands were too messy for them to answer their phones text etc we maintained full conversation during dinner overall great seafood dinner experience keep the positives going and when you get susan as your waitress mention she was mentioned on yelp
  maybe i came on a bad day but service was not up to par in comparison to all the other strip restaurants the best part i could say i had was probably the complimentary baguette that was given in the beginning of our dinner our server took a while but we were patient i saw a sandwich from afar and asked her what kind it is and where one could find it on the menu we missed the lunch menu but she said she would make an exception for me and order it turns out it was a steak sandwich and i didn t feel like eating steak and asked for chicken instead grilled chicken breast with brie cheese and tangy granny smith apples sounds great right it should be problem was i had too much bread going on in my sandwich or not enough filler in between my bread my eating companion got the classic steak and frites he has had his fair share of french cuisine and stated he definitely had better but it was decent all in all not sure if i would come back here next time i visit vegas
  max max max max bout damn time you opened up only for me to find out that you still have a lot of kinks to work out based on reviews and word of mouth so i was thinking a couple months should give you enough time to get your s t together fast forward to monday january 6th 7 pm dinner time 8 of us show up and are seated in a timely manner so far service seems legit we ordered garlic fried rice lechon kawali sizziling tofu chicken sisig pakbet sinigang na baboy fried bangus and of course max s fried chicken we ended our feast with buko pandan and halo halo for dessert we got our food rather quickly again service seems very good it was not until we got all our food that the i noticed our server disappeared we were enjoying our food but was wondering when we were going to get refills on all our drinks we also wanted to order dessert i would say we did not see our server for a good 15 minutes we ended up flagging another server to find out where our server was so he finally comes back to attend to our needs as i told him that we needed refills and to order dessert i smell the strong odor of cigarette smoke all over him and his breath as he acknowledged our needs dude now we know where he has been he obviously was on his break smoking pop a breath mint or 20 i hope he at least washed his hands memo to upper management or whoever is in charge of hiring and training your servers either you need to do a better job of keeping an eye on your employees or hire better servers i mean when somebody goes on break someone else is supposed to cover temporarily until that person comes back so we get our refills finally and our desserts at this point i just wanted to finish and pay up so we can get out of there overall i was actually impressed at the beginning until our server went on his break it s such a shame too because the food was 4 star worthy but the service was no better than a 2 so this is where i can justify my rating of 3 at this point in time maybe in another couple months or whenever i feel that enough time has passed for you big wigs to finally pay attention to these reviews that have a common theme and actually do something about it until then i predict your average will not go any higher than a 3 yelp 2014 365 review challenge 8
  very excited about the market by jennifer s as in i tried it this past weekend and oh i m already going back today i was excited to see that the place was packed because i want this market to be around for a long time the location is great in the complex with antique gatherings poor little rich girl and zipps right next to crudo and facing 36th street they ve taken limited exterior space and managed to make a great outdoor patio that doesn t face indian school yay inside ohemgee exposed ceiling french inspired chandeliers and cafe tables the devil is in the details and they nailed it even the water beverage bar is on a french industrial table while the order numbers for your table are made of solid wood with bold font numbers it feels provincial trendy and local at the same time i like a well designed space the service was great diners order at the counter and the food comes to you as soon as we walked in a server told us the process gave us menus and told us to make ourselves comfortable at a table while we decided this avoids a long line at the counter while we sat and looked at the menu we were served water and asked if we had questions although this is an order at the counter cafe we never had to get up to refill our water glasses the servers were on top of this for us and we did have a question which of the menu items do we try because they all sounded ridiculously good traditional lunch and dinner entrees and nosh boards we went for the molten fondue nosh board because we were on a diet i kid i kid fresh fruit locally made sausage bread and pretzel bites on a great wooden board with a small cruet of fondue it was a prefect light lunch for two and it was so good that when we finished the board i was honestly tempted to drink the few remaining drops of the fondue straight maybe they should offer this as a cocktail molten fondue neat we didn t have dessert or pastries but the looked worth the splurge last but not least the grab n go a fridge of prepared entrees that you can buy and pop in the oven at home i was excited to see entrees in a range of palates sophisticated choices for an adult get together to comfort food for the kiddos i hear the mac n cheese is so addictive you should warn your arteries my only point of contention every review has one is that they are closed two days mondays and tuesdays deal breaker nah i m hoping they re testing the waters and might compromise on one day for those of us hoping to pop in to grab an entree or two for dinner so clearly i m a fan i will probably become a norm like regular cen pho arcadia was crying for a place like this casual easy with exceptional food yay yay yay
  good place for lunch though i used to think the portion sizes were great but now me thinks they are a bit much last time i came the bbq was great just too much of a good thing though didn t feel too well after eating my philosophy is to wipe your plate clean i hate to waste food at least you know you get your moneys worth here i did try the spicy bbq sauce available at the counter and it had a good zip to it i think next time i will try the bbq sanwhich instead of the plate maybe it will be juuusssttt right sorry for sounding like goldilocks and the 3 bears
  not a good experience service was slow and not attentive food finally came out which was incomplete i ordered the beet and avocado salad which was one beet sliced the avocado was missing told waitress who brought it back with 4 slices of avocado that were completely brown and soft not edible 12 50 for a small crapy salad this place is over priced and food is sub par
  i like fuel s pizza however they have lost our business we wanted to get one of their meal deals pizza and garlic knots and asked for two slices of pizza with everything on it they said we could not get that as they were not making specialty pizzas today so we could only choose from the five they had out why they can t have customer service and give people the type of pizza on their menu is beyond me they could have easily taken the cheese pizza and added toppings to that we left and forever said goodbye to fuel customer service goes a long way and when you don t have it we will go somewhere else
  this place is located inside the golden nugget where the cafe used to be after remodeling this place is smaller than the cafe they combined cj and a bar in this space service was good food was good large portions like cj are known for i got the black tie chicken pasta it was yummy from the first bite there was a line but it went pretty fast will probably eat there again
  no bs place where you can get good decent vietnamese food i had their excellent spicy tonkinese noodle pho soup a huge bowl with garnish on the side my new death row meal lunch time place was packed with locals and vietnamese what does that tell you
  this place is great flavors are a little different than your traditional chinese but still very good so much so we ve been twice in under a week
  came here for a bday lunch for a friend only 4 or us in attendance we all ordered the lunch special of a white pizza with side cesar salad and an iced tea my companions each received their lunches and then i was advised by our server he forgot to place my order and it would only be 3 5 minutes for my pizza normally the service is good not today when my pizza finally arrived well after the rest of my party was finished eating i asked for a to go box as our lunch hour is over the waiter apologized and told me he was having it compt i was appreciative of the gesture then my bill arrived and the only item compt was the pizza and i was charged separately for my tea and side salad now i did eat the salad and drink the tea but to be charged 7 08 for a side lunch salad and iced tea is ridiculous considering the lunch special for the pizza side salad and drink for my companions was only 9 00 what a joke and i definitely will consider twice before eating at gimaldi s pizzeria again
  busy place on a friday night cool interior although i think their attempt to look authentic comes across as a bit campy still good sushi place sit right at the bar and you ll get instant service we never had a problem getting our orders to us in timely fashion the screaming orgasm was probably the tastiest of the specialty rolls we had the meat was arranged in a poke like fashion over tasty crispy noodles and tangy sauce i agree with a previous critic that they rely on sauce a little too much here but it is tasty nonetheless the jerry roll went down smoothly and the crunch roll can be addicting dynamite was very filling and a good value pick if you don t mind baked rolls for those who don t know it s a mixture of scallop and chopped shrimp baked over rice soaked in a creamy sauce they offer a huge selection of specialty rolls here but they also do nigiri the yellowtail was very thick some of the biggest pieces of nigiri i ve ever seen the squid was as well you don t have to go ayce to get a good value here especially if you re willing to try a number of their nigiri offerings we left quite full and i would gladly return
  came out the snowy cold to the most delicious moule frites mussels and fries the mussels were delicious be sure to ask for some bread to help soak it up mmmm the frites were perfectly cooked but not quite crispy enough maybe cooked a little while ago served with mayonaise of course about 16 i also had a nice but small glass of semillion chardonay for 6 i did not leave hungry i only wich i had room for creme brulee the restaurant is very nice with colorful subdued lighting the bilingual staff was excellent and friendly
  excellent food and service here we love the food and the ambiance ever since the first time we came here and met ruben we always ask for him his engaging smile and personality are an additional treat to a fine dinner and great margaritas best meals carnitas green chile and the ground beef and potato tacos and on those special occasions when it is on the menu the barbacoa is killer
  there were bubbles of soap shining on the tops of my various side dishes so i couldn t even eat my lunch
  awesome i came here while visiting cmu and i was blown away service was exemplary and the food was great i got the california club and it quite good a good casual cafe atmosphere great for studying would definitely become a regular here if i come to cmu
  there are three things that are a must for any vegas trip 1 hot sweaty dance floor action 2 titties at the rhino 3 a big fat juicy piece of meat from stripsteak as far as the steaks go my personal recommendation would be to get the 18 ounce dry aged bone in ribeye 52 its fatty flavorful and absolutely satisfying but if that s not enough for you stripsteak also offers a much larger 30oz porterhouse 69 and for those who want a little slice of heaven you can opt for the 12 oz gold label kobe steak for a whopping 85 might as well right and we all know that no steak dinner is complete without a few sides my faves include teh the scalloped potatoes and the truffled mac and cheese i would say that one side per person is about right but keep in mind that they do send over complimentary duck fat fries to get the juices flowing while you wait for you steak if you re in a rush and want your steak pronto let them know you have to catch a show and they ll throw that sucker on the grill and have it ready for you in no time oh and before you head over to mandalay make sure to hit up restaurant com for a 50 gift certificate below i have also included some eating instructions for you as soon as your steak arrives please take the following steps to ensure maximum satisfaction 1 cut your steak one bite at a time 2 do not stop eating until you have finished you entire steak fat included 3 once you finish your steak begin to eat the steak off of your dining companions plates 4 if they resist stab them in the neck with your knife then proceed to eat their steak as they bleed out
  this is a really cool place with lots of different and delicious food options there are so many potential burgers you can choose from and customize as well as lots of sushi options aside from the burgers the highlight for me was the taste explosion roll it is extremely unique and lives up to its name the downside is that this place is normally very crowded so your wait is long and they will cram you in like sardines to avoid eating dinner with complete strangers i would recommend asking to sit out back on the patio the great food and options here is worth coming back despite the crowd
  ordered the 2 chicken soft tacos so bland and dry i poured salsa all over to help but even then it wasn t so palatable i probably ate half of one of them the mexican rice was gross how do you manage that and the black beans were so salty the outside of the restaurant fools you it looks nice but inside you get really bad food drinks are soooo expensive i ordered a 12 margarita which was good but i can t imagine any margarita being worth that wish i d checked yelp before coming here wish i d gone to pizza hut instead total price of bad food an overpriced drink and decent service for one is 28 makes me sick this restaurant is in business
  last night s attempt at dining at vito s will be our last we had previously visited vito s on a consistent basis initially at least once or twice per week for drinks appetizers and or dinner at the bar while the food is only of mediocre quality the convenience offered by a location so close to home seemed to compensate for this factor as well as the cramped quarters at the bar and the seemingly perpetual presence of at least one or two loud obnoxious patrons who repeatedly made their sojourns to the parking lot only to return reeking of cigarette smoke more recently our visits became a bit less frequent due to the increasing filth present on the bar the last few times we visited we entered to find only one or two patrons at the bar but the entire rest of the bar occupied by other customers dirty dishes that had not been cleared while the staff would quickly clear enough space for us to sit down the dishes would be removed but no effort was ever made to wipe away the food that was caked to the bar glancing around however the reason for the staff s lack of attention to waiting on actual customers typically became readily apparent due to the presence of her royal majesty the owner perched in a prime booth with her entourage demanding the majority of the staff s time and efforts at the expense of the paying customers on numerous occasions we sat with empty glasses for 10 15 minutes while the staff chatted with and tended to the owner and her royal court while the convenience factor allowed us to tolerate these issues the failure of a restaurant to remain open during its posted hours is a fatal error we arrived to dine at vito s last night only to be informed by the bartender that the restaurant had closed a full 45 minutes prior to their posted time customers rely on the hours that a business states that it will be open when making plans and a failure to remain open for business until such a time presents an inconvenience significant enough that we will not burden this establishment with our patronage again vito s may not care about the time customers must waste driving to a different restaurant when they had planned on stopping in for a convenient meal but i can assure them that we will not risk the aggravation of the time wasted on a sunday evening with a long week of work looming on the horizon bye bye vito s we won t miss you
  i was in vegas for business and extended the weekend i had a business dinner here and it was fantastic my colleagues also enjoyed their meals which were short ribs fish and bolognese my caprese salad was amazing my bolognese was perfect small portion perfect sauce the wine sommelier was also helpful as we tried in vein to find a decent wine under 70 we ended up ordering something in the 80 range our waiter was superb friendly knew the entire menu and later i found out is a veteran he was outstanding to our dining experience thank you side note i returned the next night sat at the bar as my colleagues had returned home i arrived late started talking with the bartender who was one of the best bar tenders i have met in a long time showed me the difference in flavor between using citrus in a drink vs slightly singeing citrus peel before you put it in a drink very nice he talked about his upcoming tour to italy that he had won from a bartending contest and was very excited to go i stayed after closing to chat further and met the chef d cuisine who was a charming fellow foodie and whom further educated me on a few new flavors thank you so much great experience i will be back on my next trip
  this was a hit or miss dinner we had a party of eight and some dishes were good others were awful the crispy pigs tails are a must though it would probably be the only thing i would order if i went again which is unlikely
  we enjoyed a nice thursday night at cove trattoria pasta salads and canolis good amount of choices from rich and savory to light and healthy thanks deborah you were great
  great great and more great started with green papaya salad i asked for medium heat and it was plenty spicy tom yum shrimp soup was the best then i had pad thai again ask for little spicy it was perfect i will go back every time i m in vegas
  awesome view over the lake great service and prices come here every time for cross country meets
  we decided to eat here because we were staying at the luxor and didn t want to brave the heat if you have time to burn this is the place service is really slow waited 15 mins for our drinks the appetizers took 40 mins for the wings and another 10 for the mac squares out meals came out an hour and 10 after we ordered it the table behind us called the manager over to complain that they hadn t got there meal and that we order 20 mins after they did i expected the meals to be something more than ordinary but they fell short there too i will not be coming back
  amazing food horrible service the manager didn t seem to care about his poor server we complained about either
  we eat a lot of sushi being from hawaii this place is top notch some of the best sushi we ve ever had love the rolls and hamachi kama we will definitely be back
  i picked up a coconut cream pie for my moms birthday the other day it was bland and really lacked flavor or any good qualities it was definitely not worth the 12 price with tax i don t think we will be back for a pie any time soon
  tried this place last sunday for our father s day cheat meal i had high hopes and was strongly craving some decent mexican seafood upon entering we noticed that there was a guy set up in the back with a laptop and some really loud speakers dj ing ranchero music i am unclear if this was because it was father s day or if this is the normal scene on weekends either way the music was so loud you cannot hear the waitress or each other we ordered a large shrimp cocktail and a shrimp quesadilla to share service time wasn t super quick but we weren t in a huge hurry so this wasn t a major issue the waitress brought us some chips and a good greenish colored salsa i am assuming it was tomatillo based a little while later we received our cocktail and our quesadilla both were ok but the shrimp in each had the mudvain still intact the cocktail was on the watery side but did contain a decent amount of shrimp albeit dirty shrimp and avocado the quesadilla was cheesy and overstuffed i picked out the shrimp with an obvious mudvain and continued to eat the quesadilla because it did have a good flavor the wait for our check was excessive and we eventually had to flag down the waitress to request the bill i am doubtful that i will eat here again but i have heard from friends that the other items on the menu are pretty good
  i was mad at myself that i had not heard of this place until today aparently it s been open since november this beautiful looking middel eastern slightly upscale atmosphere restraunt made my day i had the kafte wrap with a side of potatoes dressed in olive oil lemon juice cilantro and other spices the wrap was delicious the meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked and the tahini sauce dressing the lettuce and tomatoe inside just perfect the only complian i have is that the pita was not warm but the taste of the other ingredients is very satisfying the decour gets a lot of points they have paid a lot of attetion to detail and the tables the cahirs the bar the curtains eveything is very traditional and yet ecelectic and very good quality the location is nice and i can t wait to go back for dinner the owner knows what he s doing and how to make you feel comfortable at your first visit all in all i am glad this place opened up in uptown i can see myself going there for lunch during the work week when i crave for good food i am being told that they will have hooka s sheesha very soon and tables outside by the patio i can t wait for the weather to change and hang out at this place on friday evenings
  the best part is this place open 24 7 the service might be a little slow and cleanliness is just ok but i would drove 10 miles from my home for this place their thai food is really authentic please be careful if you like spicy because their will make it satisfy your needed i will become their regular for sure
  sushi unbelieveable awesome service impeccalbe price holy i love sushi as much as the next person but wow i can t see paying the prices they ask for it was an experience that i m happy to say been there done that unfortunately if i don t hit it big at the tables pre dinner i am not dining there i d have to sell a kidney
  on tuesday thursday or saturday as long as it s not a game day joe s half priced burgers are a power move these things are huge come with a generous portion of fries and it s really the kind of meal you should eat only half of and bring the rest home as leftovers i ve had most of the burgers without mushrooms the bob marley spazzle four twenty dick butkus and california are some of my favorites if you re not feeling fries then their mac n cheese is actually pretty good
  i am definitely a happy camper when it came to my experience last night the service was on par where we had no substantial waits between ordering drinks apps and our main course even though we didn t come for specials our waitress made sure we got every deal that could apply so we got 10 wings and a 10 free for each person at the table we had no issue getting 2 sauces per 10 wings i think i might be a traditionalist because i loved the regular hot sauce my main thought is that the wings which were boneless were way too small to be enough to feed me good thing we got sides buffalo chicken dip and the free fried pickles with checkin offer here is some tidbits the flavored tea is about 4 a glass and the glass is small and mostly filled with ice the flavoring made the tea really foamy and kind of disturbed me however it tasted good but no refills however the menu made it seem like it came with refills the waiter was cool she let us take our time and didn t ever rush us the overall experience was something that leads me to believe i could be a regular my only wish is that the boneless wings were a bit bigger
  if you are in vegas after a long night of partying this is the place to go the portions are huge and completely worth it if you are a total rewards member you get priority seating which is amazing i ordered the omelette while my friends got a chicken benedict i think and it was honestly it was delicious
  while visiting vegas i wanted to give this place a try since i have friends suggesting it to be one of the better pho joint in town unfortunately i can t seem to agree the broth is what makes it or break it it was dingy broth and all i tasted was salt the meat wasn t fresh and the little amount of noodles that they gave was over cooked just didn t do it for me
  a nice change like most of las vegas it s full of corporate coffee houses ie starbucks so it s nice to finally come to a place here that isn t a drive thru or a get them in get them out kinda of business plan with a nice two storey seating area and outside area this business lifts the regular run of the mill standards that have been a custom to in vegas with a nice selection of pastry and sweets to satisfy even the most hardcore sweet tooth this coffee house competes well with the eateries surrounding it last time i was in they had a nice acoustic band playing a little quite music it was a nice change from a cd playing the only cons i can think of is the location is it is surrounded by very popular places so grabbing a park can be quite a effort for a cup of coffee or tea
  reviews are 100 correct food is outstanding and very authentic beware that the place does not look that impressive from the outside but rest assured the food is outstanding
  i didn t think the meal was spectacular but it was fast i love the salsa and chips they put out and the at atmosphere is casual enjoyable i think in the evening it sounds like a fun place but we came for lunch
  the only thing that makes me not a 5 star fan is the price the quality is top notch and it s great but when you have to order 4 pizzas for a gathering it s like 100 again the buffalo chicken pizza is really awesome the carmelized onions make the pie it s about 25 for a large but worth it great the next day too so i look at it like it s multiple beers i also had a beer at the bar while i waited to get it to go also a theme of my reviews lately great beer selection and fun to sit at the bar and watch college football the swimmer eats a whole mighty meaty over two meals and love this for sure
  acceptable service pretty fast juicy meats and yes come here you won t ragrets it fuckingyolo
  some of the peeps at my gf s job recommended this joint so i took my girlie to check it out its a quaint location but don t let the size hinder you cuz the food is delish super friendly staff free refills on sum delicious drinks tried their tacos they were good gf loved them the burger fry s was impressive to me great special sauce on the burgers great on the fry s as arny says i ll be back
  my diagnosis of the yard is that it suffers from bipolar disorder a rare contagious variety that makes me both love and loathe it in return even in writing this review i don t know where to start or what to say from the moment you walk in to the yard there are choices culinary dropout little cleo s inside seating or outside seating your mind reels with the possibilities and you are left wondering who is this place i ve been to culinary dropout a handful of times and each experience much like the mood disorder is different great service one time horrible the next the menu itself can t even decide what it wants to be on it you have your choice of fancy meats and cheeses antipasti or you can order chicken curry you also have a selection of sandwiches and salads but if you re looking for something heartier there s always the meatloaf they ve also included a butternut squash cannelloni for good measure with such an odd variety it becomes difficult to choose something if you re indecisive or have indecisive friends and family this is a great place the food isn t bad but it s not the best either and the portions are pretty skimpy as far as the environment again not sure what the place is supposed to be so it s a little of everything they have a stage at the front of the restaurant far away from most of the seating and i feel bad for the singers and musicians i ve seen there because it s as if they re playing for no one it s an unfortunate layout my recommendation is to come here for happy hour or for a little nosh while you watch the game and be sure to take your lithium before entry
  i was visiting scottsdale for business and my local cousins took me to poncho s for dinner this is their favorite mexican restaurant in the area i tried the sampler with a presidential theme good variety of the mexican dishes available i enjoyed each piece of the plate and the addition of a large marg made it even better i have it on his authority that the pollo fondito is awesome why only 4 and not 5 slow to non existent service at the front and really short handed waitstaff
  after a few long hours of shopping we were famished along the way home my husband pointed out habanero s he said he wanted to try it so off we went the establishment was very clean when we stepped foot inside the cashier was very helpful and answered any questions we had prices are very reasonable and portions are big our total for our meals with three drinks only came out to 30 it s definitely a step up from roberto s item s ordered fish burrito carne asada burrito 2 carne asada tacos chicken taquitos meal the taquitos meal came with a side of rice and beans there were 5 taquitos which was surprising because most establishments only include 3 they were topped off with lettuce cheese and guacamole the carne asada tacos were served on an average sized tortilla instead of the typical small ones and came topped with tomatoes lettuce cilantro and guacamole surprising as well since most places charge extra for guacamole carne asada burrito was huge so was the fish burrito downside they use frozen fish sticks for the fish burrito you could taste them that s the only complaint overall everything was good and had good flavor they have a good variety of self serve salsa s as well employees were very nice we came in with our two small boys and the cashier put on a movie for them to watch meanwhile we dined so thank you habanero s
  oh dotty s i knew ye when ye were a two story staple on state street the new location isn t the same but it is still wonderful big wooden booths and the perfect dark brew pub atmosphere my girlfriends and i hit it up when we are craving a big juicy burger we love the melting pot burger and the swiss and mushroom the fries are also fantastic but you have to buy them seperately my mouth is watering thinking about those fantastic burgers 5 stars
  ok so i know that pizza hut doeant have the best pizza in the world but it should at least be hot right this is now the second time that we have ordered a pizza from this location and nos is the second time that i received a severely cold pizza when it arrived at my door and we only live ten min away at most from the stores location the first time this happened we called and got a credit and figured everything would be ok the next time well we were wrong again today it happened and when we called to tell them the guy who answered the phone blamed it on the football game we ordered an hour before the game because of that reason then he said i could have another credit or i could come pick it up i shouldn t have to pick up a pizza it should be delivered hot and fresh it wasn t hot or fresh it was cold and it was 20 minutes late if you want to test your luck with this store good luck to ya
  the food here is amazing lots of sandwiches to choose from also the staff is very attentive and makes sure the customer is always first stop by today and try one of their delicious sandwiches
  first time i came here and it was great deb our server was the best she knew a lot about the menu and the varieties of draft beers she made a great recommendation for me the food was great big portions at decent prices will definitely come here again real soon
  the service was meh but the kobe burger was pretty solid not sure if the meal was worth the price medium is very very pink but lots of great flavor the skinny fries were not even close to being skinny i was expecting more shoestring and the quantity was not worth the price the milkshakes looked pretty tasty and their beer selection is pretty decent i don t think i would go out of my way to eat at this place again there are plenty of other gourmet burger joints where i would rather spend my hard earned s
  great little place a retro diner feel the burgers are very good and the cheesesteaks are awesome get a cheesesteak with cheesewiz sounds weird but that s how it s done in philly and it s soooooooooooo good the ice cream is wonderful too
  i ve eaten here a few times and i have no complaints the variety of rolls is awesome and they have so many spicy choices i also love the k pop videos they play in the restaurant
  so there is really nothing special about this place its a generic buffet nothing spectacular excpet maybe the chocolate fountain and even then the marshmellows were stale the only thing good with that is the strawberrys the food needed more flavor and the waffles were awful the topping was that suger syrup fruit so no thanks i mean i couldnt expect too much i was just wondering what the line was about and its really not that great the enviorment was hectic and riduculouse people shoving people for a steak it was just sad and annoying overall it was average excpet its true the waiters did ask us if we wanted refills like 30times and they were nice so thats a plus i guess
  it was okay for the price i would not go back the soup and salad were excellent the steak was nothing special the service was good but not great the support staff was better than the actual server although the actual server was very nice and friendly finally and most important it was loud i mean if i say i said what once to the person sitting across the table from me i said it 100 times during the meal if you are looking for a quiet restaurant to share a nice meal go to scottsdale to ruth chris i have to say i am a ruth chris fan and went here to try something new
  fatburger and in n out move over it was the weekend of cityscapes grand opening and one of the busiest places was this burger joint i came here with a friend between concerts and was amazed by how great the burgers were here s the rundown the place nice and clean however it was opened for only a few days when i went they have boxes of peanuts sitting out for you to scoop a bunch and eat while in line or sitting and enjoying your burger i m not a peanut fan but i thought it was pretty cool however they make a mess even with the crew cleaning the shells up constantly the service friendly and fast now when i went about half of phoenix was in the area because of cityscape so it did take a while to get our burgers but that was expected with a line out the door that formed in a matter of minutes i m sure on a normal day the service would be much quicker the price it s pricey yes you get a good burger and a small is the size of a normal burger anywhere else but almost 6 i felt like it was just a tad but too much however you can get almost anything you want on the burger for no additional charge i didn t get fries or a drink because of the price and i already had a pepsi in hand overall i m impressed so far five guys wins my vote as the best burger in phoenix
  i ve had mod pizza a few times and every experience has been great i love the large variety of toppings and sauces the staff seems very happy and is very helpful as well the price is good for what you get they also have a good gluten free option as well for those who cannot eat gluten overall a great restaraunt
  yes i know i am the only person on here to give them 3 stars but please hear me out for my reasoning behind all this on saturday i had made reservations for a party of two at 730pm when he arrived at 720pm it was not really busy nor was it a ghost town in there the hostess stand said it would be a moment as they got our table ready and for us to take a seat at the bar enjoy a cocktail or two and they will get us during our 30 minute wait yes maybe they were short staffed not ready yet etc which i am ok with they sat multiple tables of walk in s and a few reservations of small 2 4 tops i know this because a few sat at the bar whom we spoke to and others i over heard when i stood by the hostess stand to wait to check on my table off to a bad start anyway we had a nice table overlooking the garden down stairs in the back of the restaurant all the back waiters were very prompt and professional with regards to keeping the water glasses full serving the bread clearing the table from the right and serving from the left etc after working in this industry for years i get picky about this crap at high end restaurants the server was pretty on the ball and friendly but a little to relaxed with us yes we are young and eating at a high end restaurant i am ok with that on to the food below is a list of what we ordered and what i thought about it calamari app lightly breaded with light seasoning dipping sauce complimented it very well fillet mignon very tender and medium rare is more of rare but it is better to under cook the steak then burn the hell out of it very tender cut with your fork status sea bass parmesan crusted a little on the very fishy side for my taste which overcame the rest of the flavors cream of spinach very creamy and just was not my style girlfriend liked it though sea salt vinegar fries these shoestring cut fries were epic yes of everything i ate i was most impressed by the large basket of 10 fries warm butter cake once again this was the main reason we went here for my birthday and because the other half loves this dessert more than she loves me multiple layer chocolate birthday cake now to be honest this was what saved mastro s from getting the dreadful 2 star rating from me in my reservation i had noted birthday but no one had seemed to see it hell we even ordered desert and were half way finished with it before they brought out the cake personally did someone at the hostess stand go oops we need to send a birthday cake over to table xx immediately even though they already are half way through their dessert but to be honest they did and it truly made my otherwise mediocre dining experience in to a pleasant one overall mastros maybe i set my expectations to high and i understand you have only been open for a few months now so maybe all the bugs are still getting worked out in the words of my girlfriend it was not as good as the crystal cove ca location yet on par with the one in costa mesa ca sounds like i have to try all this again at the crystal cove location and compare granted thanks for the last minute birthday cake it was nice to see those little comments on open table actually mean something
  we were initially told about 30 min of wait time but luckily we were called with 10 min we got a table outside on the patio great ambience with music playing in the background and the amazing view of bellagio and eiffel tower we ordered nachos platter and chicken enchiladas the food was good but not great the server was so kind and we got free margarita as part of yelp checkin it s vegas what can you expect the patio table was too small and it could barely fit for 4ppl and their food
  this place was really great and we will definitely be back my wife and i went for dinner on a thurs night and we loved the food and the overall experience i had the rotisserie chicken and my wife had butternut squash enchiladas we were both very happy with the main course but the funny thing was that we really loved the house salad and the ceaser salad we got to start off strange but they were delicious the service was very good so no complaints there parking is tough but we found street parking the prices were very fair and i had a beer and the wife had a mojito which was very good we also had coffee after dinner and it was delish
  for grind i am really torn between 3 and 4 stars the inside is cute the burgers are good and big and the toppings are plentiful and unique however i think the 9 burger cost not including fries or drink or even cheese is quite high the thing that is pushing it to 4 stars is the quick takeout service for lunch and the fact that it seems to be independently owned we need more of those in vegas
  last time we ate here i rated it a 5 this time was average i ordered 2 8oz steaks a 6oz steak and a philly cheesesteak the food was average at best and the service wasn t much better the server did a great job but i probably will not go back while we were sitting outside a different waiter had the nerve to pull the heater away to his table without asking us first very rude
  when i heard they were building a jimmy johns near my house i was excited love their subs but the experience i ve had at this particular location bad they always get my order wrong and what irritated me the most is when they forget to put veggies on the sandwich that already come with the sandwich it s happened multiple times like they don t have the pics that tell you what each sandwich has on it for them to follow or they are trying to be to freaky fast that they mess up the order then the manager says they can t do anything about it don t even offer a free sandwich next time you go in or damn even a bag chips never going back they suck and bad customer service the one on 99th ave and mcdowell way better
  what a nice treat we were seated inside quickly and served quickly our server jeanine was pleasant i ordered the steel cut oatmeal and it was cooked perfectly my husband s scrambled eggs and lox was delicious we both enjoyed the coffee served in bright cheery yellow mugs our neighbors had ordered the lobster eggs benedict and the baguette french toast and loved their breakfast as well highly recommend this pleasant spot in the wynn ps had a little giggle after seeing the very professional hostesses in hot pink suits talking on secret service microphones but they were extremely efficient
  don t believe the hype this place is terrible dirty hole in the wall basic breakfast food my husband ordered a couple different plates to try one was worse than the next how do you mess up store bought hash browns and bacon they are completely unflexible with subsitutions and a little pricey for breakfast we live across the street and will not be returning
  love the romantic ambiance here we dropped in after a show for some drinks and snacks and even though all the tables were taken we had a great time at the bar great late night snack menu
  what a yummy find wandering around old scottsdale and didn t know what we wanted to eat hula s looked inviting so we stopped for lunch my shrimp tacos were awesome steve s habanero lime chicken tacos were great and not searing hot the flavors were well blended server reuben was very good and my mai tai was bueno we d come back
  we had a very enjoyable dinner tonight i had the cod fish fry and my wife had the poor man s lobster both were good though the poor man s was a bit blan the garlic potatoes were very good the atmosphere is a compelling reason to come 1855 as it is so comfort and welcoming
  the keg is a great place to go and spend a special evening with someone i ve dined there almost a dozen times and even after trying a few more well known or more expensive steakhouses i continue to go to the keg i first went to the keg when they opened tempe marketplace with my boyfriend on one of our vey first dates it s very modern and dimly lit which i love i always request a booth so i ve never had a problem with seating or being stuck in a loud section of the restaurant my experiences have always been quiet with light background music perfect for conversation because it was our first visit to the restaurant the manager sent over a complimentary shrimp cocktail which was actually really awesome because we both love shrimp cocktail the kegs shrimp cocktail comes with nice big shrimp displayed beautifully in a martini glass and we have ordered it every time since we normally get a bottle of wine the keg has a good standard selection with fair prices taking into account that you are paying for presentation and atmosphere i m a stickler for wine presentation so i love that for the most part all of the servers i ve had at the keg know what they re doing the dinner menu is simple which is nice i hate cluttered menus i always get the petite filet mignon which is wrapped in bacon i ll send a steak back if it s not done the way i asked and i ve never sent anything back while dining at the keg the service has always been excellent all the servers are friendly and know the menu well i ve never had a bad experience actually i normally have really great experiences where i save the servers name so i can request them another time all in all i would definitely recommend the keg to anyone who would like to enjoy a wonderful evening of good wine and great steaks in a modern atmosphere right here in tempe
  although panera is always good tonight was a bit of a challenge went with my sister and our parents around 6 30pm no flatbread no squash soup in trying to combine our orders into pick two batches to save us some money the employee failed to cancel a flatbread when i brought the receipt back up to their attention they immediately gave me the cash back and gave me a free pastry for their mistake food was good
  gave this a try based on other yelp reviews you know how you read about a restaurant with mixed reviews and you just hope that the reviewers with the bad reviews were really picky yeah that s what i was hoping i m here to say that the reviews weren t wrong service is definitely lacking at la catrina and one of the reasons we likely won t return when we arrived around 6 for dinner there were multiple tables on the right side of the restaurant shoved together with a bunch of kids and adults who looked to have recently been to a swim meet there were several booths in the area with kids and adults too the person seating my husband and i bypassed several empty tables on the left side of the restaurant and tried to seat us at a booth in between and right in the middle of all the kids and adults i ve got nothing against kids but why would you sit two adults who are just hoping to have a nice meal in the very center of tables with mostly kids when there are so many other tables available i asked that we move to a different area so instead of putting us somewhere quieter he just moved us to a booth on the other side of the same section noise level was pretty intense until the large groups left we tried to order beers on draft but were informed draft beer was not available for some reason so we ordered two bottled beers it took 10 minutes for us to get our beers i was in full sight of the bar so i watched as our waiter didn t even try going to the bar to get our beers until roughly the 10 minute mark when our beers were finally brought my husband had been given the wrong one the waiter was pouring out of the bottles into the glasses and my husband had to ask him to remove his hand from the label so he could confirm which beer it was he d ordered a darker beer and noticed the beer being poured was more of a light ale lager style our food wasn t memorable but it was okay salsa was really watered down and runny there are so many better mexican restaurants within a 5 minute drive that i just can t imagine why we would ever return here again
  the service was alright the guy that took my order seemed annoyed that i was there and also that i couldn t read their tiny printed menu the food was really good really authentic i grabbed some silverware and it was still dirty service is everything to me i wouldn t come back just because i hate feeling like i m an inconvenience to people working
  you must get a old fashion lazy susan cheese curds and no 30 at some point we were left alone for long periods of time and they did mess up one thing on our order but the manager came out and fixed it just gave us the wrong burger place is loud put the food is excellent
  my friends really like this place i guess i just don t like crawfish or the sound of people eating and spitting them the whole scene totally grossed me out but like i said everyone i was with ate and enjoyed i think they should expand the menu a bit and offer non fried selections to friends of people who like crawfish slurping
  is it bad to go here twice within 12 hours well the last time was like 4 in 24 hours shush i was hungry when i got there after the pool then for dinner then late nigh after the club gosh this time it was after the pool and after the club i got tuna melt both times omg that was so juicy and cheesy i am drooling just thinking about it the second time i waited in a really long line at 4am worth it
  this is one of our favorite go to places for lunch or dinner the food is always great and the portions are always large in my opinion and the menu has a lot of variety for kids and adults not to mention my husband loves the sports theme restaursnt bar with tvs and the bar entertaining the most current games i love the patio for cooler weather and it s nestled in cozy downtown chandler minutes from our house the staff are regular so it s nice to see familiar faces with great service even the owner runs food and waits tables now and then at least we think he s the owner super tall handsome blondish guy
  yum my boyfriend was very sweet to take me here during a dinner break while we were at the golden nugget we don t usually go to downtown lv but it s actually pretty cool anyway this steakhouse is great we ordered crabcake appetizer yumm it s basically all crab meat and no filler totally great the crab pieces are gigantic and plump it comes with a little sauce drizzled on the top with a few chopped tomatoes delicious i wish i could eat some right now this was probably the best thing i ate filet mignon perfectly cooked medium rare they re great cuz they verify what medium rare means to them so that no one gets something they weren t expecting australian lobster tail mmm so many times i have overcooked lobster and it just tastes so gross but this was so good dipped in butter yumm i forgot prepared but it doesn t matter au gratin potatoes just cheesy potatoes i couldn t stop eating it so good the potatoes are chopped into little pieces rather than sliced and the cheese is perfectly burnt just a little on top we also ordered the most amazing red wine per recommendation of the waiter wow it was so good it was the first time that i actually saved the cork unfortunately i can t remember what it was perhaps i drank too much we didn t have time for dessert but i m sure it would have been good or if you re here you can skip dessert and then go across the street and get some deep fried oreos to end your night if you are in downtown lv definitely stop by vic anthony s
  well after about 8 visits i am moving on to the next bar why is it so hard to find a bar where you can get great service great food and fast drinks i own a restauarant in north scottsdale and work alot so at the most 2 or 3 time a week a beer or three is needed after work i always go alone and have met some great friends at twin peaks the beer is cold that being said the girls that work there have the business all wrong i had the same problem at kilt i don t care if you wear a sweater i just want good service i usually have to clean the bar where i sit ask for a menu if i dare eat and am always getting treated like a loser they give you nasty looks have no personality and seem like its the worst place to work ever manager comes out every hour to play on the computer and talk to noone why not ask the customer how their experience is from what i can see here you will still get the dirtbags that like to throw coasters at the girls and get the dirty looks but us industry people know better we want good service and we will continue to hop until we find it one things for sure over my last 8 visits it isn t here it isn t a bad night and i won t be wasting the little time i get to be treated like this ever again best of luck to you i hope you can find better service staff because if you don t your destined to be stocking up on budweiser
  being that i m from the dirty south people point me in the direction of this little hole in the wall with pride as if its some place id like to enter i went once and then once more just to get a second feel of the place this place is so unsafe that i allow the husband to go in the day time only because he likes the catfish but no he wont go alone at night to get robbed by a common cat burglar they have some ok catfish no its not slap your mama good once inside the floors are very nasty people are selling foodstamps and knock off purses as well as cd s and these people get mad if you pass them by and don t choose to buy what they trying to sell like people with missing teeth who yell at you and beg omg its just sad and unsafe the employees are loud and unprofessional they talk about everything from sex to fighting in the store i started to text people just so they would know where i was and so they would know i was not in a safe place the inside of the store itself i could not belly so i took my little self and got back in my car and locked the door i kept texting my husband to see if he was ok once back in the car with me he was like who is your friend i looked at him like really some bum is taping on my window begging for change and u title him as my friend rolls my eyes so knowing i was safe with my husband in the car i rolled down my window and gave the man ten bucks i hated to see him hungry he said he was hungry but he smelled like he had been to fat tuesdays last monday and i know he was drunk so my husband has a bright idea to dig into his fish i yelled as he ate are you crazy start this car lets go i m not trying to get shot because you want to eat our next stop was the beauty shop once inside i told my girls about what just happen they was laughing at me telling me if you go mwm leave your coach bag at home put your money in your pocket and don t make eye contact with the men at all just hop out the car and run inside and get your food and leave i was explaining i don t want to eat from a place where its like a action packed scene from a movie when i go just to get food as i sat and ate my mwm i knew i would never be one of those ladies who was willing to make a mad dash for mwm if i ever have the stuff it will be because of my brave husband and his willingness to provide the fish or whatever else they got that i may want i give it two stars i was told the floor was dirty because it was raining
  don t you forget about me don t don t don t don t don t you forget about me simple mind don t you forget about me the breakfast club was a cult classic in the 80 s the breakfast club in scottsdale does not disappoint though not so much a classic yet they do serve a mean breakfast yum i ordered the eggs benedict while my partner ordered 2 eggs breakfast eggs benedict arnold haha peter griffin from family guy needless to say i loved a good old fashion breakfast and they did not skimp on the portions enough for 5 mischievous students hmmm like going back in time back to the 80 s where breakfast was a time to stuff your face my eggs were over easy for sure while the soft and warm hollandaise sauce gently glazed over the eggs and ham not too overpowering and just the right sweetness i had my hash extra crispy and my bacon i like them soft and chewy i added some hot sauce and i had myself a grand meal will you recognize me after eating here and gaining some weight call my name and walk on by a walk more like a run i ll need rain keeps falling rain keeps falling more like falling asleep down down down down i go simple mind don t you forget about me the place itself had a business diner yet modern feel not your typical dive diner for sure service was spot on and keep that coffee flowing enjoy
  food is usually pretty good my team eats here a lot today we ordered lunch for 5 to go and both of my 3 pc shrimp kebabs came as 2 1 4pc shrimp kebabs it was pretty tacky sending 2 nice shrimp plus a tiny pc of the 3rd i ll post the picture i posted to facebook if i can figure out how
  i may be in bizaro world but this denny s was great compared to all the cleveland denny s the decor was actually new and clean not overly packed for a saturday after hours food was out quick and it all was cooked to order i had the peaches and french toast breakfast i left satisfied and ready to sleep to catch my flight the next morning oh i forgot it is morning hope i don t miss my flight phoenix az is a place i could possibly move to also the waitress offered us a free dessert because the friend i was with did not write in his gratuity correctly after he thought it was her mistake he then realized it was his mistake wow now that s customer service
  i have heard all about this place and all of the cali locations seem to be a bit out of control with crowds so i decided to visit this location on my holiday vegas trip after doing some shopping at the premium outlets i decided to head over and check this place out since it was only about 10 min away i walked in around 5 30ish on a friday and it was pretty empty there were only about 2 3 other tables occupied score for me i had my pick of tables and booths to choose from i settled into my booth and tackled the menu i thought it was nice that they had several tvs hanging around the restaurant which worked out great for folks like me who decided to dine alone so i got right to it i ordered the 2 lbs of the king crab legs with the whole shabang medium sauce and the cajun fries i was going to order the catfish as well but thought that it would be way too much food for me i was right the crab legs and fries were a perfect dinner for me the whole shabang sauce that everyone raves about lived up to the hype it was garlicky spicy and delicious i even dipped my fries in it the fries were crispy and delicious and the cajun seasoning had just the right amount of spice to them service was pretty standard not bad but not spectacular all in all i was impressed with my first boiling crab experience i will def be sure to check out one of the locations in cali
  always yummy the steak is outstanding and the salmon isn t bad either i love this steakhouse far more than other more expensive places there can be a bit of a wait during dinner time but i don t mind because the food is always awesome the appetizers are also good especially the onion blossom
  my second time eating here while i love the flavors and fusions of food that i d never expect to go together tonight the service was too lax it was downright cold in the restaurant i am rarely cold so others much have been freezing which exaggerated the lax service i was in a hurry to eat and leave because of the discomfort it was a 70 meal for one and while delicious the service and temperature both brought the experience down til tonight this was my favorite vegas restaurant overall delicious food in an upscale modern atmosphere the short ribs are delicious and foie gras a nice mix of sweet and gamey
  seeing all these amazing reviews has me really second guessing why i turn to yelp i m not exactly sure if this is constant issue but there were flys all over just landing on around you your food which from the beginning made me question what i was doing there this taco cart really is not that great i ordered a carne asada al pastor taco the flour tortillas were obviously freshly made but lacking that special something of a homemade tortilla i ve gotten better tasting carne asada at filibertos so i m so confused why everyone is praising it my al pastor was better than my carne asada but weirdly chorizo y tasting and crispy the prices were decent the size of the tacos were also decent so better than a one star rating for me
  surprisingly good korean food for a small neighborhood place they are just seconds from my house so i go in every few weeks for some take out everything i have ever eaten here has been great the galbi is excellent all of the sides are fresh and tasty and they vary from time to time so you can try different things if you go more than once they even sell them in large jars if you want to stock up for the winter the kimchi jigae is also great hot and spicy just the way i like it even better when you have a terrible cold the best korean food i am aware of in henderson yummy think i m headed over there right now bye
  quick delivery and cannot stress enough to register for email deals because i never pay full price savings up to 50 off regular price
  clean fast and easy going service qualifies this place as good fast food in montreal salads are fairly portioned and the fish chips was more than enough for me to eat on its own i d be happy to go back here if i was in the area on my next trip into montreal
  this place has switched owners about a billion times ok maybe only four times since we moved to this neighborhood three years ago i guess it s hard to make this place work as a burger joint the veggie burger is ok but even though this place is within walking distance we d rather go somewhere else 99 of the time last time we went i had a craving for onion rings but the ones i got were burnt which made me sad i love onion rings the fries weren t that good either the menu seems to be having an identity crisis there s a lot to choose from but the food isn t outstanding or notable in any way to me but i have not had their non veggie food so maybe for meat eaters it s amazing i don t know the owner and his wife are really nice and i mean both the current owner and wife and the previous owner and wife of jimmy g s and you always get great service here which is why this place gets 3 stars they will even deliver out to your car if you call in your order
  my husband and i stopped in for lunch and we are so pleasantly surprised we live in mn and have a kona grill in our town eden prairie and we seldom go there bc the food is not all that great our server jen w was so great i am pregnant but really wanted sushi so i was looking for some compromises on the raw jen went thru the sushi menu with us and helped us customize the perfect rolls to suit our needs and wants we also split the kona chopped salad it was delish overall a lovely easy well taken care of lunch we will definitely be back thank you to the wonderful and talented sushi chefs and jen w for making it a great visit
  you might see the three stars and believe this restaurant is mediocre or average and i guess you wouldn t be too far off i have been coming to this location for years now and today i finally felt it appropriate to judge my experience s almost every time i come into this location i have to wait a ridiculous amount of time to either be seated or greeted by a server i am 23 and look young and i am often accompanied by a young child as a server i know the combination can be a deadly one tip wise but that s no excuse to provide me little to no service today 04 24 15 i walked in at about 4 00pm the bar was semi busy and the patio had plenty of room the inside of the place was deserted plenty of tables were available and i was ready to be sat and fed there was a gentlemen at the host desk on the phone he didn t look up at me he didn t acknowledge me i was patient and waited until he hung up but even after the call was ended he walked away without saying a word to me at this point i grew annoyed i looked over to my right and i saw two managers sitting in a booth both had seen me come in and both had seen this guy walk away without saying a word you d think that one of them would jump up and save the day but no they continued on with their meeting i finally approached a young lady and asked her if i was supposed to seat myself perhaps that was the case all along and i was the clueless one she assured me that i was right to wait to be seated and that she d be happy to help she eventually came by to serve myself and my little pal she was friendly competent respectful and quick she had no idea that i was a very generous tipper but today i believe i will have made her day she was not only serving us because no one else seemed interested but she was managing take out and all over the place after a while i realized that we were not even in her section she took care of us voluntarily and i respect the heck out of her for doing that the food as always is just fine it s bar food there is nothing exceptionally grand about it but it tastes good and that s what i count on had management stepped up and looked the least bit interested in their servers and clientele and had that young man said hi like he s paid to do i would have given uncle bear s 4 stars there is nothing 5 star about this place as a whole but our server deserves a shout out for sure isabel was her name i believe a skinny blonde girl i appreciate your help and your care
  we had a great meal here the service was attentive we had lobster and tuna appetizers both of which were fantastic the entrees were tasty and the dessert was yummy very conveniently located for the michael jackson one show some minor misses i found the decor strange our window side table was isolated from the dining room by the high backed eggshell shaped chairs of the booth next to us also our seating was arranged with our backs to the window which i found a bit odd
  i was seated at the counter immediately coffee arrived quickly and my order was taken as soon as i put the menu down omelet was large and tasty home fries were plentiful sever kept my coffee cup full did notice a person at the counter for five minutes that never received attention he got up and left as i would have
  for this place to be new they sure killed their first impression with me i ordered my favorite pie like i always do when i see a popeye s but this particular one was very disgusting the pie taste so old that i just threw it on the ground never again
  food 3 stars service 4 stars atmosphere 4 stars tao is the place to go when your in vegas and it s always packed with trendy fun people i really enjoy the atmosphere but i ve never been really impressed with the food if you have a few friends in town that want to experience the vegas seen for dinner and go clubbing all night than this is a great place to start if you re a real foodie who enjoys amazing food and the experience is only a small part of the dinner save your money and head to nobu
  our family has been here a handful if times some food has been great other food not so much for example the flavor and spice level if the chili seems to depend on the days chef we go back every now and then and just choose carefully but breakfast is always good
  theres 2 things i don t like about this restaurant 1 waited 57 minutes just to get to my table 2 the shirts that say legalize marinara but there are many things that out number those 2 things the servers are nice and friendly but when they are busy it seems like they rush the garlic bread is amazing maybe the best garlic bread i ever ate the lasagna was pretty good but you have to wait 1 2 an hour to get it the all you can eat pasta bowl was good like always and if you can t eat a second bowl you can just bring it home free of charge the meatball sub was huge my dad could only eat 1 2 the sub but what kind of trip is it if you don t get the pizza cookie the pizza cookie is the best dessert ever words can t describe how good this restaurant is
  gluten free allergy sensitive this is one of my faves great menu with lots of gf choices and dessert too they do not balk at any allergy requests and seem happy to do so i always get the mussels appetizer the soup no pasta and the chicken marsala it is so big i always have lunch for the next day
  love the decor love the food love the owners yes it is on the pricey side but a you are in scottsdale and b you get what you pay for the food is high quality the freshest mozzarella is used in their salads pizza etc and the desserts are outstanding the tirimisu and macaroons specifically love it i ll be back often
  their smoothie machine just wasn t having it today so they immediately gave me my money back a coupon for a free mccafe drink and a free large strawberry shake they were so nice and accommodating they re lucky it was me this happened to
  really good family owned restaurant home made tortillas waiters really knock themselves out to make sure your dining experience is everything it can be i ordered a burrito it was huge i have no small appetite and was only able to eat about 1 4 of it we ordered guacamole really yummy they make it up for you at the table we had some who like spicy some mild he made two bowls one of each my husband had chiles rellenos his yardstick by which he rates any and all mexican restaurants and gives them a full five stars knocking off a couple of stars for the following ac was off for most of our visit i don t care how good the food is if you re uncomfortable the overall experience suffers we had to relocate to another booth because we were sardined in the next table over had ample room for the 4 of us the soup they serve to everyone at the beginning of the meal reminds me of lipton noodle soup bleh
  i don t know why this doesn t get better reviews still a great breakfast especially considering the price my gf got one of their omelet creations and i got a belgium waffle with strawberries everything was very fresh and portions more than plentiful i think that the decor is a nice touch as well definitely my fave breakfast joint in vegas
  i have to say it is the best taco in town we stopped by this taco shop at 2am after clubbing it is a good hang over food the only problem is long waiting line
  this is the best burrito in charlotte in my opinion i have been to phat burrito too and was unimpressed they have more meat selections than your typical moe s chipotle qdoba etc they load the burrito up with toppings and they don t charge extra for guac yes the hot sauces they have are hot and i love it it sucks this place is uptown or else i would be a regular
  alas another fatality in this strip mall graveyard showed up there last night to find a small hand written sign on the locked door to the effect sorry for the inconvenience there was an indication that they expect to re open but then most restaurants do and since this was already the second incarnation at this location it s hard to imagine someone taking a third roll of the dice pity this area could definitely use an indian restaurant now if only people would actually eat there
  the epicurean experience is fabulous and should not be missed delicious different and entertaining the chefs are inviting and it s fun to watch this well orchestrated kitchen working get there at 5 30 and enjoy
  this place is beautiful no wonder there is always a line every time i walk by service good nothing spectacular ambiance the decor is beautiful but that s sort of vegas food tasteful but not amazing go with scallop price crowd impressive feel with good blend love the vegas crowd everyone is just out to enjoy life personal favorite ambiance and crowd worst expected a bit more from a celebrity chef my meal for two 140 final say drinks at the bar with appetizer should suffice
  better than average but not great i wouldn t choose to come here but i certainly don t mind it i came here for brunch and found the quality was pretty decent there wasn t anything really outstanding or unusual like what you d see at the buffet at bellagio but then again this one is half the price there s a good selection of foods all prepared decently well and enough turnover in the restaurant to ensure that you re not getting left with 2 hour old food like you see at some of the less frequented buffets
  ordered the special slice which i d have to say was a lot bigger than i have expected i love thin pizzas and theirs was just that they were generous on my slice with toppings i had mine to go so it was as fresh out the oven but i def would come back again and recommend to others it s not inexpensive but wasn t over priced this is a case of you get what you pay for and i enjoyed their friendly service and the pizza as well
  duh after a night in vegas you only need pho because thats the best hungover food for you and they have a sign inside to say so if you check in they give you free egg rolls which were really good because they use real meat instead of cabbage the waiter was really sweet i had some pho that was peanut butter y or thick i really don t know what i ordered i should have not gone outside the traditional pho so my bad but the portions were huge with tons of meat
  expensive and poor customer service food was terrible
  came tot his place because of the name tinoco which isn t a popular last name yet it belongs to my boyfriend and his family went here for his parents anniversary dinner when we happened to be in vegas at the same time for a conference parking is in the lot down fremont street it is charged by the hour and i think it cost us 5 total which includes walking down the fremont strip eating and walking back and looking at everything service was friendly small place to eat hidden away inside a hotel food slightly overpriced but oh well i love my lobster raviloli which came with grilled shrimp on the side the corn chowder and shrimp pasta in garlic sauce was good too the owner s wife i m assuming came over to ask us how we were doing and we ended up talking to her when she found out we were celebrating an anniversary she gave us free slices of cheesecake which was only okay due to the caramel swirl overall good service good food i don t know how the bill came out since i didn t pay but i m assuming it was about 20 per person
  don t order a salad to go from here i ve had the kale and quinoa salad in the restaurant before and it was delicious i ordered it to go and was not impressed there was a very very thin layer of kale and quinoa with massive amounts of feta which is not on the menu description and dressing i ordered it with shrimp so it came to 15 for a disgusting salad that i couldn t even eat they turned a very healthy option into a fat covered mess
  great atmosphere and great food the burgers are fantastic big fan of the barbecue bacon bleu burger don t forget to hit them up on your birthday for ten bucks off your meal
  i don t write many reviews but this place deserves zero stars the 13 cheeseburger was small and grossly overlooked i took 2 bites and sent it back best part is they took 30 off my bill and expected me to pay it don t think so go somewhere else there s a mcdonalds outside the palazzo get a burger there
  restaurant ambiance was great we went for my husband s birthday with reservations we were unable to get a table in the outdoor patio but they gave us a table close to the windows the food was only ok overall i would return
  you gotta sit down stairs order from the bar and enjoy get a sconnie beer and some brats red or white both good
  highlights great sandwiches at a great price sandwiches are more fun sized turnaround speed is alright limited seating when you find yourself in vegas there are lots of options and plenty of tourist traps waiting to inhale your wallet fortunately the earl of sandwich stands ready to relieve you of your overspending woes now the value isn t super incredible you re still paying chipotle pricing for a smaller sandwich but think of it like the snickers fun sized version of a subway sub it s more compact but still full of meat and sauce and cheese i got to try the montegu and the 1762 original both were good but i think i preferred the horseradish flavor of the 1762 big horseradish fan i am the ciabatta like bread was nicely crunchy but soft i think similar to schlotzky s and full of flavor the ratio of bread to meat to cheese sauce was good on both where no one element of the sandwich was overpowering overall very satisfying
  we had the a la acarte and sat on the other side the other side was for all you can eat with the cook your own meat grill the service was good and fast which is what you expect at most asian restaurants the bulgogi was really good i have been looking for a place that had the same taste and flavor as the one back home and this one is quite similar the only thing was the cleanliness of the restaurant it wasn t in tip top shape and i don t like eating while i have to shoo a fly away next time i may just have the order to go ohh and another thing it was a little pricey than i had expected typically you can judge at how much a restaurant will be based on looking at the restaurant i think the bulgogi was 14 a little steep
  came for pie and coffee with my lady the pie was excellent the coffee was hot and the server isaiah was superb
  finally tried them i had family in town and they had no interest in visiting the strip so we planned to do tons of local things this was one of them since out first attempt at the sliders was a complete failure and coupled with the fact that i was super anxious to try the sliders i planned to be at the location listed spring valley park on 5 8 2010 at least 30 mins ahead ok not to sound like a total geek we took our pup to the dog park while we waited so it was like a 2fer pup gets to play while we wait for the munchies i felt like i was 5 years old again when i saw the slider truck pulling up i was so excited ridiculously so we get into line and the slider guy started setting up he was really nice and even asked us how we heard about him i said yelp he was so excited when i said that because well i guess yelp is where he gets a lot of his business go yelp i also think that the truck fits the personality of the slider truck guy when you meet him you ll know what i mean so you place your order wait for your number to be called and find a place to sit luckily we were at a park so there were plenty of park benches to park our rears we ordered a total of 12 sliders for 3 people which btw is too much for 3 people i only ate 2 my son had 3 and my husband had 4 so we went home with 3 left over pep peps capreses and i don t remember what the others were because well i got too full before i could eat them lol and my brother ordered a bag of fries for all of us to share as small as the sliders are they are sooo filling they re all full of flavor and everything is made with such quality the fries are seasoned and weren t as bad as some of the reviews that i ve seen so i have a couple suggestions 1 the sliders all have such tasty sauces and kinda get all over your hands all he has are wet naps so bring a few napkins it ll assist with the clean up 2 if you have no intention of sitting in your car or parking your booty on the curb to eat your food i suggest that you bring some chairs he provides the food and service not really a place to sit lol reheat value my husband thought that they taste better the next day personally i don t i have no palette and he does um let me know who s right
  good food good service lemongrass soup perfect for the winter had the king chicken which was tasty good atmosphere overall
  over priced and the food is blah the only thing that i found good on the menu was the choco taco and those can be picked up for a couple of bucks at any convenience store
  this place has faster and better service than pho kinh do and nem nuong they provide a good portion of meat in their beef noodle soup compared to other restaurants the place is quite packed but they have enough staff that you can get faster service than other pho places recommend rib eye pho yummm
  phoenix city grille is a ok in my book great food and service we were here last friday it was my father in laws 60th bday celebration there were about 20 25 of us and yes we had reservations they actually have a private room for large parties super sweet we only had one waitress but it seemed that we were her only table while we were there she was pretty on top of things my wine glass never hit empty she took our orders and i was surprised at how fast the food came out very impressive i ordered the tilapia it had an almond i think crust with a raspberry sauce served over roasted veggies the tilapia was amazing and so were the veggies though the veggie portion was very small one more small scoop wont break the bank pcg its a cozy and dark romantic type setting
  just say no no no to ho ho ho i made the mistake of using their restroom after i had just placed my order for garlic shrimp it was dirty the sink had black dirt residue it was so filthy and the bathroom is also used as a storage facility although they had toilet seat covers in boxes they were not stocked for use i was on lunch at work and decided on the garlic shrimp w lo mein soft noodles there was very little shrimp it was mostly water chestnuts bamboo shoots and mushrooms i really think it should be named garlic mushroom because that was all it was the lo mein noodles were even horrible as they were way too salty thick and dry with zero flavor that was my first and last visit i have had some bad chinese food in the past however this really is the worst i have ever had no doubt it is an insult to associate the word gourmet in any way shape or form with this disaster of a chinese restaurant never again my mistake for not reading yelp reviews prior to visit as i have never been here before i was on lunch from work and drove by and stopped if i had read yelp first then i would have never stopped to dine here
  hot n juicy messy n delicious i love this place a bit ghetto shocking when you walk by the tables with their carnage of crawfish carcasses and other assorted shellfish we had so much fun here ordering crawfish snowcrab by the pound you pick your sauce and your spice level you can even opt for a no spice our waitress was a sweetheart and even demonstrated to us how to peel a crawfish it was my first time having them and they are a lot of work by far my favourite combination was hot n juicy mild spice snow crab the meat is so sweet tender and meaty you can remove an entire section and use it like a paintbrush with the juice so good will be back each time i m in town
  this is a wonderful mexican restaurant i love coming here and have never been disappointed by a single meal best margaritas i have ever had service is amazing
  stayed at the hotel and found this restaurant it doesn t look bad and decided to give a try the waiter was nice and friendly they are very attendant to provide me refills the prime ribs was big and juicy this place did not disappoint me
  man what a night i had about 8 friends in town and my son and i asked them to meet us at maria bonita s we were seated right a way and within a few minutes our order was taken there was only four tables seated when we arrived my son and i ordered first and within a few minutes all orders were taken i also ordered a drink from the bar after about 20 minutes meals started coming to the table still no drink from bar half way through the meal my son s and my dish still had not arrived still no drink i tried to get the waiter but he was not out by tables i finally flagged him down and he said it was coming that they were very busy again only four tables filled now finally everyone had finished meal and some of the party had to leave because they had small kids still no meal i flagged the waiter again and walked to kitchen window no one spoke english in kitchen so they did not know what i was saying the waiter finally came up and said since we order last really our dish was still being made long story short never got me dish never got an i am sorry the waiter was very rude it was his fault i think he never turned in ticket for us he would not tell me his name and kept saying he was the manager we will never go back it was also very embarrassing for my son and i to have invite our quest and to be treated that way awful place left my name and number for the owners or real manager never heard from anyone surprise surprise
  3 5 stars i like the decor was impressed when the server asked how i want my burger done med rare yet dissapointed when my burger came out well done but kinda expected it too anyway so i really didnt mind and happily munched away on it their pizza oven wasnt working i didnt mind bc i had been craving a burger anyway but then the side i chose was potato salad and they didnt have that either no biggie tho the bar was full of what must be thier regular mid day happy hour customers an older working class crowd that must work in the buildings around caps we had hoped to sit up at the bar but they had it all on lock down so we scored a high rise table instead service was good they checked on us often and we had a pitcher or beer at a reasonable price id go back again id like to try thier pizza when the oven is working of course
  can t go wrong with fried tofu roast duck and xo noodle everything is so favorable reminds me of china town honolulu
  i have loved eating at monami since my first visit the staff is always nice and helpful and the food is delicious the first time i came i had the filet mignon which was the best fillet i had tasted to date always have to munch on the bread butter carrot spread or pate try to put your name in for the patio seating at night so you can watch the bellagio water show while eating we always make it a point to have one meal at monami while in vegas breakfast dishes are also very good and the coffee is perfect
  this place is close to the house and i have been in a few times i have had the bbq chicken wrap the steak caesar wrap and the breakfast protein bowl a few times all are very good and the portions are just right i like going here to have a wholesome meal in a short amount of time
  divine pies usually surly or indifferent service even for take out i ve tried a myriad of slices here including the tennessee lemon jack daniel s pecan pie lemon meringue triple berry crumb and cherry all have been delicious from crust to filling the meringue and cream pies when ordered whole look beautiful with high topped meringue peaks and perfectly sculpted rings of cream covering the filling they even have a special sugar free apple crumb pie that has a bit of a hint of splenda fake sugar taste but otherwise very good we ve eaten at the restaurant and their regular menu is just ok nothing to write home about your standard typical american type fare of sandwiches burgers some home style dinners and a few fried selections like i said before unless you get one of the owners you probably are going to be met with an indifferent stare once you enter the store restaurant at least that s been the case when i ve been there it s worth it for the delicious pies though
  this place is absolutely amazing the ambience is trendy and and relaxing the food was delicious i had the carnitas the meat was so tender and served on the bone the margaritas here are out of this world they claim their margaritas are the best in the world and i haven t had one better i ll definitely return next time i m in vegas
  a small menu but a nice mix of choices although the food truck that inspired this restaurant is famous for its dumplings they were my least favorite of the items here although still good i loved the fabulous calamari dry cooked and so good they don t need sauce and the fried tofu crispy outside with garlic scallions and soy sauce small plates there are also four entree choices for meats served with rice and three delicious sounding salads the only menu category i didn t try
  at first i thought i was going to a restaurant that offers doughnuts and vietnamese foods then i saw that they were two different restaurants you basically have to order pay take a table number small styrofoam cup and sit yourself down place is pretty small but it was able to accommodate people who just want a quick soup or sandwich i paid 8 20 tax included for a beef pho soup there was only two choices of soups there and i was hesitant in ordering any egg rolls as i was not sure how big they would be so my 4 year old son and i waited when they server gave my order i was surprised with the size of the bowl the picture makes it look bigger than it was soup had no tendon or tripe the pho would be good for someone who never had it before i ve had better pho but surprisingly this small bowl filled me up by the way you don t get much bean sprouts like the picture in front of the restaurant size is more or a small version of saigon pho my son liked it at the end of our meal i was surprised by one of the employees or owners talking to customers it seems like the restaurant has regular customers without the great customer service i wouldn t come back here but next time i will order the sandwich that the guy next to us ordered they have a clean bathroom too so that was a plus
  the best in the city i come from the uk and we think we know curry i will just say i am in vegas at least once a year and mt everest is one of my first stops
  best sandwich in town veggie avocado add turkey and roast beef bread is fresh out the oven
  love this restaurant it s one of my regular spots now all the servers i ve had so far have all been great they have some kind of fish dinner that is to die for big portions for the price you pay i usually can t finish all of my fish but i can t avoid stuffing myself from trying i also usually get the bunny toes drink it s like a mint chocolate white russian has bailey s mint chocolate in it it s delicious
  i ve never had a bad meal here at north the service is always top rate you must not leave without getting a side of creamy polenta no seriously get the polenta zucca chips sweet savory spaghetti meatballs chef s board so simple but so well executed i love north
  the interesting things about frank lupe s are the name and the decor but other than that nothing else really stood out oh except for the chips great chips but a restaurant can not only be about chips the food was mediocre i didn t even finish my enchiladas which is rare for me didn t find it was worth the calories might be a cool place for just drinks and app s but certainly not dinner
  holy canolli this place is fantastic how have i never been here before the set up of the restaurant is very open and they piped in old school tunes frank sinatra harry james and tommy dorsey it really reminded me of artie bucco s sister restaurant the service was excellent and the staff was friendly and hospitable we even heard the owner chef yelling at the staff from the kitchen wize this fettuccine sitting owt heaar it was classic he really showed a passion for both the guests and the food i had read a few yelp reviews before i chose this place and i can only mirror what everyone else said the italian bread and focaccia with red pepper olive oil and garlic butter are amazing the spaghetti and meatballs were to die for the meatballs literally melt in your mouth i want to go back and try everything on the menu spoiler alert after the meal the owner came to our table and asked us to guess a number between 1 and 99 you get the number and dinner is free we didn t win but it was a fun game and a nice way to end the meal i will be back i am anxious to try lunch and the pizzas they are selling out the back
  tilapia tacos rule
  unpretentious and as truly italian as you will find in arizona i wasn t real hungry so i chose the steamed clams with white wine sauce it was outstanding great service with reasonable prices it is a little difficult to find your way to the parking lot but it is well worth the effort
  make reservations ahead of time otherwise you may have a very hard time getting in or get turned away even with reservations you may need to wait up to half an hour our group of 3 did but it went by quickly and we got a free drink out of it we had tarragon bison tongue amazing the sauce that it is in has some really distinct flavours duck in a can presentation is great the duck itself was delicious some people on here don t seem to have glowing reviews of it but i thought it was great the duck is cooked just right and the sauce is absolutely delicious pied du cochon this was very good i am not sure if i would order it again because i am a fan of rich full flavours and this had that but not to the level of some of the other menu items
  very happy to review this place after so many visits it may not look like much with no seating and a deli like set up but the food is something that really temps fulfills the soul first off the quality and authenticity is truly something to be admired i have always been impressed with everything i ve received my personal favorites are ahi limu ahi wasabi and ahi kimchi although the sauce base is used for most or all of the ahi poke i believe each one is still unique and nothing short of flavor come in early and they are more than happy to let you sample anything to your interest or liking when fresh product is still available around noon or so also they do military discount which is a great deal for such quality customer service is so personable and warming really makes you fee like you are walking into their home one of my favorite places for raw fish anything
  very few restaurants manage to balance price and quality as well as zen fusion very reasonable prices with excellent service and great food try the paella you will not be disappointed
  the crab bisque was odd the waiter placed a few pieces of crab on a plate and then poured the bisque onto the plate wasn t what i expected also ordered the crab stone claws and the bone in ribeye i asked for medium well and it came out rubbery crab was just alright
  this location had turned over so many different restaurants you wonder if native will make it but it does seem to have found the right type of crowd for this location have been eating at native for a long time when it was at various locations and hit the nights when they had the specials like the current tuesday 0 35 wings how can you go wrong at that price i think i liked the wings more in the past when they did not have a crust on the wings i always order the mild and the salt pepper the asiago parmesan are also good have had the pizza and burgers which are also good this is s good place to watch a game while having wings and drinks there are tv s every where and a separate dining area from the bar area located close to wangs it is very accessible with plenty of parking the staff is always helpful and friendly as long as the have the tuesday 0 35 wing night i will come back
  lately i tend to go back to a place a few times before giving a review and pizza people pub is no exception to this recent trend on my first visit i came during their opening week for a downtowner s lunch uye they had 5 specials this week on many of their pizzas and salads of course we all ordered two items and left over stuffed that particular day the salad was so tasty that i might actually be willing to admit that i liked it more than the pizza whaaat did i just say that out loud for the super bowl 2014 pizza people put out a pizza appetizer and salad buffet best pizza buffet in town i ve seen them do a pizza buffet once or twice since and it s worth every penny of the 15 or 20 per person they charge for it i ve been back for a random lunch once or twice since and the quality is always good but still not my favorite pizza in town if you love salads i would suggest you come here order a salad and leave ecstatic that you just had a fantastic salad if you re here for the pizza everyone has their own opinion and everyone seems to have their own favorite this isn t my personal favorite but i d never say no if friends wanted to go here for the random lunch or dinner happy yelping phoenix if you haven t yet picked your favorite pizza in phoenix and even if you have be sure to stop by pizza people pub
  went to lunch with my family at smashburgers first time here and was very pleased the food was great the service was exceptional the restaurant is very clean i would definitely recommend and visit again
  love this place great lunch special for pizza and a drink for 5 go there all the time and the owner is extremely pleasant
  awesome place for indian food try it you ll love it best lamb gyro in a long time
  i came here because word of mouth i ordered a half order of garlic knots a large pizza topped with sausage and mushrooms and an order of the sausage stuffed chicken wing i also tried the grilled rosemary lemonade that came with in a mason jar the garlic knots was perfect with a flavor of rosemary next time i ll order a full order the pizza tasted delicious and fresh the cheese was superb i also loved that there were puzzles toys and a chalk board for my two little girls to play with so it was very family friendly great eatery and will have to come back for more
  place was clean for the most part paid 20 for two dinner meals and two drinks we had the beef broccoli and the garlic chicken both meals were good but not great both the beef and chicken had a different texture almost like it was imitation service was a little wanting as well we got what we paid for and even that seemed a little too generous over all fair
  honestly i m very upset right now very very upset it s friday night and i wanted to get something a little nice for my parents and brother to have for dinner i drive the 20 minutes it takes me to get to this firehouse i order and the girl behind the counter tells me it ll be a 15 minute wait there was no one there but i let it slide i had no where else to be they re done on time i ll give them that but as soon i get home and give them to my family i see that they didn t even make them right i ordered a hero with no ham they put extra ham it says no ham on the receipt i ordered 2 of the cheddar briskets with no mayo the one has mayo and they forgot the cheddar and bbq sauce on the other really seriously i paid 10 a piece for those damn sandwiches i drove out of my way to get them it already took way too long for those girls to make them and they do it wrong i hope they lose their jobs this is ridiculous and unacceptable they re probably the same age as me early college years i know exactly what it s like to work in food and customer service if i had done that i wouldn t have a job right now i m never going to that location again and i m definitely calling there tomorrow to speak with the manager all you do is make sandwiches it can t be that hard to get my damn order right especially when i m far more than polite and understanding to you
  i must say the service is terrible we were a party of 7 but one of us was a baby so we bought 6 ayce lunches the quality of the food is average but the service fell far below average we would wait 15 20 minutes in between each order and they only refilled our drinks once throughout the whole meal at the end they included the tip for our 6 meals i was alright with the included tip but usually included tips for casual dining places like this establishment only charge like 12 18 included tip for fine dining but this place had an included tip of 20 for 6 people i believe they counted the baby and they didn t specify it anywhere or not anywhere convenient i left feeling ripped off especially for the service highly doubt i would return and i wouldn t recommend
  where should i begin hard to say i think i should begin by the good quite obviously the neighbourhood is looking for a place like this serving non pretentious food with a relaxed home y atmosphere and friendly staff we came to eat brunch today and the first thing i noticed was the line up at the door a tell tale sign of something there a need for though having a line up a relaxed atmosphere and a nice setting gets you a line up it doesn t guarantee you repeat and loyal customers at this point of my review if you are the owner operator or employee you might be saying to yourself what basis does this customer have to offer any criticism towards my restaurant let me answer that by saying i have been working in the restaurant hotel industry for the last 15yrs and i have seen the good and the bad your establishment falls somewhere in between now on with the not so good please take this as constructive and nothing else i am not here to bash i am writing this in the hopes that this might help your restaurant cafe have a long fruitful life the seating process was dealt with nicely we were promptly seated with a sense of urgency the table layout was a bit confusing it didn t look well organized i understand wanting the maximum of seated clients at one time but if the staff could not handle that many seated you should remove a few tables and encourage more tales being turned over our waitress took our coffee order after 10mins of being seated this should be something that s delay with as soon as the client is seated thus minimizing the perception of waiting times also let me say that a table just wanting a simple filter coffee doesn t want to wait 10 mins to get an alongee with a minimum investment for a drip coffee machine you could satisfy these clients after our order was taken i noticed the dishwasher with a cigarette non lit in his mouth in the kitchen area this should not be permitted near or around the food lit or not during the wait time for our food approx 30mins i noticed our waitress chatting with a friend at the bar and walking around aimlessly with no sense of urgency i saw some of her tables have to get up walk to the back and pay at the cash instead of at the table because of this though the other waitresses looked like they were bustling maybe we just got unlucky with our pick when the food arrived it was good the only thing not excusable was the burnt potatoes on the fritata dish not slightly burnt they were petrified and non edible the advice i could offer to shorten wait times for the food would be either invest some money into more updated kitchen equipment or construct a new condensed menu to handle the kitchens abilities i noticed the staff is working off an old 6 burner stove with 3 of these burner being taken up by a make shift steam table this leaves 3 burners for everything else this cannot suffice to feed a full restaurant in a reasonable amount of delay now let me finish by saying congratulations to own a business where there is a line up out the door for there offering is the dream for any owner operator i hate to say it though if some things are not adjusted and or invested that line up could dwindle away quickly we will be back to eat eventually and i hope to see the line up twice as long and i hope to be waiting in it to be seated again regards
  worth the triple d hype we always stop here when we drive cross country i think we ve been here 4 times total they have moved into a larger building and their competition around the corner puts a sign up across the street to lure the hungry waiting patrons away from matt s nice tactic but i will say this place is worth the wait everything is fresh real homemade doesn t get better i always get the pancakes the chop and chick is good too their home fries and coffee are great fresh preserves on fresh bread just go to there it s great
  by far the best sushi in cu i wouldn t go anywhere else service sets this place apart servers are efficient friendly and accommodating someone is always available to answer questions about the rotating rice wine sake menu fish is always fresh here and they are generous with sashimi sizes i don t think that they have the largest selection most unique rolls but the ones they have are quality and beautiful it s a small space but we ve never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table once in you will completely forget that you re in the middle of green st save for all the students around you perfect vibe and decor for the food served even the soy sauce dispensers are great
  we ve had both delivery and take out for both lunch and dinner and the food is always predictable good will definitely keep eating here and priced just right
  mitchell s has upped its game adding a 24 tap system with 20 rotating crafts the prices are reasonable for a downtown establishment and a great place to go if you are parking and walking to an event at consol or hopping the t to heinzfield or pncpark they also hired a new chef he is formerly of the urban tap and brought a new and inventive menu with him the classics that mitchell s was famous for are still here but the menu compliments the changes they made that the front of the house one final note the bar area is non smoking during the day great for business lunch or happy hour but becomes smoker friendly later in the evening highly recommend mitchell s
  their ham and bacon sandwich didn t disappoint it was delicious and different the waffle wasn t soggy at all just light and crispy and a little chewy the pumpkin waffles with whipped cream were great also the prices are very reasonable 5 99 for a sandwich i might have to go back tomorrow to try their fruit sandwich or waffle pizza
  i have found a new teharu and i am in love again i will never go back to the one on ray but i will drive the extra 15 miles anytime for this location plenty of everything no loud obnoxious crowds and the staff actually pay attention i got my tea refilled that may sound like a dumb statement but it would take me getting up and getting my own at the other location keep it up
  i just want to say again that i had another exquisite visit to the house i was invited to a bridal shower on december 29th the patio could not have been more comfortable or inviting it truly felt like we were at someone s home i was so amazed at how much i enjoyed the food i was still so stuffed as i tried to taste more of the shared pork dish only on sundays and it s accompaniments the service was stellar i would recommend hosting an event here anytime
  i ve been here twice already very impressive with the taste of their food and the environment i like their spicy intestine in hot plate
  they got two out of three orders wrong and the service was horrible it took over 20 minutes to get our check i am done with this cheesecake factory
  small plates in a hotel this sounds like a recipe for crappy food at a high price i was surprised to find the food here is really good but when you throw on the hotel prices it s getting up there with some of the big players in canada for that i had to bring the score down as it s good but you can get much better in the amazing gastronomical city of montreal for the same style of food the service is great as well as the atmosphere if you re looking to impress the ladies then this might be a place to do it otherwise i d steer clear of here for those occasions
  top notch caring staff for what they serve at all hours of the day never a let down i eat here whenever i need a cooking break now
  jolene our waitress was phenomenal food was great appetizers superb but az s loss to osu put a damper on the evening i d recommend four points for beer certainly as well as for food
  happy hour thursday 5ish party of 3 restaurant was fairly empty first timer sat on patio we ordered pomegranate and strawberry margaritas rose garden beer marguerita pizza deviled eggs and chicken nachos mind blown the deviled eggs were the best thing i ve ever tasted the chicken nachos were huge and worth every penny the pizza was good to one i ll be back for sure
  the waitress was chinese and she was so helpful and i ordered orange chicken and fried noodles i think the fried noodles is a better choice and it s pretty good and i will come there to eat more chinese food the single in the restaurant is bad i can t call in side and the wifi won t that good i suggest to eat near the door
  i ll have to agree with most of the comments it s a hit or miss the first time i ate here i was thrilled to finally have a good sit down pizzeria close to home pizza was delicious but service sucked i decided to give it a second chance but after the second time i won t be back pizza was not as good as the first time and service was still the same oh well no angelina s for me
  service was exceptional this evening and the food was awesome appreciate all the other great reviews that led us here to begin with a definite place to stop for greek food
  their poutine was the best that i have tried i also had their bbq wings it was expensive but still very delicious
  amazing we shared the pad thai holy basil chicken the papaya salad and super soup thai hot is legit
  the pizza is surprisingly good and they have rogue dead guy ale as well which is a mean feat in these ol carolinas umm anyways don t fear the potato pizza it s good and you ll like it
  well i was standing in line behind an older woman who was trying to decide what to get then her 3 friends showed up joined her cut in front of me and one of them starting grilling the poor kid behind the counter about how she knows good bbq since she s from kansas city one of the older women turned to me after about 5 minutes and said we just cut you huh it s not rynos fault i just thought it was interesting no one said anything from the staff i didn t take into account on my rating i got the pulled pork brisket mac and cheese and sweet beans the meat comes dry meaning no sauce the meat itself was not dry and extremely tasty and smokey the sauces were both good and i found myself wanting more hot sauce i got it to go overall the meat wasn t bad my only take away was that it s pulled brisket they don t advertise that i wanted a cut of brisket when i went out on my bbq lunch adventure so i was a little disappointed there the meat was priced fairly i read that the mac and cheese was pretty good so i got two small sides let me tell you they are small 2 50 for a sample sized side i can get bigger samples at cold stone that was my first knock the mac and cheese is great and i think they gave me their spicy beans instead of sweet because my mouth is still on fire while i was waiting for my food i read that the soda machines had duct tape on them which they didn t but the iced tea machine had two band aids in a x on one of the flavors yikes i don t want to see band aids while i m about to scarf down food overall the food was good i ll be back again for the meat but no sides
  one of my hands down favorite places in charlotte great food great beer great service you must try the pulled chicken sandwich with dinosaur sauce and of course the famous pretzels with beer cheese wether you feel like sitting inside or outside you re bound to have a wonderful time they ve got life sized chess connect four jenga plus a massive patio and volleyball courts outside it s all around an awesome experience
  we go here at least once a month if not more however no longer will that be the case deciding to go here for my birthday breakfast we come in and get seated in the back by the kitchen being an non average looking couple we expect that seating placement by the kitchen to be from places who really don t want us there i should of used my experience to know this was the first red flag and leave took a long time for anyone to come over to get our drinks i guess its really hard to see an odd looking couple in the back corner by the kitchen finally the manager comes over and asks if we were served yet nope so he took our drink orders and came right back with our drinks then we waited and waited and waited finely our waitress comes over and takes our orders being my birthday i was really craving crepes its something i only get on special occasions i was really excited to get them it was closer to lunch time so my husband ordered a sandwich she took our orders and left us to wait wait wait waiting bummer the service is so slow today i was in no hurry so i could wait bet those crepes are going to be great about a good 25 minutes later our waitress comes over with my husbands sandwich and before she places it on the table she informed me that there are no crepes left and will be an additional 15 minutes before they could get any more and make them wait what ran out on my birthday of all days couldn t you have told me that 45 minuets ago before we put the time in the sit there and enjoy the village inn kitchen ambiance really my husband refused his sandwich and we left so disappointed on my birthday too sigh
  you must come here if you come to vegas totally like a traditional beerhall in germany don t forget your shots you need to get spanked here this place is so much fun and the band gets you singing and enjoying your time even more you re compelled to meet your neighbors at your table and all have a great time i ll tell you this if you are in a group just get a few dishes the portions are huge and the beer steins are huge if you are with one other person get one dish forget the whole touristy stigma of a beerhall in vegas you are in vegas do it sing and drink and eat with your friends you will have the best time here
  excellent food just like their sister restaurant someburro s i was expecting table cloths and waiters there were waiters but it was definitely casual the service was great we were there at lunch on a sunday and were pleasantly surprised to find happy hour and a lunch menu in effect margaritas were tasty and on special discount for margarita day all in all very pleasant experience the only complaint i had was that the chips complimentary and passable but someburro s has better come in a little basket with a paper liner the basket was stained with old caked on salsa everywhere sides top bottom they looked dirty and i am not sure they could be cleaned someburro s is much closer to me and much cheaper for dinner so i would opt for that normally and especially at dinner
  great food great atmosphere the hawaiian ribeye is my favorite and don t for get the hot fudge sunday
  i would say this place is very nice and the customer service is top notch they have the best tapas that i had in long time the owner ryan is great he is very friendly i would suggest this place to any one who is looking for good tapas and chill and drink beer and wine i will be returning soon here
  i still think this is a great place for lunch this review is for their dinner service the porch does best with things like pizza and sandwiches relatively simple lunch food the dinner menu includes some full plate entrees it is here that everything falls apart i ordered a plate of salmon the fish itself was merely passable a little dry it was presented with some sort of eggplant goo and some stir fried greens kale i love eggplants and green vegetables but these three ingredients completely did not play well together as another reviewer also mentioned at night time the space feels a little dark and dingy as opposed to intimate and romantic the service pace was also off everything was slow but not in a well managed sort of way e g long stretch of wait time between seating and drinks being served and no the restaurant was not busy that night so the lesson i learned stick to lunch
  they are just great great food great taste simply their food is just amazing if you like the persian food you must try it
  prepare to pay 10 dollah for parking across the street unless you happen to be parked elsewhere for a concert or game not for the the girlfriends wives dressed to kill in matching sexy stilletoe heels because prepare to hobble food is usual bar and grill food ambiance is standard double jumbo tron projection tvs and multiple smaller flat screens blaring the game of the day svc is standard good for the creepy old midlife crisis men who ogle young twenty somethings dressed in mini skirt kilts and unbuttoned tight shirts food is rather decent if you send back your food to the kitchen to have it reheated or re done that usually gets the management s attention to make it right and bring it back faster otherwise prepare to wait and wait but for the average customer here just to watch a game one barely notices i never did receive my order of famous galric fries because they forgot to bring my order and the steamed clams they brought out were icy cold and shriveled to tiny black nubbins when i asked them to taste for themselves they made a face and quickly brought out a brand new batch which were plump and tasty then why did it take 45 minutes for me to get my first order i didn t even get any alcohol drink it s one of those novelty themed sports bars where a guy goes for standard brew and some mediocre chow to fill some kind of psychological void while watching a game not a romantic date place for sure and not so much fun for the family with kids either unless one takes a bunch of boys here to celebrate their bar mitzvahs i went because my love so desperately wanted to see sunday football someplace different than zipps while i desperately wanted to have gourmet food and go shopping at a mall might as well drop your man off at this sports bar which can serve as a sort of day care center while the ladies make a run to the mall otherwise one is better off to go the local sports bar unless you want to shell out extra mulah for standard food and tv fare
  i looking for jimbo or leslie or any of the old crew please email me i been eating at manda since i was 16 yrs old in the early 90s i was a regular until moving away to the phoenix area after many trips back to vegas for jimbos sushi and to see family i was sad to hear the old place was closing until a new place was found i recieved an email from crystal i believe and was told the new location we headed to vegas for some sushi i was amazed when i walked in at the new look it was beutiful after going there for a few times when we were in town me and a few friends found out the hard way they were closed some time short after life threw me a bad one and i spent almost a year in one hospital or another from az to md and now left disabled for some time so my point is i lost touch with all of them over time i was told over a year ago that jimbo was at some place on decatur but i don t remember where if you can email me if you know where i can find jimbo i would treat you to sushi i m serious miss you guys so much you all were more than food to me and were a big part of me being raised and growing up in las vegas brokenrt gmail com
  what a wonderful place to have dinner our daughter found this place because it had alot of gluten free items the people who run this place are the nicest and most genuine people you will ever meet don t be fooled by the location in a strip mall the food was absolutely to die for talk about scandinavian home cooking at its best well here it is there are some real surprise dishes well worth the wait for them to cook just like you would at grandmas house wow what a treat this place was check it out
  honestly i don t like giving out 5 star ratings all that much i most definitely end up giving them out more than i think i should but usually it s because i find the restaurants or business to be great this place is not an exception and i think they definitely deserve 5 stars we were leaving a friend s house in anthem and were hungry for some sushi we noticed a new restaurant hiroba and decided on a whim to pop in and give it a try they had not yet had their grand opening we caught them in their soft opening i still don t think they ve had the official opening yet and we are very glad we decided to give it a try we ordered the snow white roll the jackpot roll a deep fried spam roll and some oyster shooters they were all delicious on top of the food being fantastic the prices were also very reasonable the rolls were about 7 each the oyster shooters were 4 50 each and the deep friend spam roll was on 2 95 i think maybe it was 2 50 either way it was cheap and delicious in short this is a great restaurant i highly recommend this place and i will definitely be coming here again myself very soon
  sometimes you have to try another location sarasota to appreciate your own local store i love this location helpful friendly and the deep dish is heaven keep it up guys some of your colleagues can t come close to the store on ray
  okay if you re in vegas eating on a budget i would highly suggest stopping in for at least breakfast i think we paid 3 95 for eggs your choice of either ham bacon or sausage potatoes and fresh tortillas how do you go wrong with that everything tasted delicious too maybe that s because we started drinking at 6am hahaha they do have 99 cent bloody marys during breakfast too so it s definitely a smart spot for a breakfast adult beverage it can get packed in here but even so we were greeted quickly our food took a little longer to get to us but for a complete meal under 10 dollars including tip out you can t be too picky making this a pit stop every time in vegas
  best burger in phoenix they have a great beer selection too
  we went here for lunch and ordered the daily paella it was amazingly delicious and we enjoyed seeing them make it over the open fire pit the lunch menu is limited so just a warning dinner gives you all the options of the tapas
  clean fun menu authentic menu and plenty of choices the first thing i noticed when walking in was how modern open and clean the restaurant is the menu is easy to read and includes some pictures as well the restaurant uses the basic plate meal concept often found in hawaii which simply means you have your entree plus two sides this is not traditional american bbq so don t walk in with this expectation the menu like hawaii is a fusion of several asian cuisines as well as unique hawaiian items like their spam appetizer with rice and seaweed i also recommend the seaweed salad for something different it s very refreshing and delicious i ve had a couple of meals there and also enjoyed the crisp fried mahi mahi and bbq chicken the prices are reasonable but slightly higher than your average fast food joint with good reason in my opinion try it for yourself
  oh macayo you are a part of my youth and i am destine to return to you the food is predictably decent drinks are reasonable service is good
  thai restaurants and i go way back if you are looking for thai food this isn t the spot for you i give it two stars only because the pork pot stickers were decent the servicers were attentive and it was a neat ambiance ordered spicy chicken basil no bueno all the food was very bland my husband had the crispy noodles with beef the meat was chewie grisly he asked for it spicy and they brought him a side of chili paste not sure why they couldn t make it spicy for him while preparing the food i won t be returning
  i ve been to a considerable amount of sushi places in las vegas and i have to say that this one is my favorite so far they don t have ayce but it doesn t matter to me i never do that anyway if you like edamame their garlic edamame is the best one i ve had at any sushi places you must get it as far as their sushi goes i never get rolls but i always get nigiri and their fish is super fresh
  best pho ever easily the best in arizona
  this looks like a typical new york pizza joint in manhattan in brooklyn and new jersey we have tables the glass counter the ovens no space a narrow counter on the side with a couple of stools if you refuse to stand up and eat your pizza i had a plain and also a veggie the pizza was good but not great unless you re from fargo nd you can take the pizza place out of new york but you can t take the pizza it is acceptable for vegas even good for vegas but it ain t new york pizza still if you happen to find yourself at the cosmopolitan a place i absolutely adore and you re on a budget you can get a slice or two and be perfectly satisfied budget is a dirty word at some of the other restaurants up there on floor 3
  well done tasty miso ramen spicy and great service too
  can t go wrong with panera their menu is big enough and tasty enough to pretty much eat every meal here i usually just go for lunch lately i have been doing their pick two option for lunch so 1 2 salad and 1 2 a sandwich or 1 2 a sandwich and a cup of soup mix and match it was a little crowded today i thought the rain would force everyone to stay indoors so there was some jockeying going on for tables since it was also cold outside had a bowl of warm broccoli cheddar soup with half a tuna sandwich on honey wheat hit the spot
  as some one who has been coming here for years i can tell you the items on the menu are hit and miss my family loves the baked spaghetti pizzas calzones pizza muffins and eggplant parm i ve had several of there other pasta dishes eg alfredo and was not a fan you just have to know what to order from there the pizza and calzones are awesome
  best buffet and definitely worth it we went here for lunch buffet the selection was overwhelming great food the desserts were to die for service was excellent this place is a must go definitely going back next time in vegas
  if juan jaime was from mexico he would be totally embarrassed to eat what they call mexican in this tacos and tequila joint i ordered some tacos one with carne asada one with pork and one with chicken you could not make a decent taco out of these three no flavor no juiciness no taste whatsoever the black beans were dry and tasteless so was the rice juan if you can hear me please tell your people they need to educate themselves on real mexican food after all it is your name that it is at stake a good place to go and familiarize with true authentic mexican food is los reyes de la torta mexican food at its best i dare you juan to check it out
  that s some dang good coffee wow friendly staff too it s a bit expensive but they use local products and they re like the corner coffee shop so i don t mind definitely worth checking this place out
  the red chile mango steak salad is one of the top 5 best salads i have ever had if not 1 the combination of steak blue cheese spicy walnuts tomatoes and fresh chunks of mangos provides a flavor combination that is out of this world sweet spicy salty savory all it one delicious salad what could make for a better lunch the service is pretty good the cornbread is hot and the margaritas are worth every penny go there for lunch or for the bloody mary bar on saturdays only at this location or sundays their brunch menu on the weekends is also one of my favorites plus if you sign up for z tejas emails you ll get a 10 coupon to use during the month of your birthday
  finally was able to find a location around after watching all these golden corral commercials the price is pretty cheap for the amount of food you get it isn t the best i mean we are not in vegas here but not bad and a good enough variety came during lunch but wish we came around 330pm so that we could be around for the dinner menu in my opinion it is better than home town buffet luckily i came when there was no line but place was still pretty pack my niece especially love the cotton candy in her mind it is the best buffet around just because it has that definitely will be coming back
  hubert keller is an instant hit with me dwelling in san francisco for only a year and a half of my life was an increscribale twist in the direction my world headed i guess that is why i am drawn to chef s from sf i have been eyeing this place after seeing a piece on the travel channel nestled between a bunch of chic stores art galleries and bars i dug it i was totally pleased with the menu setup 4 basic burger types with all the sides sold separately on the side milkshake beer lists as well were very very detailed great touch the surroundings were causal but people seemed touristy and business suit types i would see this gem as a great place to get around midnight after one too many cocktails or after a day at moorea beach the adult pool i ordered the buffalo burger with caramelized onions bacon swiss cheese the zucchini fries and the skinny fries they are a separate charge from the burger tried the 5 beer sampler and a wheat hoegarden left a little tipsy and the perfect amount of fullness job well done burger bar
  great music good food and nice intimate ambiance love this place every time loving the band
  this place does serve some pretty good pizza the atmosphere though doesn t look all that great i do like though is that they do have pictures around the place that do scream out america any kind of pizza that you order would be good
  everything is good except the price i feel like these items are as good as the other dim sum places and don t need to be as expensive plus this hotel isn t all that either lol but on the bright side i do very much enjoy the sticky rice green tea filled dessert i also enjoyed the shrimp shumai
  i was a little worried because the place is on the fancy side and i wasn t dressed for the occasion i sat at the bar anyhow the server was so pleasant and helpful with food and wine suggestions i ordered the shrimp and chips the shrimp was huge literally the biggest i d ever had or seen in my life my friend even joked that it was fake lol also they have a house ketchup that s to die for they could totally give heinz a run for their money the food was well priced too the wine on the other hand was much more than i anticipated 11 for the glass i had at any rate i would go again but i ll be getting a cocktail this time and some ketchup to take back to nyc
  if you re looking for good indian food that cooked with soul this is the place to go everything about our experience here tonight was fabulous we ordered the lamb chops and a chicken saag spinach a great combo to share with two they provided a complimentary papadum basket for a apparently standard 15 min wait to make the chops the mint chutney was delicious and who am i to complain about complimentary papadum the chef also went out of his way to make an off the menu dish when i described a particular roti i have eaten elsewhere in the past this was spectacular even better than the naan i d say and perfect for eating with the saag spinach our waitress gena was very friendly and helpful to select our dishes the rest of the staff was courteous and attentive i m really glad to find this gem in my neighborhood the waitress spoke the absolutely truth when we initially arrived and discovered it was our first visit to the restaurant saying you will definitely come back again
  all i m going to say about this place is that i ve seen the workers multiple times in the trash area at kierland commons storing preparing food back there items included lettuce heads breads and macaroni and cheese disgusting i m not making this up unfortunately i contacted health services about this and when someone came to inspect the trash area there was no food back there i along with co workers noticed this on the daily back in high school when i worked at cold stone
  have been wanting to try this place for a long time as i love a good byob the food here was great the flat bread started was amazing fish and chips great as well the only downside here was the atmosphere on a crowded night you can be seated pretty close to other groups in my case it was a loud and obnoxious group sitting 2 feet away that being said cafe du jour in the southside still has my vote for best pittsburgh byob
  very happy with this place our server diena was really good we had a party of ten six kids four adults all with different orders our server got it perfect the food was really good value was much better than then expected i didn t care for the choice of music in the background or the gaming at its he bar restaurant was very clean we will visit again next year when we are in town i do recommend this place
  i came here twice within one week we ordered lamb curry and butter chicken with naan the first time and samosas naan 2 orders of lamb curry the latter the first time was a saturday evening and it was busy taking us close to 45 min to get our food but goodness everything was fresh i would wait that long again the curry was labeled mild but had a lot of spices and seasonings which made it great service was nice but best of all were the prices amazing meal with quality and portions but won t break the bank
  love the bagels the service is great coffee not so great but i hear that the ice coffee is good
  i came here for a large dinner with a fixed menu so i m going to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt when i say that that s probably why our food wasn t great the one highlight was definitely the moscow mule cocktail which wasn t part of the set menu delicious to start they brought out bread that was completely cold i m not sure if this is normal or not we had some hummus and pita which was ok cesar salad was ok but not very flavorful i had the corn ravioli which i thought was oddly thick in terms of the pasta itself almost as if it wasn t cooked properly the sauce and inside of the ravioli was also not impressive my boyfriend had the halibut which was pretty dry and fishy and the couscous underneath wasn t great either for dessert we had a chocolate lava cake which oddly didn t taste very strongly of chocolate i don t really want to come back and try this place without a set menu just because this experience was pretty disappointing and i know this place is pricey
  four of us tried this restaurant 11 14 15 we had been to pampas planet hollywood countless of times so it was fitting that we would compare bertolucci to it service at bertolucci was a lot better we all agreed that the meats served on our table at bertolucci were tastier and cooked just right the buffet table at bertolucci had plenty of choices the caesar salad dressing seemed to be from a bottle and the beef soup labeled erroneously as chicken soup was too salty however the chicken salad coleslaw warm chicken dishes fried corn bread on the buffet were good overall we recommend this neighborhood gem to those visiting las vegas
  sooooooooooooo glad they finally came to arizona it s a ride for us on the west side whenever we are in that area have to stop in
  our first find on yelp in montreal thank you yelp chicken with everything and more of what i read on ratings fresh slaw killer chicken and whoever is reading this get the fries its worth every calorie
  they should move the oyster bar in here
  a puppy amongst dogs i had a the chance to get to bad dog s this past saturday for lunch i can t exactly tell you why my gf and i decided to go to bad dog s maybe just looking to try something off the beaten path and not your average dog we arrived there a little after 1pm walked down into the bar and set up shop at the bar the bartender was a polite dude took our drink orders immediately had menus ready for us and was ready and willing to take our orders whenever we were ready ordered the chicken quesadillas see pics my gf ordered the bad dog burger which is basically a bacon cheeseburger see pics the quesadillas were good not great they were about what you would expect for a bar of this nature my gf s burger was tasty as i took a few huge bites the maple flavored bacon added a unique flavor for sure the bill came to 20 17 see pics which is fairly priced for the quality of burger and size of the quesadillas we received keep in mind however that fries do not come with the burger which are 2 00 extra very tasty hand cut fries it still stinks that they don t just come with the burger but oh well hey this isn t the greatest food you will ever eat the actual bar itself isn t the classiest bar you will ever hang out in not as long as you know that going in then you should be ok the service is great the food is good not great there are plenty of drink specials from day to day bad dog s only fault if you can call it that is that it doesn t do anything to distinguish itself from the many other bars in the university area sorry to say but i look at bad dog s as a puppy compared to the big dog bars in the area such as b walks picasso s taco mac hickory tavern and others
  in the new cosmopolitan hotel in las vegas lays this fast fun hideaway sushi restaraunt fried chicken too yep my friends dad got it i sampled it with the fun sauce and it was fabulous this place has gotten an award best fried chicken says the ny times oh ya and the sushi was delicious too of course
  subtle seemingly simple dishes with pleasantly complex flavors this was the best meal i had in vegas to be honest it should also be noted that i hate olives but the olive butter was it butter does it matter was surprisingly good for being made of presumably 99 mashed olives the portion sizes were good also frequently in my brief visit to vegas the dinners were just huge and felt wasteful but not here
  i do recommend this place for their great breakfast dishes and gut busting sandwiches and i like the fact that it s not a chain restaurant like about 95 of the other eateries in surprise but i really do wish the breakfast cook knew how to cook an egg i have never had a medium well egg in this place a med well egg is flipped unbroken yolk yolk cooked to have a firm but wet appearing center i hate it when the egg white is runny and the only way to get an eatable egg at archies is to order a scrambled egg or a well done egg and my last complaint about archies is that sometimes the waitresses can get a bit distracted which means the service suffers a bit don t you just hate it when they never come back for a refill on your coffee other than those two issues this is a good place to visit for a good not great breakfast
  so i use to go to yogis a lot about 3 years back and the quality of the food as well as the service has gone down sadly i also noticed the portions went down as prices went up i hate that the lunch combo price went high as well still good but just not the same
  my friend in arizona recommended curry corner after finding it via the food network app overall the experience was good but i don t think i d return if i were in the area as i ve had better indian and pakistani food we arrived on a lazy sunday afternoon close to 12 and the place was quite empty we sat at one of the few small tables against the wall and began debating what we should order we started with an order of the tikka masala fries which i d seen recommended on yelp they were good especially the portions with feta cheese but i d recommend skipping them the fries were pretty soggy which is understandable but the tikka masala sauce wasn t very flavorful or spicy i ordered the vegetarian thali a combination of 2 vegetable curries lentils rice naan yogurt and a small salad it was good though the lentils were incredibly salty the standout for me was the yogurt dip which i found really refreshing the curries were good just not outstanding still the price can t be beat for the amount of food you get my friend ordered the arabic plate which is like the thali plates in that you get two kinds of curry hers had chicken lentils biryani rice hummus instead of yogurt salad and naan i liked these curries better than my vegetarian ones personally the oddest part of our visit was watching someone presumably an employee wander back and forth between the kitchen and cleaning the outdoor windows it made me feel slightly awkward about the potential for unsanitary conditions where my food was being made i d honestly skip curry corner but it s not a bad decision
  order the fried squash crispy it s great salads are fresh green leaf with cuke and cherry tomatoes not a bowl of iceberg shreds we also love the vegetable soup and all of the homestyle vegetables
  i did go back to this place after my first review and again i had really good service like the first time i liked the fact that someone was going around asking for suggestions on how to make the place better shows that they care about their customers it was just a first bad experience i definitely want to try the rest of the menu and my favorite beer victoria on draft
  i work 8 am to 6pm monday thru saturday with no lunch break constantly busy so when i need food i need it in a timely manner these guys always seem to pull through i call there and they already know my name and address from previous orders and they are definitely always freaky fast for me thanks guys
  i ve been here once recently for a business meeting it s a small little place that can be missed if you don t slow down your driving inside it is clean and quiet i ve only got coffee here once to get some quick work done and stayed briefly the coffee wasn t memorable nor do i recall if they have a signature coffee item so until i sample a few more i like to provide another followup review the service is what you expect of an independent coffee house it s neither systematic or mechanic like starbucks this place gives a feeling of being in a mature setting where harmony is preferred opposite of sitting out in the old days at counter culture cafe at night i would come back again when i m in the area
  i ve wanted to try the pho bang for quite some time vietnamese for me is inexpensive comfort food it s a great name also pho bang so i had to check out the noise to see what s it all about pho bang is as the name suggests is a busy restaurant maybe that s where the new york portion of the name comes in entering the place i was lucky to get a table right at the front the place was packed like grand central train station at 5pm packed tables close together and servers weaving around the place serving food in a very efficient and calculated fashion if crowded spaces are busy restaurants are not your deal then this is not your restaurant as in other hellacious busy vietnamese restaurants it s about efficient service and you don t come here for a server asking hello how are you doing honey it s order your food eat pay leave and come again don t screw with the system here or come in with inflated expectations perusing the menu they had wonderful pictogram images of their dishes most items under 10 i had selected a bun noodle vermicelli dish that was grilled chicken and beef with this i shared a plate of pork based spring rolls with my brother who i ate with serving size was a bit smaller for the vermicelli as mentioned by my bro but overall quality and flavour was excellent and fresh for the noodle bowl the spring rolls were crispy and filling inside was a mix of ground pork and veg overall a solid meal meal with tax and tip for the two of us was just shy of 29 which is awesome and one of the reasons i come for vietnamese this is a busy place the food is on the upper end of good and one of the copious viet places in chinatown
  i m sorry but i don t agree with bob not at all first of all it s a country themed texas style roadhouse with that being said everything that you would expect from that kind of a place the service was impressive hubby and i went there on mother s day with our daughter and the wait time was accurate 5 10 min and they were busy the appetizer came out very very quickly and piping hot too our salad came out quickly as well and just about every single employee that we walked by said thank you for coming in have a wonderful mother s day the manager even came over to ask how our meal was and it was great food a bit pricey though but huge portions we paid 80 dollars for 2 cocktails 2 steak combo dinners and an appetizer but what we would expect from a traditional roadhouse overall wonderful experience and we will be going back there
  best pizza
  so i ve been meaning to come here because of many referrals from friends the staff was really welcoming my waitress alex was very nice and made the whole experience the food was amazing i ve been to a lot of ramen joints here in vegas and this place definitely on my top 3
  i have had better pad thai tom yum and dumplings nothing special here it was like an expensive fast food chinese place plenty of other places i would go to
  my boyfriend and i have been coming to la gourmandise for three years now since it opened i think it is a little on the expensive side for breakfast which is what we usually go there for but it s a nice treat we usually get the la gourmandise omelette which is amazing recently they ve also upgraded to larger portions so one entree really fills a person up their ingredients are always fresh and the service is friendly i ve noticed a lot of confusion about the french german mix of the cafe and we actually asked the owner about it a while back it s really his parents dream and one of them is french the mom i believe and the other is german they wanted to do a fusion of their two culture to celebrate so many happy years of married life such a sweet story
  all the seasoned food taste two kind too sweet or too spicy i love korean bbq but not in this place
  came in with my father and place was great definitely something new out there now super great service by staff as well recommend any one who is tired of the same food in vegas to check this place out
  i have eaten here in the past and the crab legs were pretty good well i guess they have gotten cheap and replaced the normal crab legs with a blue crab idk it was horrible horrible horrible i felt totally taken advantage of the rest of the food was not that good either bland no taste and just plain nasty fruit flies every where you could hardly enjoy your food even if you did like the food i normally don t go this far with reviews but this was just horrible i know it s a buffet but that does not mean you have to serve the poorest quality of food oh and to top it all of i have been double charged for this horrible meal believe me i won t be back oh and i think it s time for a upgrade this place looks old and outdated so disappointed but at least our server was nice and attentive
  awesome pizza and good pasta and the pizookie is gnarly i wish there was one in san fran
  i visited the octagon cafe during my visit to az with my fiance and we had a wonderful time we chose to sit out on the patio as it was a beautiful day and the view of the gigantic fountain is breathtaking the food is fantastic i had the chicken salad which i was told it is a homemade recipe it was delicious the iced tea is amazing as well be sure to try both flavors they have a full bar and beer on tap including stella which is one of my favs the staff are friendly and the owner jim takes time to great every one who enters and made us feel right at home if you find yourself in fountain hills do yourself a favor and check out the octagon cafe
  delicious i was pleasantly surprised to discover this poutinerie right in my neighborhood from the outside it appears quite boring and i would never have thought to go there but a friend had recommended it to me the poutine was pretty delicious and they had lots of options for adding veg and meat if that gets your wheeling turning i enjoy my poutine in the classic fashion and i thought their cheese was very good and that the portion size excellent they have a student discount and are open till 4am on weekends also they have loads of flavoured mayonnaise to choose from which i used to cover every fry not already drenched in gravy mmmm
  great atmosphere and chris w was a fantastic waiter not to mention easy on the eyes for these two texas girls looking for a local eatery the cheese plate fried green toatoes and salad that we split were awesome finally also a place that makes a good dirty martini yummy
  the restaurant is for some reason divided in two fancier upstairs we walked on unknowingly to the top floor i wanted the catfish sloppy joe but that was for the lower level service 6 10 waiters gave us the downstairs menu after asking good waiters but no single waiter was the lead this led to repeat questions one waiter told us 2 sex jokes not professional but they were funny food 7 10 catfish was fair sea bass was good ambiance 8 10 nice and relaxing cleanliness 9 10 very well kept
  best sandwiches everrr going to vegas with my best friend for the first time as 21 year olds oh heeeeyy we didn t only anticipate gambling and drinking but mostly where to eat this was number one on our list especially since we stayed at planet hollywood what i love most about their sandwiches is the bread it s so light and soo yummy i ve tried the earl s club the full montagu tuna melt surprisingly super good and i m not even a fan of tuna and the italian personal fave the italian such good sandwiches you have no idea until you actually try them and they re cheap too can t wait to go back to vegas and eat here again
  one of my favorite spots for elite burgers i usually splurge on the high end beef cuts when i go to burger bar so i can t speak to the other products i love the gourmet options available the beer selection cannot be overlooked here i know many beer snob that frequent burger bar for some unique beers they get from time to time they always seem to have something wonderful to pour
  sandwiches are good if you like healthy tasting sandwiches like i do juices are really good service even though it s just counter service is sub par just walked of of there after waiting 15 minutes for a blended coffee drink off hours mid morning 4 girls working in the back well at least one busy checking her pink cell phone i was the only person that had an order pending the cashier saw me throughout those 15 minutes and didn t bother to make sure my order was started i had to go up to the counter to ask for a status and only then did they start my drink not the first service related frustration i ve experienced but the latest i ll continue going here because it s the only healthy restaurant within walking distance of my office and the food is decent
  food was so good the greek salad was well dressed and the feta cheese was a good amount service took awhile i do understand it s a friday during lunch time 30 minute wait for a salad i definitely will come back to try their other good looking foods
  i must say i was hesitant to try out this place after reading all the reviews but since this is the only buffet place in cesar s and i had dinner voucher for this place i decided to take the risk during the holidays they had special sea food special going on which include unlimited shrimps and crab legs the seafood was fresh and delicious and for me that was a deal maker in itself in general buffet i didn t find much variety i tried dim sum average fried rice average two kind of sushi below average salad bar baked fish average and 4 different kind of potato awesome off the hook the dessert bar was another deal maker for me because it consisted of about 20 different kind of desserts i think for 27 this place is definitely worth it especially if they have seafood platter as well the server practically ignored our table hence the three stars
  this choice for indian came from others reviews on yelp so i needed give my support i am visitor from a large city with many indian cuisine places to choose what a nice surprise to experience somethng not fast food or chain when i called to confirm if reservations were required i was greeted with a friendly response of time and number in the party the location is easy to locate the wait staff was quick as was the food one the people in my party was hesitant to try a dish the prices to much for experimenting but once the rest of the items were served she promptly ordered a dish to go
  this restaurant makes you feel special the staff are very polite and nice outside area is full of flowers and quiet you may forgot that you are in the middle of down town the main dish prepared artistically and it is super delicious do not forget to have dessert there tiramisu is well made
  so we were at work trying to figure out what to eat and passed over this place a couple of times soooooooo happy we didnt i got the chinco fries and the pastrami boyger it was the best lunch ive had it was soooo good they have a lot on the menu so i will have to return a few times just to be sure aha the cashier and the cook were nice also the establishment is a little small but i will definitely be returning
  add our names to the list of we came here strictly for the poutine were not disappointed we order a large la taquies sour cream tomatoes guacamole a small straight up vegetarian poutine both with veggie gravy la taquies was delicious but i m also glad we got the classic version as well the guacamole was more of an avocado spread but i know cilantro isn t for everyone so its probably better for the masses they achieved what i thought to be the perfect ratio of cheese curds to gravy to fries there s a split right after the door to separate people ordering take out from those waiting for a table fyi they don t have a liquor license for their patio but you ll be fine get drunk off how amazing your meal is
  a great new spot if you like good music and great drinks this is the new spot in chinatown
  located in mgm grand on the famous las vegas strip this newly re opened seafood restaurant is the latest in the emeril s dynasty this place is great here are the must tries alligator balls yes i said alligator balls the frog legs sort of served buffalo style bbq shrimp also everything from the raw bar is incredible i should also mention the tropical mojito usually not my thing too sweet but this thing was on fire live it up you are in las vegas for cryin out loud
  my husband and i went here last night for dinner and i booked the restaurant only because it had outdoor seating by the wynn lake i made the reservations on opentable over a week beforehand when we got there we were told that an outside seat would be an hour wait immediately i was annoyed because this is the reason i made reservations ahead of time and i requested a seat outside i ve worked in the restaurant business if you can t guarantee outdoor seating then make a note of that on reservations sites etc or don t overbook your patio if wait had been 15 30 minutes i would have been understanding and had gone to the bar to wait but an hour wait is ridiculous poor planning in my opinion dinner was pretty good my husband and i ordered a bottle of wine and got a dozen oysters to start usually at restaurants they will explain where the oysters are from etc at a seafood restaurant i would expect that an more nope nothing if i m paying 40 for oysters i d like to know a little bit about them and since i noticed we got 2 different kinds it would have been nice to have know the difference between the two i guess i ll ask next time next my husband and i ordered the specialty whole lobster from their 4 different choices offered they bring live lobsters to your table beforehand and explain where each one is from and the price per pound my husband got the scottish blue 160ish total for 2 5lbs and i went with the classic maine 100 2 5lbs we opted for the chili rub food arrived beautifully prepared butter came on a warming dish but flame underneath was not lit so butter got cold quickly my husband s lobster was perfect but mine had a little surprise waiting i started with the tail and once i started cutting into it there was a massive amount of slimey black dark green ooze coated on the inside of the tail the lighting was dim so i kind of ate the parts that weren t covered and finished off the claw meat i then asked the server what the black green slime was and he said it was roe meaning lobster eggs my lobster was pregnant he told me i was lucky that i got a lobster with roe however it s not what i ordered and was expecting plus it s slimey and not pretty to look at and there was so much it made it so unappetizing the server also said one time they had a live lobster that they picked up that had been oozing roe just before cooking he explained that it was apparently illegal for it to be sold in that condition i m assuming for ecological reasons but then why would you still serve that he also said i got a lot of it i was looking forward to dessert after dinner but because my lobster was not appealing at all i lost my appetite i m a huge fan of cavier but because lobster roe is slimey and black and there were huge gobs of it it was not something i found to be a delicacy and i did not feel lucky at all i didn t have the heart to tell them i didn t like it because i ate the claw meat and as much of the tail as i could muster despite some chewiness my husband looked up online regarding the situation and found different reviews regarding lobster roe being a delicacy and other reviews explained that usually the lobster should not be served if roe is found inside i felt really disappointed with our 500 meal won t be going back if you get lobster with roe make sure you put all your money on black then you re lucky i guess
  i have been going to los olivos for more years than i care to remember they still have the best mexican food in town and you can t beat the salsa
  they know how to treat you here everything is top notch excellent martinis steaks and sides generous enough to share with several people for our special occasion they threw in free desserts
  this place was well worth it i ve been meaning to eat here for a while now since it opened and my fiance and i finally made reservations the weird part is they only have reservations for 5 and 9pm the food is amazing i ordered the signature beef wellington and it was delicious i will definitely be making a trip out here again we also got to take a picture with the executive chef christina i had a great time and enjoyed everything
  our go to style restaurant with my boyfriend is any thai food restaurant we re suckers for a good thai tea _ anyways there was a good thai tea huge typical menu and moderately slow service like most are server was a kind smiley woman that checked in often they deserve five stars simple because it was a quite hole in the wall place we expected delicious
  this place is amazing i ve been told to come here by multiple people including friends from back home in oregon i love that not every burger is the same and they make it for you the way you want it the fries they have there are also very good and this place is defiantly worth stopping by
  skip the delivery go for pickup this has to be one of the most creative lobbies of a pizza place i ve come across 4 tvs with one always on nick jr my 3 year old appreciates that not to mention a basketball hoop hula hoops and other fun things to keep you occupied that is to say you won t be waiting forever for your pizza typically just a few minutes but a fun atmosphere to be in the food oh yeah it s solid great specialty pizzas including the buffalo chicken pizza and the taco pizza not too many places make a taco pizza around here this place does and it s great it s a great choice for the family while it may not be the cheapest place in town it s a great choice
  can i just say never would i have imagined i would fall in love with a mushroom burger and i m not talking about a portabello slapped between 2 pieces of bread if you ve seen ground turkey or veggie patty that s how this burger was made and whatever was used to keep it altogether was awesome my friend had the pasta dish but it was a bit dry perhaps eating at 330am would be one of the reasons for dry pasa i don t know but i would stick with the burgers at those times i even had breakfast and was happy to see that their food was consistently good overall and went back to have another burger the next day at a casino cafe don t expect great service nor fast however the staff at this location was efficient quick and tried to get to all customers as quick as possible this location has a better setup than the palazzo so if you were like me and stayed at the palazzo perhaps stay at the venetian shorter walk and open 24 7 i ate at the palazzo location and the mushroom burger is the same at both but as for the rest of the food you ll have to be the judge i plan to try the la location of this establishment hopefully the food is up to par like in vegas
  solid food and service they took care of us even though the kitchen was about to close the shredded pan fried chicken and moros was great and is recommended
  ya no i have been here so many times i cant count when i visit bww i get the same product every time if the place is packed sure the wait is a little long but the cold beer makes up for it i have always had the game i wanted turned on and theres a shelf for beer at the golden tee machine 3 words wings sports beer dont be a baby
  every year i go to miami for winter music conference i have been lured to go eat at sushi samba over on lincoln but i have never had the chance to eat there not sure why maybe it always seemed to packed and i didn t want to wait i know now that i missed out on some damn good meals right before thanksgiving my wife and my father in law traveled over to las vegas for a few nights as we walked into the venetian hotel i saw a billboard for sushi samba at the adjoining hotel the palazzo and i knew then where we were going for dinner we went up to our room freshened up and headed out we were quickly seated it was a sunday night and the place was half full and placed some drink orders my wife had one of the specialty drinks which was quite good and i had some nigiri sake we started off with the otsumami appetizer which came with edamame shishito peppers and green bean tempura with black truffle aioli all 3 were excellent but we found ourselves fighting over the green beans and that yummy aioli next up was a mixture of ceviches and tiraditos we tried 4 all together with both salmon and yellowtail amazing flavor the yellowtail ceviche taquitos were also amazing i could eat those all day we also had a couple of things from the robata grill the stand out was the miso glazed sea bass it was incredible so tasty it was the best sea bass i have ever had period the peruvian corn that came with it also was quite tasty the waitress recommended the mushroom toban yaki with some grilled duck from the robata grill it was so intense and earthy i definitely got use of those umami tastebuds with this dish loved every bit after all that we saved room for 2 speciality sushi rolls the samba strip roll and the neo tokyo roll both were amazing and filled with different flavors all in all one of the best meais i have had in a while and i have had some amazing meals recently if in vegas you owe yourself do it
  ok
  i must say i did not fully experience this restaurant so i am only reviewing by the quality of their clam chowder and the little bit of service i received while i was in the establishment the chowder was so so it is the best i have found in the immediate area so it might be worth going to if you re nearby and have a craving however for the portion you get it in pretty expensive i have had better chowder at a lower price the service was old school no non sense i kind of liked it the atmosphere is pretty dumpy and kind of creepy i wouldn t recommend women walk across the parking lot alone in fact i might pack heat if i ever visit again some of the biker dudes next door were looking at me like they liked me
  holy crap the red velvet pancakes is some serious business it is amazing what s a better word for amazing orgasmic hahahaha i ordered the short comes with 3 pancakes we also ordered the kalua pig benedict which was also amazing never had a benedict like that before and it was evenly portioned out between the shredded pork and cabbage yanno how some places give you more cabbage than meat yuck but not babycakes the pancakes come with an amazing cream cheese syrup which completes the entree i was in heaven we split both entrees so it was a perfect amount got a little bit of dessert and regular food this is a must go to spot if you have a car the drive is worth it we didn t even have to wait because we went at the buttcrack of dawn but as time went on the place got really packed fast plus the restaurant is pretty small so i can see there being a wait also keep in mind they close at 3pm awww yah
  daaaaannnggg this place is great the bf and i wandered in friday night after attending mmoca nights courtesy of yelp thanks yelp we were strolling around the square feeling a little uninspired over the usual places hamilton s caught my attention out of the corner of my eye the exposed stone and cool lanterns over the bar made me think this is a place i want to sit inside of we walked over and saw a few open tables and assumed there would be a wait those open tables must be for reservations we figured nope we were seated right away and were able to score a table at the window the one seat had a gorgeous view of the capitol i was surprised to see the poor reviews regarding service both the host and our server were extremely friendly and prompt our server was one of the best and most friendly i ve had in awhile we ordered drinks rather quickly very nice list of cocktails with a few unusual selections and our server came back a few minutes later to let us know there would be a small wait because a bunch of people had just sat down at the bar no problem and thanks for letting us know the drinks were great i had the rum sour which was delightfully refreshing one of those drinks that tastes like vacation in a glass the bf had the manhattan which was quite strong but enjoyable for dinner i had the ricotta gnudi and wow just wow the gnudi were outstanding and the broth was perfect not an overwhelming squash flavor at all the broth was so delicious i would have licked the bowl clean if this was socially acceptable alas it is not luckily this dish is served with a spoon so i was able to scrape up as much as possible i m new to madison but those who aren t would know hamilton s is in the previous space which was the blue marlin in a nod to the past occupant the special saturday night was a shrimp diablo my dining companion had that and wow it was also excellent five decent sized shrimp along with some crazy delicious sausage crumbles in a cream sriracha sauce with penne yum yum yum it was exceptional we were both pleasantly surprised at how amazing our food was we will be back for sure the space is really more of a 4 star space and the food really outshines the ambiance i loved the exposed stone walls and lanterns it reminded me a little of chicago s violet hour but the other wall is a little odd and the music doesn t seem to quite go with the feel of the place it wasn t loud at all as other reviewers have written
  this place is good definitely affordable fine dining and i would recommend friends to stop by is it amazing and must try yes and no i m sure there are other vegas establishments more on the wow factor but pricewise for food and the experience yes please do visit i came here with a friend and were able to request and get a seat by the window that looks over to the bellagio water fountains pretty cool i must say the bread oh my they serve awesome bread here there was a piece of sourdough bread on top of the basket covering two pieces of warm wheat type bread two rosemary focaccia and our favorite cheese and salami wrapped bread this last one was soooooo yummy the awesome bread basket came with salted butter a tomato tapenade and olive oil oh my we finished most of the bread basket except the rosemary focaccia and had to ask for a second round of bread to accompany our meal yes that good the salami cheese bread was probably my most favorite thing for dinner lol i ordered the lobster pici which was good there were large pieces of lobster meat in it there better be if it costed 38 the pici was cooked perfectly nothing worng with this dish but tasted like something i could have made at home my friend ordered the ricotta and mushroom agnolotti this was really good i had a few pieces and the wrapper on the agnolotti was super soft it should be since they make their own spaghetti everyday my first choice for entree though was the duck and foie gras ravioli un lucky for me my other friend went to dinner before me and had some leftovers which i was able to try these little suckers were really good heated up so i can only imagine what they would have tasted like if i ordered at dinner and the plate set in front of me drools so i would recommend this dish definitely all in all a really good dinner the staff was all super professional accommodating and attentive good job staff
  about the only decent italian place in south charlotte and well worth the effort great service when we last dined in the bar at a high top and the wine is not too badly priced try the pasta fajiole and the lasgna
  none of their staff seems very excited to be there ever i have been here at all different times and it is always the same humdrum this last time i went with a friend of mine for a late dinner there was still 40 minutes till close so it was not like we skipped in at the last second you could tell the bartender was not too happy about us showing up he offered us drinks and i had to request a menu then he stood there staring at us while we decided what to order we ended up ordering 3 different kinds of tacos he failed to ask us if we wanted flour or corn tortillas and they came out with flour tortillas i am not a fan of flour tortillas it was just not a pleasant dining experience aside from my company i can say they have a great taco tuesday happy hour but otherwise i would never come here for anything else
  we were craving for some good indian food this was perfect destination the buttermilk was super awesome with mint in it totally recommend this place to anybody who loves spicy food
  great patio good happy hour love the carnitas tacos good drink selection interesting options had some jalenpeno margarita of some sorts nice upscale place with a very friendly comfortable atmosphere located in scottsdale quarter just east of brio if you turn in the parking garage off greenway parkway it is just to the left of the parking garage entrance
  this is now my favorite vietnamese restaurant in town i have gone here a few times after trying it for the first time earlier this month not only is the food delicious but the waitress was very nice she would make suggestions on how to dress up the food with the different sauces on the table she doesn t do tell you in a pushy way she is just being nice and helpful i highly recommend 29
  i ve been coming to habanero s since they opened they are the best and most authentic mexican spot in the scottsdale airpark the food is always delicious they have great service and great prices they have two locations in scottsdale now the other one is on scottsdale and shea
  as a las vegas local this is a must go to place when i have visitors in town pork belly steamed buns are soooo delicious
  let s just start by saying i m in such a wow from food to service to the environment my husband and i were here in las vegas for 2 months continuing to build our vacation home on new years eve we sat at the bar first time there friend recommended and this beautiful young woman approached us i believe her name was janna she was very attentive answered all of our questions and even suggested a red wine that would compliment what we were having for dinner we returned last night 1 9 and i was so happy to see her again she remembered what we had from appetizers down to the wine she is such a great spirit we hope to see her more and more when we visit from l a if you haven t tried echo rig yet you are strange
  premier hookah lounge friendly staff best shisha in pittsburgh nawa will see to your every need
  definitely recommend this place i study in mariano and close to this restaurant the manager was so patient i ordered butternut squash soup with coconut milk it was fabulous the crab cake was fantastic since i was alone and with small appetite i couldn t order a main anymore for dessert there were chocolate pot mousse and pudding cake with hot caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream heard pudding cake would come in big portion so i chose chocolate mousse the mousse was average definitely going to come back and try the jampon and the dessert
  good coffee breakfast sandwiches and tea selection much needed in north scottsdale
  ah fuel fuddle fuel fuddle was one of my college dining favorites but since i m no longer a student i wondered when i stopped in today if the place would be as good as i remembered it was woo a friend and i came by for dinner after a day at the museums and as previous pitt students the noise and collection of young diners didn t surprise us we just got our seat and raised our voices so we could hear each other as we talked while looking at the menu i was surprised by how many beers and ciders and whatnot they offered the last time i ate here i was under 21 so i didn t remember this at all i saw that the portobello sandwich i d eaten here previously was still on the menu ah good times but figured it would be nice to try a few other things so my friend and i each ordered a burger his made with regular beef mine a black bean patty and decided to split their rollafatty the rollafatty appetizer is basically two mini pepperoni rolls served with a side of sauce very greasy very cheesy and very yummy i m glad i split it though then our main courses came out on that were plates 100 covered by our food i think the burgers were pretty standard restaurant sized burgers and the other half of our plates were full with a mix of regular and sweet potato fries the fries while a bit salty were absolutely delicious so was my black bean burger the garden of eat n i love black bean sandwiches and appetizers in general and this one was covered in pesto sauce and mixed with other burger toppings very yummy i loved what i ate but ultimately left with about a third of my sandwich and most of my fries plus my friend s he didn t want them as neither of us could finish our entire meals i doubt we could have even if we skipped the rollafatty appetizer graduate or not i m definitely still a fan of fuel fuddle it s not fine dining but it s good pub restaurant burgers sandwiches pizzas salads etc and they have a great selection of drinks and the service is generally really quick given the crowds they bring in of course if you stop in while school s in session you will have to share your eating space with students so as long as you re ok with that i recommend stopping in to eat here sometime the sweet potato fries alone are worth it
