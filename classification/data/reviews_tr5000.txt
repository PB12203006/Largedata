  first time here food tastes great good environment choice between mimi s or here is a hard one yet there is wifi here families galore i didn t bring my son yet i see lots of families eating here for what you get you could go to sunset station yet the service was fast and prompt when i am in the area it s now a good place to fill in the answer to what do you want to eat
  i have been craving burgers lately so i decided to try smashburger for the first time i am definitely not coming back the food presentation seemed legit when the servers brought our food to the table but their burgers and fries were drenched in grease didn t even want to finish my food and my table was filled with napkins from all that disgusting grease service was alright janelle took our order was a tad bit rude she didn t greet us but kept interrupting me as i was putting in my order by constantly saying for here or to go i obviously couldn t hear her because she made no effort to speak up daniel was nice enough to come around our table with a smile as he was cleaning up asked how the food was for us to enjoy the rest of our day
  i love having a place like this in the neighborhood the new management has cleaned it up and added great things to the menu like vegan biscuits gravy which are delicious this coming from a meat eater and it s open until 4am on weekends which makes it the perfect spot for a late night snack
  i had the morning monte which was delicious i never would of found out about this place without yelp it s in a residential area off the main road don t let that fool you though the food was good and staff was friendly the outside area was nice and they even had a macaw
  i have this app on my phone that lists the places near you where kids eat free on specific days it s usually full of sub par diners but when i saw rumbi s listed i had to jump on yelp to see what people had to say mixed reviews so i took a quick peek at the menu it sounded good so we decided to check it out the restaurant was fairly clean and a few other families were eating when we got there we perused the menu longer than we usually do but we didn t feel in the way or rushed in any way they have everything from rice and noodle bowls to burgers to sandwiches to seafood it was hard to decide i ordered the fish tacos and polished off the whole plate in no time the order came with two tacos type of fish not specified and rice with beans i seriously ate it so fast that i can t tell you what all was in it pretty sure the salsa was tomato onion pineapple and cilantro there may have been cabbage and a jalapeno ranch type sauce don t quote me on it though the rice and beans were really good and scented but i couldn t pinpoint the flavor very good though husband had the kahuna burger two patties pineapple swiss typical burger toppings with the rumbi fries regular and sweet potato the burger fell apart as most doubles do he really enjoyed it though kids had the chicken dippers and the orange honey chicken bowl i was surprised that both kids polished their food off since dinnertime can be somewhat of a battle as we were finishing up it started to get busy so we got there at a good time right before 6pm i can t wait to go back
  in n out is great i love their burgers and fries they have friendly staff every time i go there i was there today and their food is very good for the money my 2 old year loves going there because he get stickers keep up the good work in n out
  a local favourite byob beer wine the restaurant served a very nice french meal the service was a bit slow the food was excellently prepared
  i had zee most elegant evening here with my bf we celebrated our 2nd year anniversary here first of all i have never in my life had any kind of service like this before proper etiquette and everything when we came in to claim our reservations the host called us by our last names like mr santos it was pretty amazing since it was both our first times here we got to our table and the host automatically pulled out my chair for me and bonus was that she pulled out the chair i prefer sitting in which is facing out instead of facing the wall then she placed my cloth napkin over my lap our server came over and asked for our drinks they actually brought us out some complimentary champaign cordon negro to be exact he also explained how this whole process works basically there s this circle shaped card which is very important if you wanna eat the good stuff it s green on one side and red on the other red means you don t want to be served and green means bring it on this is for the men with swords of different types of meat walking from table to table but before i do speak of the main course our server pointed us to the salad bar this is no ordinary salad bar for the lack of words it was huge what amazed me most was that they actually had different types of cheeses and a small selection of sea food such as zesty shrimp and smoked salmon everything from there tasted just as good as the main course so not even half way into finishing our salads we decided to flip the card to green and these men with swords did not waste a second and came rushing over at almost every corner of the table there was filet mignon skirt steak lamb chops flank steak brazilian sausage parmesan chicken which was kinda dry and i think they should just stick to steak and my favorite of the night the garlic picanha our server brought out some mashed potatoes and these sweet bananas to cleanse our palates and i didn t even need my a1 sauce and amazingly we had room for a little taste of dessert after i mean it was our anniversary and you gotta end it right with dessert our server brought over a sample tray of all their desserts we decided on the brazilian cheesecake i don t know what makes it brazilian but it was pretty delicious if you re not really picky with steak but would love to explore the different cuts this place is a good start
  outdated decor slow and unfriendly service paid 130 for 2 people no cocktails for chinese food that was equivalent to a average chinese buffet save yourself the money and frustration and eat at beijing no 9
  what can i say other than wow we so enjoy our dining experience at tommy v s urban kitchen that we chose to introduce our friends to this fabulous restaurant this past saturday night as we entered we were given a warm reception from zoran the owner main person who greets you entering who then escorted us to the bar for a wonderful bottle of champagne from there we moved to the dining area to a nice quite table for 4 our entire dining experience was fabulous starting with the caprese appetizer right into our entrees of salads and pasta the service food and ambiance speak volumes i can honesty say their are very few places in scottsdale that deliver the whole package like tommy v s urban kitchen i recommend this location to any one looking for a great place for dinner entertaining client or a great place to hang with friends you will not be disappointed
  one cool thing about this place is that they brand a u on your burger but other than that its mediocore
  the food is amazing really good chinese and service the spicy shrimp and noodles are great so is the duck
  rao s has the best meatballs i order this as an app and i pretend i m at the original in ny this restaurant has such good energy with the christmas decorations pics and happy employees
  they have hoegaarden on tap aside from the amazing beer selection everyone is super friendly and the atmosphere is amazing don t forget about the boots if your party drinks 3 you get a free come back in t shirt the late night menu is superb as well burgers fries or other snacks for only 3
  i tried the oyster shooter their fried calamari wow sooo good
  they have a really great happy hour i hate that it s only 4 6 most places are 3 7 but the food is very good and the drinks are cheap i ll definitely come back
  i have been eating here for 15 years and the food is better and better every time i was so lucky the restaurant opened up after hours to host my rehearsal dinner for my wedding they customized menus and even had gluten free selections for me we really wanted breakfast under the stars and the whole crew made that possible the food was amazing the service was impeccable the care and concern everyone put forth will be treasured we were so pleased with everything that we returned to the us egg on wednesday for breakfast tempe location no matter what location you are at you will have a great meal service and experience i highly recommend us egg you can t go wrong with the protein cakes skillets and more thanks gebran for amazing me we are so fortunate you agreed to do so much for us may your kindness be returned 10 fold
  a whole lotta oysters and yes they are good
  got a burger with green and white mild on the bun took 2 bites before i realized it also the soda machine was disgusting never eating there again the new mcdonald s out in the parking lot is much better
  kind of hidden in a non descript shopping strip this mom pop place is a great find i ve only tried their meats beef lamb and chicken lamb is the best the choices are kind of limited seems like half the menu are kebabs but they are so tasty if the prices look a bit high the portions that come out justify that the grilled meats rest on a huge plate of flavored rice i can usually save half for lunch the next day some of their desserts look tempting but i never have room for them maybe i will order some to take out next time
  hands down the best flour tortillas i have ever had i had a carne asada burrito and i couldn t tell you what the meat tasted like because all i can remember is that tortilla it was soft thick and flavorful it definitely made the burrito
  they are nice fast and i didn t get sick i gave them the stars i gave them for that the sushi is sub par now even though years ago this place was awesome i look at the good reviews and they talk about how easy it is to get a table hello don t you wonder why they aren t busy the good news is that if you think this is good sushi someday you re going to try good sushi and be like wow
  ordered the oxtail stew and it was the best i ve had in az very flavorful plenty of juice and super delicious i did order potato salad on the side but got cabbage instead it was pretty good staff wasn t very friendly but not rude at all just felt rushed
  to me a place like this makes me a true yelp follower had an inkling for a burger at lunch today being new to the area i was looking for an in and out burger fortunately i did not find one immediately near buy what i did find was that yelp and yelpers were telling me to i had to check out this place yes it was off my route by 1 1 2 miles but if a burger shop can get 4 1 2 stars it must be worth the effort i found about 10 parking spaces in the rear no street parking as indian school rd is a busy one i entered the fully customized and highly decorated shop that can t be more than 20 feet across the outside front patio porch had counter space for 8 10 people no tables counters the interior had space for another 8 10 people with only 1 or 2 tables to speak of the other spots were also counters with stools the menu is short but to me that means they focus on what is important you come for a burger you will get a burger no distracting other extras though they do offer wings which i will try one day i was greeted by a guy who absolutely knows something about customer service he greeted me as soon as i came in handed me a menu asked if i had questions and offered to help he shared that they had a 5 special of bacon cheeseburger fries and a canned drink i took him up on it he asked me what kind of cheese at least 4 choices there or to go and my name he had me take a seat and he brought my burger and fries to my counter spot outside he offered a few times a ranch dressing i declined until i figured out it must be something special he shared that they make their own buttermilk ranch dressing for the fries i took him up on his offer it was a fine addition to the fries previously salted with seasoned salt the burger was good it is a simple 1 3 lb i did not notice a grilled taste but he lettuce and tomato were fresh the grilled onions were a plus i had a great burger and fries 1 star i had great customer service 1 star i had a great value meal 1 star i had a great visit to a quaint interesting business 1 star my only reservations are these the hours are only 10 am 4 20 pm what am i going to do for dinner or late evening snacks tight eating quarters i was there at 11 20 and it was already filling up what would i do on a friday at 12 15 small parking lot shared by other stores next time i try the mushroom burger and the time after that i will try the fat burger two patties
  went tonight with the family for dinner service is below average and has been for years the part that really got me was that i ordered fajitas with no sour cream my wife asks for a side of sour cream they charge us for the side my son and i ask for more tortillas as they give you only 2 the waiter takes 5 min to bring out the wrong thing then another 5 before he brings the right tortillas food cold at this point they then proceed to charge for extra tortillas don t nickel and dime your customers especially when you screw up great president bush ate there we get it he also ate at a million other places get your act together
  love the old school charm of the place had a corn bread pancake a serve of griddle and the reuben omelette the omelette comes highly recommended and it does live up to its reputation friendly service and homely atmosphere it s cash only though
  i have been wanting to try this place since it opened i ve heard some good reviews from friends and seen on yelp i also heard this place is run by former nobu chef i have some friends in town and decided to try this place last night we had a large group of people there was 18 of us we made the reservation prior since it was for so many of us when we got there the table has not been set up yet we waited for them to arrange our table after we sat down it took our server four times back and forth to get our drink order right he kept forgetting what we ordered and we only ordered either hot tea ice tea or water i really didn t think it was that difficult then we ordered by section for the food and asked to split the check by section some sections got appetizers and their main entrees while some other didn t even get their appetizers yet they forgot quite a few things that we ordered and we had to keep asking the sever wasn t apologetic at all when we asked our missing orders after we got our check it wasn t the way we asked to split either overall services was 2 out of 5 for me and it ruined everyone s experiences most of my friends said they would not go back i feel kind of embarrassed by recommending this place for us to try food 1 salmon tacos 3 5 5 it was average nothing really special about it 2 rock shrimp with yuzu sauce 3 5 5 it was average too nothing great about this either kinda like honey walnut shrimp but not as good 3 catalina island uni 4 5 5 i love uni from catalina island they have pretty fresh ones here 4 chilean sea bass 3 5 5 the cilantro dressing was not flavorful enough for me sea bass was fresh 5 truffle bone marrow 4 5 it was pretty good except it was bit salty for my taste and i couldn t use any of the seasoning that came with cuz it was bit salty already 6 japaneiro fried rice 4 5 it was pretty good combination fried rice all in all i would not recommend to come here with big groups i like the food but i was not in love with the stuff i ve tried i may come again in the future and try other stuff on the menu when they have a system in place and with a smaller group
  decided to come and give them another try no food on buffet service almost suck but to top it all off they the workers were changing a baby s shirt dipper on one of the back tables nasty last visit ever
  slow service that forgot ordered items food is average at best and pricey you can get a larger size and better tasting short ribs at ono hawaiian for 7 bucks less
  what a gem of a find i m from la and came for thanksgiving to see my family and chef sarah has made it possible for me to eat amazing raw food my entire trip chef sarah sits down at the table and carefully explains everything on the menu at this quaint little wood cottage restaurant i ve eaten here for 3 days and loved everything they even have a greenhouse in the back where they grow sprouts and wheatgrass thanks so much for helping me have the perfect holiday chef sarah
  it was the best smoked meat ever
  my second time was even better than the first this time i got the chicken and waffles omg it was glorious love love this place
  my wife and i love the nachos they are not your typical nacho plate great appetizer for 2 3 people
  took a half hour to get my first drink and an hour to get my 2nd drink the waitress was no where to be found and when she did finally appear i had to ask her where my drink was she forgot it food was okay
  this review is for their lunch one of the best values hidden in old town scottsdale i had their sashimi plater for 8 you got 9 pieces of fresh sashimi rice and salad i have also tried their kautsu lunch and that is a steal as well
  this place has ruined me for any other pizza it was amazing will stop everytime i m in vegas
  i can say that the sushi is actually pleasant the atmosphere is quaint not over the top but cute my wife and i ordered 5 sushi rolls california spicy tuna spicy crab and salmon tempura i didn t care for spicy crab because they mix the crab meat with mayo but my wife likes it that way cali and tuna rolls were good my fav was the salmon tempura rolls that was awesome they fry the salmon in tempura batter and then roll it really good for an appetizer we got soft shell crab it was a pretty large size crab and is enough for two people as an appetizer however the batter used wasn t your typical tempura it was a thicker kind of batter like the kind used on fried shrimp tempura is much lighter and fluffier while this batter was hard and extra crispy i didn t care for the batter at all but the crab itself was very meaty not sure where they get their soft shell crabs but they were pretty meaty for our entree we got the teriyaki beef bowl with rice and vegetables that was good i asked for the teriyaki sauce on the side because you just never know what a restaurant will do with that sauce they may end up using too much to where it becomes over powering so having it on the side was a smart choice it was very good vegetables were crispy and rice was well cooked and fluffy the service was very good very kind girls working there we were there on a thursday night st paddy s day 2011 and it wasn t that busy the sushi was brought out within 3 4 minutes way before the appetizer however in all fairness i should have known better no matter where you go if you do not request the appetizers brought out before the sushi then your sushi will often arrive beforehand this is because sushi is made very quickly whereas appetizers take some time especially soft shell crab because it needs to be fried i had a good laugh when the sushi came out first and our waitress said she could take it back and wait until the appetizers were done but my wife said no it was funny though no big deal prices are normal and in some cases good compared to other places their 50 off menu contains most of the normal sushi rolls most people likely order california spicy tuna etc if you just like sushi rolls then seriously do not order anything else most of the rolls come in 8 pieces averaging 4 per roll most women can probably tuck away 2 3 rolls while men can put away 4 5 rolls so for women you ll spend between 8 12 while men will spend between 16 20 you can also call ahead and pick it up these prices are as i said normal but can also be considered cheap as compared to some of the more higher end sushi places total we spent 45 00 which isn t bad at all considering there were two of us we got sushi rolls an entree plus appetizer and we got full the food is good give it a try it makes a great place to eat at before heading over to aliante casino to see a movie not to mention their prices are about the same as getting popcorn candy and soda at the movies how scary is that so skip the popcorn and get sushi instead it s better for you anyway and lord knows our country needs to lose weight final note the reviewer before me commented on the take out order being more important to the restaurant than the customers nearly 95 of the restaurants out there do the same thing i worked in the restaurant industry for a long time at many different places and we always catered to take out orders first that had large tickets that s just the way it is get used to it a 600 order is always going to take precedence it may be wrong to do but that s often what happens i feel bad for those people because they re right it s not fair but at the same time it could have happened to them at any restaurant because this kind of thing does happen at many restaurants all the time
  first off this place was good now there is a new owner chef and it is even better curries and soups and are amazing the best and most flavorful better than lotus for the usual suspects place is the best in town for regular thai food as in you won t find anything here you never heard of biggest complaint no more stuffed chicken wing and why is there no crispy rice salad anyways i eat here at least one time a week
  perfect breakfast impeccable service my wife and i stopped in for breakfast today for our first visit she ordered the granola raspberry pancake and i had a create your own omelette both were totally awesome cooked to perfection the waitresses were very friendly and walked us through all their specials and answered all our questions my omelette was light and fluffy like i prefer them and the cheese was melted to perfection my wife s pancake was an absolute taste sensation the restraunt was very clean well decorated and we got our food right away even though they were extremely busy i found the owner at the counter and advised her how impressed and pleased we were with our breakfast selections and told her to pass on our sincere appreciation to the chef and that we would definitely be back to sample the rest of their menu can t wait to try their lunch menu
  food was decent service was terrible the food was alright nothing too special i have had pizza and salad and appetizers from here nothing has been mind blowing where i have a problem was our server she was terrible she gave attitude when i ordered a water only i had my kid with me this means i will tip you extra because kids are a hassle she got 8 for a tip she took 22 minutes from the time she gave us menus to the time she got our order 22 minutes i asked if they put raw egg in the caesar dressing she said well of course they put raw egg in it it isn t well of course i asked because it wasn t obvious i then ordered an appetizer for my meal because i didn t want to wait another 20 minutes for her to return my meal was fine everyone else s meal was fine the server asked me if i wanted to try a different drink besides water when i m more than halfway through my meal probably not she was rude and hopefully i don t get her again yes i do remember her name but i don t want to put it on here my meal was 11 plus tax so i gave her a dollar normally i would have given her at least 3 50 since my kid was there but she didnt deserve the dollar i gave her
  today was my very first visit on friday after thanksgiving at 11 40am the place was full like a weekend i thought the hagow and shrimp and scallop dumplings had very thick skins so i discarded them and just ate the fillings there were no sui mai for an hour and just the same 2 carts going around and around the sui mai were okay but lacked shrimp and tasted a bit bland finally some ham shui gok s fried footballs stuffed with meat came along with some sesame balls we ordered the fried footballs and they were stone cold i told the cart lady and she just shrugged her shoulders like saying what could she do finally some panfried turnip cake came around and it was also cold the trays of baked goodies came around often and they all looked very good but we are more fans of the savory rather than sweet so we felt that the variety was lacking in that department we never saw any bean curd meat rolls or stuffed peppers in black bean sauce either i would give this place another try but right now i feel the china king had better tasting dim sum plus you can order the fried footballs and turnip cake off the menu and know it will be hot upon arrival the service staff were also rushing around past our table and that was a bit distracting maybe they were not expecting such a large crowd for a friday
  beautiful interior high quality dishes and great service definitely a place to take your girlfriend if you want to wow her dont forget to enjoy the amazing view of the strip
  while its not lotus it was tasty an the women were nice the cook was singing so i m sure food was made with love
  popped into what used to be blunt a couple of weeks ago for a cuppa and a bite to eat in the evening service was considerate swift and pot of tea for two was a very good size the potato wedges were well cooked and served with more than one dip so that was a pleasant touch the tuna salad was well presented and filling so all in all a decent dining experience that didn t cost the earth
  pcg is an excellent place to relax for brunch you will find courteous staff excellent table service and good food the environment was very laid back and relaxing definitely worth checking out if your in the area
  by far my new favorite restaraunt heard tons about it so finally my gf and i tried it about a month ago and we have been back 2 more times since then we get a bottle of champagne 2 orders of the steak frites and 2 sides dishes macaroni and spinach and for about 100 bucks not bad at all for the quality of what you get highly recommend
  best pizza in c u the thick it s not chicago style pan is amazing and unlike anything i ve ever had anywhere else i ve been going there 30 years and it s always been great get it to go service is slowwwww
  i see you darren w i get your point but i think you have missed the point of brookline pub this review is going to break it down for you things you go to brookline pub for cheap beer free pool on sundays 30 cent wings on monday and thursday karaoke on thursday nights a smoke filled room of blue collar dudes things you don t go to brookline pub for a good meal anything cooked to perfection a check that actually reflects what you consumed good smelling clothes after leaving a door on the bathroom a door on the bathroom stall i love the brookline pub for what it is a smokey bar filled with people who want to drink and hang out the bar tenders are nice missy is my girl their craft brews are under 4 and they have cheap bar food yeah it s not that great but it s brookline and it s a dirty pub that i happen to love
  yummy i had the basil rolls and cashew chicken medium and both were very delicious the vegetables were very fresh and the sauce was very tasty but not heavy i left feeling full but not too full the service was also fantastic and attentive i moved a block away and will definitely be back soon i would have given it 5 stars but didn t think the menu was as extensive as i would have liked
  they have the best crispy tofu large pieces cooked perfectly delicious vegetable soup and perfect udon noodles staff very friendly and helpful small but accommodating dining area
  we were in vegas for the weekend for my friend s wedding our last night there we were looking for a great seafood place to eat at i found seablue through google sorry yelp and this place was fantastic we ordered fresh oysters seafood paella strip steak with a 1 2 lobster and 2 glasses of prosecco i think the bill came out to 220 ish service was stellar the food was amazing i will definitly check out michael mina s other restaurants
  ordered a large pizza 12 wings and cannoli on monday with the coupon featured on yelp 25 off the food was very good and what a bargain the pizza had great flavor plenty of cheese and savory toppings i live a block away so i will definitely be back soon to try more items
  i took my kids there today for first time and my daughter s grilled cheese sendwich had mold i even took a picture no matter how tasty restaurant is it can t get forgiveness if they serve spoiled food by the way it is 105 outside and their kitchen door to outside is open
  my wife and i ate here this evening for our 15th anniversary the interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations the menu had also changed with some items doubling in price a coworker of my wife had given her a 25 gift card for christmas we ordered sweet teas and a bloomin onion the onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning my wife had the chicken tenders and i had the pork tenderloin it wa a good but wasn t outstanding at one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table he didn t introduce himself he asked about our meal and disappeared i told the waiter about him we were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the french toast bread pudding looked delicious
  lineup always moves very fast if there is one amazing food huge portions good prices the coffee is good the eggs are always amazing unlike a lot of places and the service is incredible once you are seated your coffee mug will not go dry
  i have never been treated so rudely and unprofessionally i changed my drink order twice and you would have thought i killed some one alexis the server told me after i told her that i didn t want the iced matcha green tea that the item would not be removed from my bill i told her the drink tasted horrible like matcha mix and tap water and i did not want to drink it because it did not taste good she was extremely rude and i asked to talk to a manager as a former food server i know that removing an item from the bill is no biggie i saw the manager coming over to our table and i thought the problem would be rectified the manager was rude and confrontational instead of fixing the problem he actually made things worse but eventually decided to take the 4 00 item off of our bill the excitement my husband son and i initially felt walking into the place subsided after all of this hoopla over a drink we felt unwanted negative vibes the entire time we were there despite all of this we decided to stay like dummies and try the food while we were eating alexis threw the check on the table she did not bother to ask us what we thought about the food or whether or not we wanted refills on drinks or dessert i know as a server you never bring the bill over until you see that your patrons are done eating she obviously did not get this memo i seriously would not recommend this establishment and not because the food isn t good a place of business should treat anyone who walks through the doors like family the service provided by the server alexis and the douche manager was absolutely horrendous i will not be returning and i will tell everyone i know not to go also service sucks
  awesome southern comfort food done with impeccable style and service i visited with my 3 sisters and we all could not believe how good everything was the brined fried chicken with watermelon and waffle came with maple syrup and a hot red sauce just the right blend of sweet and savory grilled romaine crispy and charred and perfect florida heirloom tomatoes with citrus vinaigrette perfect desserts were a giant piece of bourbon layer cake with cream cheese bacon frosting and chocolate chess pie it was worth the food coma
  what a surprise i have driven by capo s over a thousand times and finally on a whim decided to try it out the ambiance and food were out of this world we sat off the main dining room but still could enjoy the action in the other room service was fantastic and the food the best the meatballs were huge and melted in my mouth the garlic salad dressing was perfect not too much garlic but enough to fend off those vampires that might be lurking in vegas at night we will be back
  oh my goodness the pilgrim is the best savory thing i have ever eaten in a pastry crust it was thanksgiving perfectly executed and tucked into a flakey not at all soggy pillow of heaven served with gravy and cranberry sauce if youre doing it right you slather both all over your pastry to get a bit in every bite i want to try every pasty and cant wait to go back
  friendly staff good beer and a great chicken sandwich laid back atmosphere awesome trivia on saturdays
  quick update they no longer serve the mac cheese its a terrible tragedy
  pizza was really good super thin and greasy but i feel it was a bit overpriced out the door 2 toppings was 16 change for a medium probably won t go back
  first night in vegas after a very long flight not really the flight but the delays in san jose i arrived in las vegas about 90 minutes later than i had expected i had already made reservations at nine fine irishmen but i had to constantly push it back due to the delays finally got to the hotel and just threw my bags on the floor didn t even change or wash up or anything because i was absolutely famished my girlfriend and i walked over to ny ny and were greeted by one of the hosts there and asked us if we wanted to sit downstairs or upstairs i asked which is louder and he offered to take us in and we could have our pick which was great we decided to sit up stairs overlooking the stage where a band was playing a lot of irish fare the decor and the audacity of the place is awesome it s like ireland threw up from across the pond and it all landed in this restaurant i loved it from the minute we walked in now on to dinner we started dinner off with the drunken onion rings now i ve had my fair share of onion rings in the past and i would have to say that these fat behemoths take the cake hands down they were huge but they were cooked to perfection the batter was amazing and the onions on the inside were cooked perfectly now onto the entrees for the evening my girlfriend decided on the pan roasted red snapper which looked out of sight and i m sure was very tasty since there wasn t any left for me to even try haha and i had the pork porterhouse which when it came out i was actually in shock it was huge and it tasted incredible especially with the apple and peach chutney side dishes which i wish would have come with the meal instead of having to dish out another 5 each were great never the less i ordered the colcannon mashed potatoes which we both enjoyed immensely and my girlfriend ordered the whipped sweet potatoes which were awesome too all in all i d have to say that this restaurant will most definitely be visited again the next time we are in vegas
  second time i ve eaten here made reservations for 6 people and we showed with only three and they said no problem after they sat us 2 of our missing 3 showed up and the staff immediately got a second table pulled over and seated the other i thought was awesome we all placed our orders and 4 out the five of us got the bone in ribeye and we all said it was one of the best steaks we have had ever sides where all very good also grits smashed potatoes baked potato was huge the staff was great and was a very well oiled machine dominic was our head waiter and he was great we will back this summer for another stop
  huge their pizza is so huge it won t even fit in the biggest box they have a lot of the time this is a problem making up for awful tasting pizza not the case here fantastic i ve had pizza from here a few times as my sister lives relatively close and when i go visit i try to talk them in to pizza from here it s an interesting place and very authentic the prices are very reasonable i ve not tried anything but pizza but i freaking love pizza and i love their pizza here note i always just get cheese pizza because the kids like it more but it s great
  great prices and great food here i love it every time and open 24 hours
  no doubt best sushi in town jackie rocks
  i recommended this place to our friends and i was so embarrassed 2 of us in our party ordered prime rib medium rare one of us had an end cut and when we mentioned it we were told it would be another hour before more prime rib would be ready all of our dinners were stone cold and the manager said he could take it all back and fix it from where i was sitting i could see the kitchen and all of our plates were headed for the microwave oven we motioned for our server and told him we did not want out steaks and lobster tails heated in the microwave he apologized we left and we will never ever go here again the manager was totally unprofessional and clueless in solving this situation
  no
  great place to stop in for lunch we had miso soup complementary edamame free from the check in in offer the lunch special with cali and crunch roll 10 we left stuffed for 11 bucks well plus a tip so more than 11 but hey that is awesome the miso soup is very good the edamame is salted right and cooked right and the cali and crunch rolls are very very good our waiter was good too small complaint seems like the place needs a little detailing the vents are dusty tables sticky walls smudged clean overall but needs a little tune up
  i m am being overly critical in my review of bentley s on 27th and were it not for how the evening ended i would be giving them a solid 4 star rating however let me not get ahead of myself firstly the view it s beautiful and it s clearly a major reason for choosing this restaurant so the setting and ambience do not disappoint starters were superb blackened tiger prawns and luxury mac n cheese main course was good dover soul and the seafood speciality although the latter was overly rich and could have been a little more balanced the cheesecake dessert was however a letdown and it took forever to make its way to our table suffice to say that the best thing on the plate was the fresh fruit bentley s on 27 is knocking on the door of 4 stars but just missed the mark
  food is good and well presented service is professional and quick
  i m in a bowling league at arsenal lanes and my team was meeting here every week for happy hour before we roll we tried to dine here three different times and every time our bills were messed up food was forgotten and took forever and when we were finally fed it was cold or bland they have really nice specials but i would have rather paid full price to have things done right the bar tenders were forgetful and not attentive at all and they weren t even busy i really want to like industry but it just hasn t proven itself to me i ll probably give it another shot at some point but it s not going to be any time soon for now we ve taken our pre bowling business to new amsterdam and have been quite happy
  excellent authentic chicago stuffed pizza i used to have it shipped to me from gino s east in chicago but now i eat here we love this pizza
  i eat at pei wei frequently and have always been happy until tonight i ordered the low mein and it was awful unfortunately i got it to go so i was stuck eating something that was not good at all so disappointed may be a while before i venture back
  great place enjoyed the food drinks music and ambiance
  after researching numerous articles on the best burgers in phoenix it was noticed that delux burger was on every one of those lists i myself have been dying to try it for some time now and my bf happened to be having a burger craving last night after some convincing we went to delux and for a small place was so happy to be seated right away because it was 8pm and we were hungry the ambiance of the place is bar and lounge which to me was nice especially for a friday night however my bf wasn t initially pleased because of the dim lighting and the fact that he wouldn t be able to see his food let s just say that didn t matter anymore because his first words after his first bite of the delux burger was burger craving fulfilled and after trying it myself i was impressed definitely one of the best burgers i ve tried i got the veggie burger which was good but i wish i had ordered the delux burger as well we also got an order of mixed fries regular sweet potato a la carte literally in a super cute tiny shopping cart and was very pleased my bf who also was not a sweet potato fan just became one because theirs were that good and the aioli sauce it came with helped a ton our server was more than attentive and we even got a visit and chat from who i believe was the owner which was very nice we were curious to try the sushi that they recently started serving there which the owner explained stems from his other restaurant zen 32 but we will save that for next time because we will definitely be back
  i had the bbq cheddar burger and it was amazing i asked for extra bbq sauce and they brought out warn bbq sauce shoutout to our server hiromi she was amazing
  this place is disgusting they allow drunk people on their porch to harass customers but then if the customer complains they are cut off sorry but that is messed up i ll go get crappy bar food from places that at least support females not be harassed if you re a girl wearing a dress don t go here because people are allowed to say rude and inappropriate things to you worst place ever
  lo lo s tickles me pink i love everything about the place the atmosphere and theme is awesome and unapologetic about it for fuck s sake there s an old fashioned looking sign that says kool aid always on tap it s amazing service was slower than i d hoped and i never did get my beer but everyone was very nice the food was good and worth the price it felt like home cooking it was hand food and i liked that next time i go i plan on coming in there with room to eat a lot because it was tops
  the location is quick and friendly but let s face it it s taco bell
  a buddy and i were out for a wild night on the town now that i m a mom any time i m out past 8pm constitutes a wild night and ended up here for a pre drinks dinner it seems to be the only moderately priced restaurant in red rock one that isn t fast food but isn t 30 for entrees i had the sampler plate of sliders and a plate of onion rings buddy had the smokehouse burger and fries ok so i know sliders are supposed to be small but these sliders were miniscule i could finish one in about two medium sized bites seriously if i really tried i could ve maybe fit an entire one in my mouth and no matter what others may say my mouth is not that big p so i had to pace myself and take tiny bites because i didn t want to be done before my friend was even a quarter of the way through her burger taste sampler plate of sliders c beef best of the three a good combination of patty sauce and grilled onion turkey normally i love turkey burgers this one was just meh the meat was overcooked and too dry so it was hard to taste anything else ahi tuna interesting to taste it in a burger form the big bun outweighed delicate tuna could barely taste the tuna onion rings b perfectly crisp just a tiny bit greasy portion was huge compared to the sliders smokehouse burger a friend loved it finished the entire thing might be the most i ve seen her eat ever fries b her burger came with fries which i had the pleasure of stealing good fries but not particularly memorable service c even though the restaurant was practically empty everything took a really long time our waiter seemed distracted and was not very attentive if i ever go back i ll order a proper burger and try the warm pretzel sticks who can resist pretzel dipped in cheese
  regular breakfast at 6 99 with card is fine excellent omelet cook some cool extras like miso soup chicken fried steak donut holes serves a hawaiian crowd since connected to the cal take the bridge and there is a lappert s ice cream shop everything on the buffet looks fresh even the sliced tomatoes only issue was weak coffee and slow on refills nice bright room too
  i enjoyed a local brew and fantastic fish ceviche followed by shrimp and chicken taco the food was fresh and well presented the bar staff was very friendly and engaging and gave me advice on the best bar to watch a football game the decor speaks hawaiian complemented by text mex flavours on the menu the outdoor dining area is large and open to the bar i liked it and would definitely go back
  i love coming to new cities and finding small hidden gems like the alo cafe super cute atmosphere surrounded by greenery it makes you feel like you re on the california coast most the seating is outside in the shade the staff was really friendly and the breakfast was delicious i ordered the corn beef hash with eggs not too spicy i m a wimp when it comes to spice and the perfect amount of food my friend had the omelette and loved it definitely add this to your breakfast list for the atmosphere alone it makes it a unique experience go for the food too
  tuesdays are the best obvs thanks to their special not really a dinner place but great place to hang out and have a variety of wine selections
  the best pretzel bread sticks ever soft with that salty crust delicious steak sliders too
  they ve got some bomb ass chile relleno here everytime i go in i tell myself ok let s try something new this time but always seem to end up with a steaming hot plate of chile relleno i don t know what they re doing different here but this one stands out the green chili is bomb too i d put that h t on my cheerios
  i must say that jean philippe patisserie has many dessert selection to choose from so many that i cannot decide which one i want from crepe to gelato to cakes to coffee ahhh i want them all i ended up treating myself to a caramel twist it has a strong coffee flavor which i like the caramel was there but it didn t overpower the coffee flavor nor was it too sweet thinking my cup of coffee would be enough i was wrong i just had to order a dessert i ended up getting the triple chocolate flourless cake it was okay waaayyy too sweet it for sure satisfied my sweet tooth i wished i had order their crepe cuz it looked really good yes it is expensive but sometimes u just need to treat yourself to something good after a long week of hard work
  my wife and i went to check full house bbq and we were not disappointed the place is very clean and well organized the service is very friendly we ordered surf and turf and kare kare never knowing what to expect to my surprise i ate it all that s how good it was the chef came out and introduced himself and found out he was a chef at mandalay bay hotel that explains the flavourful food and the excellent presentation of our food my wife had to order more to go and ordered the siopao and palabok excellent choice i was told that the boddle boat is good but it is serve for 4 people we will try it next time i need to try some more in the menu to give it a 5 but our overall experience is great with very reasonable price
  this is a great place to have a good cup of joe in the morning a lot of places around offer pretty much the same omelets sandwiches etc pancakes breakfast in a hurry and with poor service but finding a place with good coffee good food and attentive service all in one is not always easy this place has it we go very often and the place is nice and small but we always feel welcome their pancakes are delicious is not a fast food place so don t expect the waiters to be all over you they give you space and since the place is always packed try a sunday at 9am be prepared to have a nice no hurries breakfast
  there s no shortage of pricey delicious restaurants by big name chefs in the vegas so what makes bouchon so special your partners in dining are there on purpose it s not right off the strip like many of its restaurant peers at those places you could be dining near people who are a fan of the food people who just happen to walk by or people carrying an oh so classy yard glass not bouchon you have to work to get to bouchon it s deep in the venetian but it s worth every wrong turn you might make on your way there if it s not horribly muggy sit outside by the garden pool the ambiance is a 10 also the service the best i ve ever had in the history of ever and do yourself a favor and don t bother getting the pommes frites sans truffles upgrade and you won t be disappointed
  yum great big group experience walked in not hungry and once the chef started chopping up the goodness right and front of me i ended up ordering great times thanks kyoto
  great late night food sandwiches and fries are on point i would like to think that this is the best spot in pittsburg unhealthy eating
  great place good pizza that tastes great and is very authentic we had a mushroom and sausage and we were very impressed you won t be disappointed
  this is probably one of the better buffets vegas has to offer we went for brunch and beat the long lines the choices are much more exotic such as the eggs benedict gnocci duck legs etc they have a good salad bar yogurt and granola breads and spread etc the dessert section had ice cream little cakes panna cotta a lovely passion fruit cake croissanta donuts chocolate covered strawberries and more while buffets aren t the highest quality of food wicked spoon does a good job of keeping things fresh and interesting
  i have been here many times and love the food unfortunately last time i went to sit down and eat they totally ignored my daughter and i they looked at me several times and my daughter several times but nobody ever came to help us they helped other tables and even went to folding pizza boxes i m amazed that that even happened since that incident i have not gone back maybe i will eventually
  not bad huge portions so plenty to share for a chain restaurant i was pretty impressed i would recommend going here if you are in vegas as most of the restaurants are pretty iffy when it comes to quality
  definitely not worth going to unless you have the groupon or some sort of crazy deal i used the 75 groupon that covered a starter 2 salads soups 2 entrees a side to share and 2 desserts asked for a medium cooked filet mignon and very clearly was given rare seared mediocre steak and quality would not go again and that showed seating for at least 250 and there was about 15 people on a saturday at 7pm
  this is probably the best ny style pizza i ve had outside of the east coast my boyfriend s family of 10 came over and the only sensible option for a party that large is pizza and this place is right down the street we ordered it for delivery and it came promptly in 30 minutes like they said greasy cheesy and it had a fluffy crust highly recommended i will check out the actual restaurant next time i have a pizza craving
  i ditch class more than i should probably admit on this public forum and the last time i found myself walking away from my night class my best friend and i decided food was in order my best friend samantha b does not have a yelp she should in fact i would like to dedicate my current elite status to her because she knows every great restaurant all over the city i often accompany her to these food havens because i sugar momma her with rides to asu west samantha b introduced me to market bistro on the fateful day that we ditched night class and i have been craving it ever since we got a salad and mac and cheese the create your own is fabulous ten items for 7 99 parmesan chips grapes mixed springs corn walnuts olives and five other things i can t remember made up our salad which was big enough to split i questioned her judgment on the corn i really did i now see the error in my ways of the dressing choices we got ranch now i don t even like ranch but guess what you re going to like it and i did too on this salad anyways the mac wasn t as good as the salad but it was alright i wish it was fresh and came in larger portions next time i ditch class i know to go to market and get corn in my salad my cravings are telling me to ditch class soon
  my goodness greasy burn yo finger chicken these are the kinds of places i miss from la over there the food was proper and the hospitality is abundant it s been a long time but frankly my broken ass self can t add hypertension to the list of issues so it s a real treat to get some southern comfort i m with everyone that the cornbread pancakes are love i ve had these once as a cornbread pigs in a blanket in a southern mommas home these were better it s nothing crazy creative but it s simple goodness comfort at it s finest i had a white meat fried chicken plate with red beans and rice and collard greens the chicken was juicy and i think the seasoning was good slightly more salty than i normally like but i m not big on salt once i dipped in a side of gravy and hot sauce though it was all good muddy water to wash it down was perfect red beans and rice is basic and decent collard greens were decent bf got the chicken and waffles the waffles were interesting since they were shaped like a hot dog bun and the batter was a cinnamon batter we thought the waffle was good alone but that the sweet waffle got a bit too much after a while i prefer plain waffles with chicken i want to get these waffles for breakfast though we brought the bf s mom and grandma and they had a chicken plate and meatloaf both were very happy with it and it got the approval that they said there will be a next time the bf would like to say that he feels this is the best chicken he s had and that he wants the 5 star bump both his mom and he would like to add that neither are fried chicken people but enjoyed it enough that they d both want the chicken again i m saying this is good solid fare but it s not the absolute best mississippi cooking i ve had but i d have to fly out to go get to my favorite food spot though i felt the food after but that isn t their fault my busted self indulged in fatty chicken and salts worth it though drinking plenty of water to flush it out 4 stars for the food with me the 5 star bump is definitely because of the staff we walked in and the owner greeted us enthusiastically our server was sweet and our service was attentive our server even offered to pull me up a to go muddy water since everyone was finished with foods but i was still thirsty and took just a gulp to finish it off when our plates came except the bf s the owner noticed and went up to the window to check up on the kitchen and promptly brought out his order gotta appreciate an owner who has a hand in the smooth operation and speaking of the line it s crazy how they kick it old school without any tickets and call out the order the kitchen doesn t mess up orders much either food never sits longer than a few seconds on the pass so food is hot and fresh for everyone sure it takes a while to get some foods but it was busy and everything is fried up fresh i d be worried if it didn t take a moment to make since everything should be fresh i think we re so used to fast foods that most people might think it s a long wait won t slap our mommas but we ll bring em back
  we went for valentines day and they were very busy and trying to make sure everyone was happy for a very busy night service was pretty good the food is what matters most and it was good too we had the buffet the best was the chicken tikki masala and lamb vindaloo in addition to the pakoras there was some other chicken dish that was good but i forget the name i hadn t heard of it before it was in more of a broth vs a creamy sauce there were some vegetarian options but not tons samosas and naan weren t the best i ve had but not bad i d like to go again
  went to little shanghai last night wednesday with a friend we were in no hurry had a lot of personal stories to catch up on so the slow service didn t bother us they were busy and i think there were only four people working dad in the kitchen mom taking orders and two boys who didn t speak much english delivering food and cleaning we shared some pot stickers that were excellent and a spicy sauce with fresh scallions tommy had the lemon chicken breaded boneless skinless breast in a tart and tangy lemon sauce i talked to mom and asked for suggestions and wound up with crispy noodles with three turned out to be shrimp beef and pork plus some lobster bits and pea pods broccoli oyster mushrooms water chestnuts bean sprouts carrots celery onions if i said mirepoix would that be snooty anyway the dish was delicious we spent a casual 2 hours with great food in a comfy place for twenty bucks apiece including wine and beers the food was fresh and properly prepared a good chinese restaurant catering to arcadia honkies
  third trip here and the nw pub burger is the best the staff has been great every time also a must try are the bacon cheddar potato pancakes nice atmosphere inside and out
  this place was awesome their food had alot of flavor and our waiter needed a little personality check overall would love to come back again for more
  bueno cheef gordon soy un admirador tuyo quizas porque soy emotional coach y la parte de coaching del programa me engancha sin dura la calidad de los productos es buena solamente buena que conste nada espectacular ni extraordinario eso si correcta con el precio el lugar me gusta aunque la particularidad de este casino son estos espacios tan especiales y su distribu ion en general si te estas preguntando si volvere sin duda si no obstante para impresionar tengo otros rtes mejores aprovado ahora ve come y cuentanos que tal te ha ido
  there isn t a bad thing to say about this place the place was packed and the wait was only 30 minutes which is great and the service was fantastic we shared the andy s sage fried chicken and still couldn t finish it the portions are huge and price is fantastic it s a must try i will be back
  very poor service waited 20 minutes for a juice not pleased at all lady taking my order was short and seemed annoyed
  my family goes out for breakfast every weekend we re always searching for the perfect spot unpretentious with a breakfast to rock your socks off when i saw the pictures on yelp with the homey decor and plates piled high with scrumptious looking breakfast staples i knew we d found a winner i was surprised there was no wait on a sunday morning we were seated and drink orders taken right away we all enjoyed our breakfast thoroughly portions were huge and prices very affordable we ordered the kids french toast for my son and the kitchen accidentally made the adult portion our waitress noticed right away and only charged us the kid s price for about 30 we had breakfast for three adults and one child with leftovers to boot and before i forget the breakfast potatoes were amazeballs i consider myself a connoisseur of breakfast potatoes and these were seriously the best i ve ever had crispy on the outside soft on the inside and seasoned perfectly awesome
  i went to china poblano with my family at 10 00 pm on a saturday night we were seated promptly our waiter was terrible he didn t explain the menu and was not helpful at all most of the plates can be shared but we didn t know how to go about ordering we all agreed that the experience could have been a lot better had we had a waiter who was helpful happy to explain the menu and had a personality if i would have caught his name i would have definitely called management the food was so so definitely not worth the prices
  we found this place on yelp it s a little tucked away and not on our normal route so we re lucky to have found this little gem the menu is great lots of options and some interesting dishes the food was outstanding as was the service we ll definitely be back
  i love the food here reasonable prices and they even deliver highly recommend this place humus is amazing here too
  since the change of ownership the food is only ok so it wasn t ever on my go to list for pho but after a long day and returning from a biz trip this is the closest pho joint to my home the owner i assume based on previous experience sat me down w a menu and there i sat sat sat and finally the owner goes out w a buddy to drink a beer and has to walk by me as i continued to sit first table by the entrance at the 10min mark i gave up and returned the menu to the bar area as i walked outside the owner was like are you done already obviously not you sat me 10 min ago so i found that question pretty condescending i told him i didn t receive any service after 10 min and to his credit he apologized so 2 stars for the ho hum food 1 star overall for poor service erasing knowledge of the existance of this restaurant fail original 10 28 2010 4 star i come here occasionally which means the food is tasty enough my personal consensus is the pricing is higher than what i d generally pay to get a no soup vermicelli fix their bowls are huge yum 20 this place is good for taking newbies the atmosphere and decor is modern and inviting and folks who are judgemental about divey looking joints
  this is the place for a great burger period although the bone marrow with caramelized onions and pork shoulder are pretty damn good too so with great service and wonderful ambiance i really liked this restaurant and look forward to returning
  their pancakes are so good they re practically a dessert themselves sometimes the service can get backed up when they re really busy but the staff is always very nice the outdoor seating is really nice during the cooler months and the booths are nice a long for big parties all around great breakfast place
  very friendly and especially affordable place great for students everything seems deep fried can t complain we re visiting today again
  as other reviewers have said this is a nice place to get a beer and chat with friends it s relatively quiet compared to other places and they do keep trivial pursuit cards around at the bar which can add a little fun into the mix if you re the trivia type i struggle a little bit with the gastropub classification on this one unless you call any bar grille establishment a gastropub i ve never had food here that i was particularly fond of nor would i consider it one of their selling points it s merely ok overall the map room serves a different clientele and provides a niche atmosphere unlike the other establishments in the square which is why is still exists
  all i can say is wow easily some of the best italian food i ve had you certainly get what you pay for the portions are no joke if you are in the mood for a classy delicious italian dinner this is the place to go
  this place has the best breakfast food and you don t have to wait if you call ahead to put your name in it isn t too expensive either
  this place is amazing wish they delivered prices are very reasonable and the food is fresh and delicious
  my wife and i love this place best lobster sandwich we ever had we ordered the connecticut and lobster was huge and very fresh we got the combo with lemonade and chowder fries which were also pretty good would definitely come back and try other flavours
  if you feel like korean food and you happen to be in the area then this place is just ok i had the stone pot bibimbob with the spicy tofu soup the bibimbob was ok but the portions of meat and vegetables was so small that i had to put in alot of sauce cuz there was so much rice it tasted so bland the poke was good and one thing i was curious about was meat chun never saw it before and would like the try it next time if i was ever in the area again this is the first korean place i went to that didn t have alcohol
  we worked on the 4th of july and weren t able to go to any celebrations came home and fell asleep until 9 30 pm and woke up hungry decided that we at least had to have bbq in honor of the day famous daves is nearby and we decided to try them out and see why they are so famous after trying their all american platter 50 we are still wondering
  stopped in for lunch and the open air high doors are great in the high 70 s temps of march
  i am very happy that i have found some decent non chain restaurants up in north scottsdale jj s is a great deli i ordered the tuna sandwich and got a side of cucumber salad my coworker got the dave s bagelwich my sandwich was delicious my only disappointment was the size of the side 3 bites and it was gone would probably be 2 for males coworker loved her bagel sandwich i do wish they had half sours but oh well i will be back for sure
  ok i ve been to someburro s a thousand times and i like it i really do however the problem that 990 out of those thousand times i ve had the pollo fundido simply one of the best fast guilty pleasures that you can experience however after eating it i feel like i ve just dug another inch closer to the grave or shaved another couple of days off of my life as i age i m trying to eat healthier so here i am at someburro s trying to find something healthy that doesn t give me visions of the grim reaper and that gives me the near orgasmic feeling that i have when down the pollo fundido so far i haven t found anything else on the menu that fits the bill i ve tried the veggie burro which is probably the healthiest thing on the menu and it s eh ok the avocado in it is great and i haven t seen them put less than fresh avocado slices in it i once tried the taco salad which was way less than satisfying and actually kind of gross i mean you take some actually healthy stuff and surround it in a bowl of fried whatever i m also not big into shredded beef or the machaca the chicken quality is ok but has a good portion of dark meat in it it s good because it s marinated so heavily though i d imagine that the marinade does not add to the health quotient on the bright side this place is decent for kids there are inexpensive options for little ones we get the quesadilla s for the boys who pretty much just pick over the quesadilla waiting for the go ahead from mom to dive into the churros by the way the churros are no bueno in my opinion the kids like em cause they are doused in sugar but they aren t doughy they are crunchy crispy and fried fried fried i feel pangs of guilt as if i m poisoning my children when they eat those some of you reading this are probably thinking if he s trying to be healthy perhaps he shouldn t be going to someburro s in the first place and you re probably right
  i still had 12 on my gift gard so i stopped by and grabbed a burger on the way home since this week i had already tried all the bbq it was a tough choice but i went for the devil s spit bacon burger no suprise it was one of the best burgers i have ever eaten cooked to perfection medium well with a nice layer of bbq sauce cooked into it topped with a toasted bun cheese crispy bacon lettuce tomato and crunchy hell fire pickles i don t think i took 1 breath until this thing was gone i can t wait to go back for another maybe they need a drive thru what is the best chain restaurant burger you ve ever had red robin vs tgi fridays vs famous dave s i m gonna check more thoroughly
  about the best thing i can say about the food at yard house at the red rock casino is that they have a very good beer menu if you like bar food the yard house has an extensive menu of offerings but everything we recently tried was less than mediocre there are much better bar food restaurants out there our party of four shared two appetizers fried calamari which was the worse fried calamari i ve ever had overcooked and with absolutely no seasoning it was bland dry and disgusting lobster crab and artichoke dip with chips and pita which had an unusual flavor not quite crab dip and not quite artichoke and lost somewhere in the middle pretty bad one taste was enough for me for entrees we tried steak sandwich which had a very tough and flavorless cut of beef in a bun filled with fried straw onions awful turkey pot pie which had an undercooked pastry crust and served in a dish that seemed as big as a wagon wheel way too much food although it was filled with tasty chunks of turkey and veggies not bad not good but edible crunchy ahi salad which had decent quality ahi that was seared quite nicely this was the best dish we received fish and chips which were greasy and sort of bland edible but not a lot going for it service was good and again the beer was great the waiter removed the calamari from the bill after i told him it was tasteless we won t be back except maybe for a beer
  24 7 pho can t beat it there s always a lot of people hanging around outside but i haven t had a wait in the few times i ve been the egg rolls are awesome and the only soup i ve gotten was the rare steak which is better than a lot i ve had loud as hell but always a good time
  the wine is good but a little pricier than i think it should be the bruschetta is absolutely out of this world recommending the ricotta salmon prosciutto and pepper in that order too i d had the same server each time and he s great remembered the table we sat at the wines we ordered and even the bruschetta i was shocked the only reason i didn t give this place a 5 was due to the limited parking and the painful wait
  thank you restaurant week i have been looking at this place for months on open table i will say i was overjoyed i didn t realize this is a high end steakhouse comparable in my humble opinion to donovan s and the ilk the nice part was i felt the vibe inside a bit more hip and modern the service was flawless and the food was wonderful steaks cooked perfectly and melted like butter if you get a chance to go here especially for something like restaurant week where you can save some money and really taste the menu i highly recommend the arrowhead grill
  had a lunch combo and a grab and how sushi combo wasn t good but the grab and go was much better not bad for a quick lunch
  had a great meal and enjoyed our dining experience our waiter alex was fun engaging and enthusiastic we loved it and we ll be back with friends
  we went to dinner here last night it was amazing we ordered the chicken tikka marsala with rice and nann bread would definitely recommend this place when you first walk in the place looks dead because it s in an old mall type thing but the seating is around the corner and there were lots of people there
  i love the innovative bar program and the broccili rabe crostini
  this restaurant is not southern i was expecting some gumbo or jumbalaya and got some sort of mesh of favors that were hit and miss it is not so much a restaurant as it is a chemistry experiment the dishes here that are good are interesting combinations of favors i haven t had before because this restaurant seems to me just an experiment to test people s tolerance for someone s best idea for a crazy chem lab you ll have to go to try for yourself it isn t southern anything it is lunar
  yes there is now a white castle located on the strip in las vegas everyone who wants to try them without going to the midwest east coast can now have a taste of the well known slider i have enjoyed white castle before in chicago and found that they are quite tasty and i can put a few back my cousin always orders them with extra pickles i should have remembered that when eating them in vegas i forgot that tidbit but they were still really good i really wish they had a location in denver that would make my year the best 2 things about the one on the strip they are open 24 hours and they sell beer what can make this place better well it is also attached to a casino the place was hoping and cranking out burgers at a rapid rate if you haven t tried white castle now is your time
  i do love fat heads definitely one of my favorite spots on east carson service is always fast and friendly what a beer selection too i always get the bumbleberry which is a blueberry and honey beer which comes with fresh blueberries in the pint i hate to put bad news first or last so i ll throw it in the middle their steak has really been missing the mark lately i ve ordered it a few times each time medium rare all but once it came out medium well to well done instead i cut them a little slack since steak isn t their specialty but any good chef should know the difference between a warm red center and a hot colorless center but when the steak has come out to temp it s delicious typically aside from the few times i gave their steak a shot i get the same few things i start with a giant plate of fresh cut garlic fries accompanied by chicken fingers with a side of bbq sauce the nachos are definitely to die for as well their sandwiches ahem headwiches are massive and really impressive too overall i give fat heads an a and highly recommend it
  went there around 8pm last saturday night we should have taken the hint it wasn t going to be very good given the fact the place was almost empty service was extremely slow my husband and i each ordered a margarita i got hibiscus he got an original after waiting forever for the drinks to arrive the waiter proceeds to tell us they did not have a bartender my drink was fine but my husbands had a foul taste to it he told a waitress and she stated that he shouldn t have ordered it if he didn t like it after asking to speak to a manager he then tells my husband it s his problem and maybe he just isn t in the mood for a margarita they never offered to remake the drink or anything just said it was my husband they were very rude we cancelled our food order we ended up paying for my margarita which was left sitting on the table should have been complimentary the only food we tried were the chips salsa the chips tasted old the salsa was overpowered with cilantro will never waste our time here again
  walked in saw 2 3 people in line when we arrived figured shouldn t be too long walked out of there 15 minutes later with now 8 people waiting did not want to go there to begin with but my coworker did because of being on a budget so i bit the bullet and reluctantly went 3 of the 5 people that came in after us left well before we did will not return to this one i d give negative stars if i could
  haven t been here for a while love this place has a great menu of rolls you don t see other places the staff is super friendly the manager actually engaged in conversation with us the sushi chefs make great food
  this is wynn s crown jewel fresh and often hard to find seafood are the star here this is an expensive restaurant and the prices are high but sometimes you need to splurge and this place won t disappoint some notes they begin with a seafood cart with the fresh fish of the evening we elected to share the john dory quite honestly it was good but not worth the hype i have had much tastier fish the pasta dishes were fantastic and the risotto was up there with some of the best i have ever had we had some langoustines hardly any meat a big tease skip these service was very good and this was a very enjoyable night steve wynn even walked by with his wife on the way to his table and said hello
  we love this place always greeted with a smile and welcome great little family run restaurant we usually go on tuesday night when they have a good selection of half price or discounted items they also have a sunday all you can eat special the quality is always as good as the hospitality
  greasy cold food with far less exceptional service avoid if you can the renovation looks great so there was a positive
  great happy hour til 7 every day i always get the red sangria the happy hour food is ok but we prefer to split the goat cheese burger because it is juicy and sooo flavorful service here has always been good especially while sitting at the bar they have a dog patio here as well we brought our dog here and they treated her to a huge bone and some water she loved it
  this is the best buffet in vegas hands down its the quality that makes this the premiere buffet in las vegas but you will surely pay for it the roughly 35 00 you spend may or may not be worth the price however vegas has become way overpriced and if you want to have a full stomach this is the place to go i recommend going for a late lunch its a bit cheaper and still a nice buffet everyone runs for the crab legs but the highlight of the buffet is the prime rib and the mashed potatoes definitely the best mashed potatoes i have ever had i give the wynn buffet a 86 100 it seems wynn has lowered their standards a bit not worth the breakfast buffet but lunch or dinner is a good choice
  so i was debating on writing a review or not to this place because it use to be my favorite place to hang out every thursday night for over a year with my boyfriend we had great service from matt darrin buddy justin ray and all the other guys who use to work there they went above and beyond to make sure they served everyone and the drinks and food were great things started changing mainly with the staff and the changes were not good all those guys we would return to see were no longer there the feel of the place was not the same and also the service with the new people was horrible i have not returned to this place in about 3 months because it just was not the same not just the service but the food there are changes and i do not like the new nachos those are not nachos anyways i read some of these reviews down there and it seems that the place is not improving and it makes me feel like that i have no business going back i just hope that the owners realize that their changes has affected business and it is really upsetting
  great food great staff great feel when in vegas you should check this out and hang with the some local
  stopped by native tonight for a drink and their new waitress working the patio was so incredibly rude she carded us for a drink which we understand but being regulars we didn t think to bring them but instead of being polite about it she was full of attitude it just rubbed us the wrong way then she came back and asked if we wanted to order anything we said no she huffed and puffed and went and got another waitress to help us the rest of the night the manager might want to rethink this hire and we are pretty sure the lemons they use for water and ice tea were sprayed with perfume
  tried this place for the first time today after reading the yelp reviews on burgers and i think it was even better than i had expected the california burger was awesome and i loved the fries to top it all off i had a dublin dr pepper to was it down was the best burger shop hamburger i have had in years the have a soda shop also where you can pick out gourmet sodas with a really big selection service was fast and very friendly i will definitely be back again when i am in the area
  wow we never knew this little gem of a place was just a few miles from home loved the authentic food choices the staff were friendly and the food was very good i had the elote loco and taco locos and we ordered guacamole to share everything was really good and we will definitely come and visit sabor again
  this is probably where you will find me most weekends if i m in the area the food is excellent well priced and the service friendly
  here is the problem with havana cafe its overpriced i ordered a emparedado cubano sandwich as carry out i liked it it was tasty and came with french fries and moros black beans and rice concoction it was supposed to come with cabbage salad but that appeared to be missing in action when i opened the box it cost me 16 if i pay that much for a sandwich french fries and rice blackbeans they need to be amongst the most delicious things i ve tasted in order to justify that but they weren t they were just barely good if they cut the price in half it would be a great meal worth the price until then i would avoid this place i wont be returning unless they do
  i wish i could give zero stars our waitress was nice service was horrible food was not worth the long wait
  best restaurant still open in this beautiful community excellent wine list and terrific food in a tuscan setting w a lovely patio on lake mead i like the italian dishes the salmon and steaks service could be better but overall this is a romantic getaway easy on your wallet
  food was ok but not something special i have tasted much better dishes
  great service great food loved the jerome burger perfectly cooked waitress was upbeat and got everything just right this was the perfect spot to eat in between stadium tours
  we were looking for something quick for dinner and realized there just aren t many chinese food restaurants in the area we d already tried our closest one and wanted to try something different then we remember wok in express on gibson went on a week night and the restaurant was empty nothing special looking but there are a lot of dine in tables which is surprising for your typical chinese food joint i placed my order while my husband was still mulling over what to get he orders a teriyaki bowl and the man shakes his head no for a second we were wondering what this meant no as in we can t order that finally he says i can t let you order japanese food at a chinese restaurant i have to have it on the menu but it s just not as good this was puzzling i mean why have something on the menu that you don t want to serve still my husband appreciated his honesty and opted for beef and broccoli instead the man threw in 2 veggie egg rolls and i got a free fountain soda for checking in the food was ready quickly and the portions were large we both enjoyed our meals and especially loved the chicken fried rice the prices were ok i liked that they marked the takeout boxes to let us know which was which we ll definitely return when we re in the mood for chinese takeout
  we usually pick up a to go order due to the cramped quarters you are literally sitting on top of the next table be prepared to a long wait if you order to go sushi preparers are more interested in pleasing the over indulging drinkers at the sushi bar while taking shots yes of liquor with them even saw the waitress join in the over indulgers are a constant scene i have witnessed on many occassions big turn off hey i like my happy hour drinks too but have some class
  the nightclub opens around 5 and is directly on top of and open with the restaurant it was so noisy i had to talk loudly for my fiance to hear me the satay of chilean sea bass was great the filet mignon was over cooked and dry the chinese sausage fried rice and buddhas feast were both good the service was sub par on our visit service was so slow we had to rush to make our show
  popped in last night for the first time a really impressed had the cod taco which was excellent and the chicken special which was pretty good too both the guacamole and salsa were fresh and we ll prepared only the chips were ordinary finally friendly helpful service made for a great evening
  i trust chris b on these types of things so his glowing review plus jason l s description of these sexy magical strands had me aching to try nudo we hit it up on january first i love you for being open right off the bat and were gleefully not disappointed the noodles are in fact pulled fresh before your eyes and are soft plump perfect and the broth on my beef flank noodle soup was swoon worthy lots of perfectly mouth watering beef crisp lovely veg and a quantity so pleasingly hearty i have noodle soup calling my name from the fridge as we speak my dinner dates were all delighted as well including the vegan who was able to swap the chicken broth for all veg though her soup could have had more veg in it actually load up our animal loving friends when you can restauranteurs they are hungry we tried 7 different salads each at about 1 50 a pop and they were all tasty the cucumber radish and potato salads were the table favourites all this good eating plus a beer and we walked out each paying under 20 including tax and tip super homerun win of a way to ring in 2013
  nice menu selection looked clean and well kept food was ok not very hot when served will go again though give them another chance
  this place is amazing to say the least i ve been looking for amazing thai food and thanks to some friends i found it we ordered about 7 different dishes and they were all delicious you will definitely find me here
  came down here from los angeles for the weekend and we decided to stop here for breakfast it was probably the best part out of all my trip the food was great and our waitress was the sweetest friendliest lady we came across i would definitely come back to vegas just for this place
  the crust makes the pizza crispy and friggin good well played secret pizza well played
  great service and friendly staff i had the tuna salad and the tuna was albacora fresh and the greens were the good kind and not just iceburg i would recomend this place
  solid spot on the lunch train and unless i m just a silly pants blind person the only location with what i like to call japanese fast food you know the kind of place where they just know everyone s going to pour the shrimp sauce all over everything so they give you a nice big plastic thing of it i did not partake in the hibachi menu had some sushi and a garden salad with that delicious sesame ginger dressing that really only tastes right from a place like this sushi isn t the best in the world but it s not grocery store quality either salad was fresh and crunchy and i like the challenge of eating salad with chopsticks a nice addition to the uptown lunch choices and since i m across the street it s just the right amount of walking in the sun from one place to the next all in all a solid spot gets a bid loud at the peak of lunchtime though bring a megaphone or be a loudmouth like me
  outstanding atmosphere food and drink you won t be disappointed
  a decision to go to woo che is almost always based off price not quality woo chee is probably the most affordable cheapest of the ayce kbbq offerings here in vegas at about 13 for ayce after 11pm this place is a great value but as many of fellow yelpers have noted this value does cost a diner in terms of quality i am not saying that the quality food here is bad but it could be alot better after 11pm they essentially stop replenishing the food in the buffet except for the meat and diners are free to get whatever is left when i got there are around midnight last week i noticed that all of the salad and much of banchan offerings were depleted the meat itself is not bad but really impressive either the spicy chicken is great and not offered at the other kbbq places and the jalapeno soy sauce is addition i wasn t too impressed with their cuts for the bulgogi and beef as it seemed like it was mostly fat on it the interior is like most kbbq places minimalistic but this place definitely has a cafeteria like feel to it woo che is a great value but there is a sacrifice on quality sura down the street offers a much larger variety of food in the same buffet style set up but is around 22 a pop
  decent place for quick chinese i don t like the fact that they don t serve the food in authentic chinese take out containers but hey its still ok i don t go there often but when i don t feel like going across town to my favorite place i pick this one in a quick pinch plus the owners are really nice
  cool after work hangout in north scottsdale incredibly crappy service disguised with nice legs in fishnet stockings beers are pricey except during happy hour their dry ribs are a must try ok i like it
  the service was spectacular and the food was too we did a travelzoo deal which i feared might result in less service but it was not the case at all we had a wonderful 3 course meal and added on the lobster too they had a special on wines over 100 so we took the plunge to compliment the meal with a french burgundy and it really stood up to the expertly cooked meal as well i m not typically a dessert person but the chocolate souffle was mouth melting heaven definitely coming back and hopefully getting my wines in there too i think it d be good company oh and the decor was beautiful elegant yet intimate too nice big private booth type seating oh la la i can t wait to return
  more food for your money than thai bail lemongrass or other thai places of that caliber i had 71 or 72 which should tell you how extensive their menu is which was beef with green beans and carrots i ordered 10 hot on a 10 point scale and it was hot but not unbearable like i said it s about the same as the others the service was so slow but the woman was nice and offered dessert because one of our members is a long time customer put it on your list if you haven t tried it
  o m g when it is 2am and you are starving this place is golden the cheese oozing burger was to die for the shakes were ahhhmazing it is so great to have a decent meal in vegas that will not cost you an arm and a leg and is good i would highly recommend this place head over towards nyny to find this amazing burger joint
  maybe i just ordered the wrong foods but really if you can t get a margherita pizza right i m afraid to order anything else i do not understand how this place got such great reviews i started with a white sangria no fruits and it tasted like a watered down limoncello this was followed by the beet salad everyone knows that you cannot toss soft cheeses such as brie or goat cheese in a salad it has to be added after the toss otherwise this happens where s the cheese why do the beets look like they have mold growing on them yes this happened for reals now about that pizza first it was watery and burnt that is a feat that seems impossible but it happened for reals the top was soggy and watery the crust was purposely overcooked but the charred flavor of the crust was overwhelming enough for me to put the slice down and start feeling like my stomach was developing cancer i will not come back and i refuse to recommend or bring anyone here
  hahaha almost a 5 star a j almost my girlfriend and i loved this place their pizzas are absolutely fabulous i had the bbq chicken and my girlfriend had the anton james chipotle and chicken hers was slightly under seasoned and mine tasted perfect the service was great the ambience is amazing and i love the views at night from upstairs my only complaint is if i were to pay for a 4 hot chocolate i expect real chocolate in my cup with 100 milk instead what i tasted was chocolate powder and hot water which was slightly disappointing at any rate this is your go to place for pizza in downtown simply wonderful
  went there for lunch had the main entre polish sampler excellent my boyfriend s dad is first generation polish and his mom is first generation german so i get a lot both polish german food in fact that is all we get at their house so it is hard to find a restaurant with authentic food the fresh kielbasa was great sauerkraut was savvory not sour which was excellent pierogies delicious and my favorite golabki stuffed cabbage was delicious only wish they had a tomato or mushroom sauce not just catchup well i m about to burst with all the good food i love that it is individually owned and operated by a polish couple service was excellent
  60 steaks a la carte that writing on a menu should make me believe this will be the best steak i had ever eaten for the winter season they had the taster menu starting at 110 so me and a few buddies split that while our big winner in the group got the grade 10 kobe filet mignon on here i see reviews state its the best steak they had ever had great i want to believe them but after eating i really question if they had been outside outback before this stuff is far from the best infact i had better 30 steaks while traveling through the dakotas mid west and even some areas outside nyc this is one of the rare instances where yelp is completely wrong with the review i will never go back because the meat is not worth the price simply put even the 200 steak was just a great steak ive had great steaks at 10 that price the sides were mediocre nothing spectacular yukon gold puree raw kobe tartar mushrooms truffles not cooked enough i can see im harping on the price of the products here but its hard to not let it affect my decision look at sherry t s review its very accurate
  great service and delicious mexican food everything is served with lots of cheese yummy love the sopapillas with honey too
  the linguine side for 7 blew me out of the water the simplicity and excellent taste were beyond any other food we had in vegas this place redefines fresh pizzas we had a spectacular lamb chorizo pizza
  just ordered take out from this place so this is just on the food alone and not on service the hubby and i ordered the beef jerky laab salad pork spicy basil chicken and pad kee mao beef the spice level on all were 6 except for the pad kee mao which was a 7 i have to say all in all we were very happy with the food especially with the laab we have had the larb at lotus of siam and chada thai and we prefer lucki thai s over both places please support this place i peeked in the kitchen and everything looked super clean did i mention they deliver too i was always a lotus snob after trying other thai spots and this has changed my mind the only thing i would say was negative is that it is right across the street from my house and i will now be frequenting this place way more than i should flavors are amazing balanced and complex just what thai cuisine is i even called them after my meal to tell them how good of a job they are doing
  there 6 lunch specials are fantastic service is always good waitresses are cute and the place has a good positive vibe i might give them 5 stars after i check out their happy hour or actually go there for dinner
  the plan was to come here for food and it had been highly recommended sadly i only made it for beers and i may have not reviewed it at all but i thought you yelpers deserve a warning first before the warning it s a cool looking modern bar comfy seats and a laid back atmosphere it does craft beers and has funky murals on the wall all sounds good eh it is actually a nice place for a beer or two the kicker in the story is the bill three bottles of ipa ordinary size bottles they cost 15 10 the barman might as well have had a mask and asked for our wallets so in sum nice place for a beer just be ready for the bill to be far higher than anywhere else on broughton street that i visited alright treacle
  i was in vegas last month we were looking for a quick place for dinner first off the restaurant was beautiful the service was great very helpful and the food the food was perfection i will definitely come back here again
  saw a groupon special for these guys 20 bucks for an all day play card plus a 10 dollar gift card i immediately grabbed 2 of them for my 2 boys ages 13 and 10 thought it was an awesome deal until we showed up on a saturday yes i can understand that it was gonna be busy because of the fact that it was a saturday but that s not my gripe my gripe is that a lot of the games were not working i would say about 40 percent were out of order even some of the newer games like the tank one my youngest noticed you can only go forward and cannot reverse so he was stuck behind a wall the whole game not able to do anything but get shot at another gripe is that other parents had the same idea so of course my kids had to wait for their kids to get off a game once they ran out of lives but in most cases they would just keep swiping their card basically just hogging the game the whole time there should be some kind of limit on how many times you can continue on an all day play pass for they can literally stay on a game the whole day which is rude in my opinion i also understand that since we had the unlimited play card it wouldnt generate any game tickets for obvious reasons this did not bother me at all again since some of the games were out of order the kids tried to make the most of it even the standard interactive games like the basketball shot one only 4 out of the 6 was working but technically only 2 was worthy of playing due to those having a decent amount of balls to play with while the others had only 2 or 3 looking around i saw some of the balls were stuck on top of the actual arcade after about 90 minutes of playing the same games over and over again my kids were bored already to the point they just wanted to go home memo to the gameworks staff dont you guys have some kind of technician that is on the clock repairing those games that are broke at least a person that can keep the basketballs in order on the basketball arcade i am so disappointed from our visit that i dont see any reason to come back here you guys should change your name to gameswork because after coming here i am left scratching my head thinking do any of the games work yelp 2015 review 36 gameworks sometimes 535 overall
  had the ayce sushi lunch for 19 95 choose from appetizers noodles rice like kimichi chicken fried rice teriyaki chicken nigiri tempura rolls specialty rolls and vanilla strawberry green tea ice cream for dessert miso was very bland had zero flavor ordered the shrimp tempura and black dragon roll and lisa lisa roll avocado cream cheese and shrimp tempura yummy overall this place was decent great service and affordable prices
  i went here after i saw a friend post this on facebook after it was on triple d i went there around 8 30pm on a saturday night right before they were closing and it was still packed waiting a good 15 mins just to order what i got fontina burger with onion rings excellent grilled bbq chicken pizza somewhat tasty but i was full from my burger vanilla shake the blue cherry hit the spot also had a bite of the peanut butter and banana sandwich which is somewhat great but i couldn t eat it as a meal if i went to phx i would highly recommend this place
  the best place to eat after 1 a m if you haven t tried their szechwan beef noodle soup then try that first or have at least one person from your group order this dish my second favorite dish mooshoo chicken pork chinese style burritos with hoison sauce trust me you won t be disappointed we stop by everytime we re in vegas just like the regulars stop by el taurino in l a we stop by here in vegas hopefully you like it as much as we do
  elie and i came in for happy hour drinks and i m really glad we did the bar is lovely and the actual restaurant is really nice the drinks were delicious and strong and everything from the sour pickle martini to the smoky mezcal was excellent we had two drinks each sampling four decadent cocktails for only 24 i heart happy hour and this one rocks the food looked great worth trying next time around
  most every morning they mess up my coffee i don t understand the order board reads 8 sugars and my receipt reads 8 sugars and then my coffee comes out with all cream and no sugar i just don t understand
  had the worst experience with the food truck at first friday with a horribly rude employee working the window i purchased food and saw my food sit on the counter as new orders were stacked on top of mine 3 more orders to be exact the 4 orders sat for 4 5 minutes waiting on fries and as the orders were being called mine now on the bottom was called last order 96 as i saw her hand out 99 98 97 as i was asking for my order she ignored me as i asked her why it was waiting on the bottom when i didnt order fries i still had to wait for them because they were busy then the employee told me to shut up and refused to refund my order with so much competition its not a great idea to blow off your guests never again
  o goodness was this place amazing there wasn t anything that was disliked here we will be back without question
  it s been more than a week and this afternoon i was driving down the street thinking how much i was looking forward to the burger i know i m going to have for dinner tonight when i remembered it came back to me like a flash of light the most delicious burger i had recently i mean my mouth had the memory really the texture was perfect it was thick but moist not dense juicy and despite a giant bun the bread was soft and not overpowering where did i have that fantastic burger first frustration i know it s not the burger i m having tonight where was i when i had that burger i called dottsy z because i vaguely remembered her being present for the experience with her help i remembered it was the burger i split with don s a k a donjay at district man that was a good burger now i m a little less looking forward to the burger i m having tonight although a value it will not be as good i m grateful for the memory and can assure you the next time someone asks where can i get a great burger downtown i ll remember i recommend adding green chile quite possibly my favorite downtown downtown happy hour the pretzel fondue is a steal as are the well drinks
  zookz is the best sandwich in the game period most sandwiches in phoenix are overpriced traditional particular boring whereas zookz is cheap unique healthy everyone from management to the cashiers are respectful loving i am always excited to eat the best sandwich in phoenix
  mexican food our favorite my husband and i have tried almost every mexican restaurant in vegas and this is our favorite we eat here almost every monday night i get the chicken and beef fajitas and he gets the camarones chipotle con crema everyone is so friendly the service is excellent try it for yourself
  this is one of our favorite thai restaurant in phoenix the food is excellent things you must try tom yum soup pad kee mao tom kha soup garlic chicken and mango delight their green tea ice cream is to die for another must try item though not on the menu i think
  got a salad for lunch the salad was small for the price also for such a small salad the service was slow for the same price jason s deli or energy cafe offers a much salad double the quantity for the same price i will not be returning for that reason service at the register was superb and the restaurant was clean so that was positive
  most amazing bagels n they always put a ton of cream cheese which is awesome because most places are cheap and give you one thin spread def recommend
  it s a classic can t hate on that haven t had a complete trip to the pitts without eating at primanti brothers ya know when you have a heaping pile napkins that it s finger lickn good always cheap and fulfilling doesn t get better than that cajun chicken is the bomb i must say
  the place was very dirty we sat looking at a table full of dirty dishes the entire time we were there a girl was sweeping or what should have been sweeping however she was missing everything stuff all over the floor my wife ordered the fajitas and they waited ten minutes to come and tell her they were out of beef i also have a problem with them charging for table entertainment for the use of the tablet at the table no where does it say you will be charged for its use that should be illegal
  i had the margarita pizza it was nothing spectacular the restaurant was clean and one of the least smoky places inside the golden nugget
  i have heard and read so many reviews about this place that i finally decided to check it out for myself just walking into the place it smelled so appetizing that i couldn t wait to start eating our waitress was very friendly and helpful with choosing the things off the menu because this is definitely not what you would call a typical burger joint we started off with the thai iced tea and then ordered the miyagi sans grass fed wagyu burger and the truffle parmesan fries the food did take a while to come out but that is because everything is prepared fresh the burger consisted of chili mayo fried egg crispy onion rings and caramelized onions it was so big that i could barely try to take a bite out of it the wagyu was so tender that it just melted in my mouth there was so much flavor in the burger that each bite put a smile on my face there is no certain way to describe the truffle parmesan fries with the dipping sauce except that it was like a party in my mouth the fries are drizzled with black truffle porcini cream and grated parmesan all the food is very reasonably priced and i wish i had room to try some of their dessert i can t wait to go back and try the different burgers and desserts on the menu i m not even a huge burger fan but i am in love with this place
  reuben s is a must on every montreal visit now melt in the mouth meat on great bread with stringy fries
  if your looking to have authentic mexican food then dont bother coming to elviras they serve you tortilla chips from a bag not freshly made as you would expect it comes with bottled salsa again not freshly made as you would also expect the food is sub par there were only 2 of us and they still got the order wrong the restaurant was less than half full but it took around 25 minutes to get our food slowwww service our waitress didn t check on us to refill our drinks so instead the bus boy did it for us first and last time going there
  i am not a pizza snob to me pizza hut papa johns dominos etc is sufficient to satisfy my pie cravings thus i am usually hesitant to hit up actual pizza restaurants unless the place offers personal pizzas you have to negotiate toppings with whoever you are sharing with and i am sure we all have that friend who thinks anchovies is a must have on top of that pizza restaurants are comparably overpriced compared to their take out delivery siblings with that in mind grimaldi s serves up some pretty good pizza but to me fails to impress their ingredients are for the most part better than their chain counter parts the pizzas aren t greasy or heavy in fact they only seem to have thin crust pizzas no deep dish for chi town peeps they are a bit overpriced for what you get and considering that they don t offer any custom or specialties pizzas i m left wondering i just overpaid for a simple pepperoni pizza i wish they had some more stand out ingredients or maybe a signature combo i ve been to this spot a few times and the service is pretty average the patio is a nice touch but the restaurant itself is pretty small call ahead on the weekends as most pizza joints have a slower turn over time and get packed on busier days
  this is the five star service and food you expect in las vegas the steak was cooked to the exact temperature it was juicy and buttered just enough my codfish was steamed to perfection being soft and delectable but firm on the fork the staff was also very friendly while still being professional the ambiance is elegant with just a splash of miami night club cheese which they have to have considering that the casino looks like frontier land at disneyland i would love to eat here again
  first time we ate here it was at the barbary coast the pit boss gave us a comp and told us to have the dinner of our life we kinda internally rolled our eyes thinking eh yeah right but cool we ll take a free meal wow we were wrong over the years we have kept coming back even though it s now at the south point a little bit away from the strip it s truly a gem it s very expensive but the service is hands down the best service i ve ever had in my life the food is great and each time we return it s the same servers who i m sure make a pretty penny working there all in all it s a fabulous dinning experience truly an experience
  love the food great price excellent customer service very friendly staff we would definitely come back here
  wendy s noodle cafe located at the western edge of chinatown in las vegas is a non descript looking building in which it in it s former life was a pizza restaurant wendy herself is a middle aged asian lady who re located from san diego a couple of year s ago first impression upon entering small place nothing fancy most of the patrons were androgynous college aged asians thought to myself glad my kids didn t go through this fashion phase i think when they were this age baggy pants were the fashion statement onto the food mango pudding no asian restaurant that i ve been to prepares mango pudding like this wendy s mango pudding is a triple layered pudding made with gelatin not milk based that you ll find at most other asian restaurants the pudding looked ok triple layered top and bottom layer were more opaque than the center layer which contained bits of mango ok in flavor but i didn t order j e l l o all the layers were made with gelatin all previous mango pudding ordered at asian restaurants were never made like this rating on yelp reduced to 3 stars based mainly on this disappointment 82 singapore noodles 1 2 perfectly made on a 6 square porcelain plate you ll receive thin vermicelli noodles with bean sprouts slivers of green onion red and green bell peppers stir fried with medium sized shrimp and slivers of chinese bbq pork smaller portion than at most asian restaurants salt pepper tofu 1 2 the square cubes of tofu are prepared like any other salt pepper entree fried at a high temperature until the tofu looks like small sandstone colored bricks the chef then tops off the entree with green onions and most impoerantly some sliced jalapeno peppers which gives this entree a real kick very very good i think the kids had some trepidations upon my ordering this entree but it became the most popular salt pepper calimari 41 won ton soup kathy s order of soup which she said tasted funny btw 15 minimum on debit credit cards
  good quality food and very consistent my group enjoyed the chicken tikka masala lamb karahi mutter paneer peas and homemade cheese in a coconut curry sauce with basmati rice and aloo paratha naan with potatoes and peas their vegetable samosas are pretty tasty too service could be much better we had to wait awhile to order the food dessert and then again for the ticket btw portions are pretty slim but the flavors all but make up for the small portions
  very good pizza i had the italian stallion if you love meat this is your choice crust cooked very well in the wood burning oven pretty good lunch crowd service was good my only complaint is that the smallest pie is 12 great for 2 too much for one while cold pizza is great at 7 am after sleeping one off it is so much better when still retaining original heat maybe if they offer a single serve pie lunch could stay under 20 for one
  wonderful place this is a wonderful out of the way old fashioned place the food is very good comfort food the entire place is spotless and the staff is amazing a visit here is like stepping back in time
  try the pizza regina delicious it comes with ham and mushrooms the ham thats on the pizza was thin cut and delicious it just melted in our mouths waiter was so polite and professional def next time i come to vegas i will be eating at suede
  this is my second time coming here for lunch and it was delicious todd english olives is located across from tiffany s and really close to the side valet super easy in out we sat our on the patio when it was like 90 100 degrees there weren t any misters on yet and the fountains never went off during our entire hour lunch kind of a bummer service was pretty good the server forgot my guests drink twice but it was quickly replenished when we brought it up i ordered chilled crab salad mixed greens asparagus shaved fennel cucumber roma tomato red onion mandarin segments red pepper coulis champagne vinaigrette 17 it was perfect for a super hot day my guest ordered a flatbread and really enjoyed it i also ordered a flavored iced tea that was really good maybe it was peach i would definitely come back here very good for a business lunch
  my favourite brunch spot in edinburgh bar none unique menu fresh juices and cozy decor still a winner
  a loooooot of hype about this place has been going on since i have been talking about how i was going to be in vegas this past weekend great local feel all the employees were like auntys and uncles hawaii slang and it was as if i was dining at some restaurant at home i had a hard time choosing between chicken katsu and the katsu loco moco they both sounded soo so osoo oosoosooo good not to mention the people around me were eating katsu loco mocos and i might have droooled a little but i stuck with ordering the plain katsu because i knew i wasnt going to be able to finish all of my food and so i thought it would be easier to save saving a katsu loco moco makes me think of soggy chicken katsu and idk if i am really a fan of that katsu was on point i love it when katsu is crispy and their katsu was just that omg and their macaroni salad was super delicious too they have huge pieces of pepper and it really gave your mouth a little kick while eating it i enjoyed that 2 scoops rice a mound of katsu and 1 scoop mac salad for 9 win win win they also give you a nice container of sauce im a sauce lover so i need lots of sauce 3 plus the service was so friendly and wonderful you need to eat half of your plate to get a take out box jokingly of course but we laughed i think all of us were a little beat up from clubbing and shennanigans from the night before so eating a large meal of meat and rice was not high up on the agenda before a 6 hour car ride to la still delicious though and i am actually eating my leftovers as i type this
  i am so full great food always wanted to share some pictures it s so hard not to eat the food before i take the picture tonight i tried something called magic carpet ok i was skeptical too but you gotta try it btw i don t like cream cheese but its good spicy tuna tomato cream cheese and kiwi on a crispy fried won ton skin omg sounds weird the kiwi and all but who would have imagine that its so yummy give it a try
  vegetarian perspective so upon seeing a very cool show called recycled percussion my friend alida shout out and i decided to get some grub it was her pick so tis all her fault haha kidding pros great parking space easy to find directionally friendly service cheap i ll take quality over price any day beautiful ambiance seat yourself vibe with casual attire etc neg has to do with showing up with an empty stomach but open mind and thinking it s ramen i love ramen not a vegan so there s bound to be something alida was kind enough to initiate the question of what do you have for veg s response nothing nothing for vegetarian i do highly appreciate that the waitress knew her menu and communicated that to me honestly upon an awkward shall we leave look she offered to have a dish of fried rice egg no pork custom made and it was delicious just sucked being hungry but hey it was a good meal reasonably priced alida enjoyed her dish and she is not allowed to choose the next restaurant ha
  we ordered 2 appetizers 3 entrees and 2 desserts we finished all cuz the french taste is never heavy and all ingredients just go well and balance each other this place is indeed nice and all foods are so delicate and delicious it s the second time i came in the first time is 4 yrs ago when i traveled with fds to canada although they have a small variety choice on menu they do change it once a while i wanted to order a duck based entree cuz the pics on yelp looks good but they don t have it anymore will come back later probably as my expectations is still rolling d
  gaucho parrilla argentina would make an excellent ambassador for pittsburgh s food scene to any transplants or tourists arriving in the city it s simultaneously a one of the best sandwich makers in the city that stands out from the crowd and b a restaurant that fits right in with the growing and diverse offerings of an increasingly delicious strip district with many cuts of steak available in sandwich or platter form i m a fan of the sandwiches myself none of the options are bad choices you could make random selections from this menu and still be just as happy as if you put hours into crafting your order it s all great stuff and i have no advice to visitors other than get a steak sandwich and anything else that looks good to you you won t be disappointed the primary drawback is space it can be hard to find a place to eat once your food is ready especially if the weather closes the outdoor seating area still it s worth the wait in line and the hassle of seating though it s still a far cry from being good for groups
  the food is great and the drinks are strong two drinks and you are feeling happy
  place is legit have had dinner and breakfast here and was happy both times more people should come here and spread the word the vibe is chill and the staff is somewhat nice some need a tip of smile and be nice
  great atmosphere great view great drinks great food there is nothing that disappoints me more than paying for a mediocre meal mon ami gabi always lives up to my vegas expectations this place was such a treat i enjoyed some fresh oysters shrimp cocktails house baked bread and a main course while sipping on frangria a french sangria and enjoying the bellagio water view you can enjoy a dinner with friends or a romantic dinner with your significant other
  i order from here often more so because it s close and the minimum is only 10 which you cannot beat especially when their lunch special runs until 4pm quick delivery i order the cashew chicken only with a taro bubble tea although i order at least once every month i do feel there are better tasting chinese food else where doesn t take away from the pros i feel are worth it if you have no transportation
  my last review of this place was 3 2011 and i still love the hell outta this place the food is very good varied and inexpensive they have a really great happy hour too my faves are their spicy korean beef crispy calamari and sushi combo great deal service is consistently spotty we went about a month ago and our server kept breaking glasses as she was really rushed that was annoying as we were seated by where she was breaking the glasses i love the bread they bring to the table but when i recently ordered takeout 45 worth of food the guy told me they no longer provide it free for takeout and would have to charge per roll cheap regardless i love this place and will continue to return even if i have to deal with the inconsistencies
  the ribeye is a must order the chicken entree as an appetizer enjoy the best two things on the menu
  i am not even sure this qualifies as a hole in the wall with that said their food is the bomb try the confeit or pork belly one of the best sandwiches i have ever had
  i was very dissatisfied with my first visit to this restaurant i saw some nice pictures from friends and i wanted to experience the same early in the afternoon they had run out of two popular dishes big bone soup and lobster pho as well as their coconut ice cream i know certain dishes in restaurants do run out due to popular demand but in those cases i would expect the staff to at least suggest alternative dishes they didn t even do that or show much empathy to the fact that i was disappointed that they didn t have what i wanted this staff lacks customer service and pride for their food and restaurant what i got was a waitress that alternated with another waiter while they clearly displayed a miscommunication of service at the beginning these two made them selves available to take our order at different times when we had already given our order to one of them then they alternated breaking the news of the dishes they ran out of in my opinion one unavailable dish is permissible two is cause for concern and three means they may need to fire their purchaser they have good product but the business is amateur my visit was 1 3 15
  mert s was amazing i had the fried chicken mac n cheese and collards good sized servings at really good prices my boyfriend got the beef ribs mashed potatoes and mac n cheese everything was delicious the waitress we had was on point she was friendly energetic and extremely fast i will be going back
  ate here for lunch with the wife we shared the smashed meatball sandwich i started with a caesar salad and i do not know what they do to those croutons but damn they are good head up on the salad they are heavy with the anchovies i did not mind it and almost licked my salad plate clean then the meatball sub came out the meatballs were awesome the bread nice and crunchy and the right amount of cheese more mozzarella than ricotta we both enjoyed the meal and left full the waiter seemed like he was in pain the way he was moving around almost like he through he back out of something so maybe that was why we did not seem to be in that great of a mood all and all a great meal and will try it again on another trip
  rude waitress she didn t listen didn t get the order right but i bet if i was a guy alone she would have paid attention noisy noisy and cold not a pleasant environment for dinner the wings were like jerky just as dry and tough but the pizza was good not enough for me to want to actually eat there again
  pretty good this place ranks a close second out of the top 3 buffets in vegas i think wicked spoon has the best food and a more hip cosmopolitan ambiance however bacchanal has much better food than wynn buffet ambiance at wynn is probably more elegant though overall i enjoyed my meal we had a good server who made sure to bring additional sodas and take away our plates they had crab legs that were halved making the crab meat easy to access the people behind the counter seemed rather lazy and reluctant to warm the crab legs but at least they did i can t remember any particular buffet dish that stands out the dining area is quite comfortable the lighting is just right and the seats are comfortable too the buffet looks new clean and nice if wicked spoon wasn t open this would be the next buffet choice for sure
  my wife and i ordered takeout from brugos alarm bells should have been ringing when i walked in to pick up my order and found the place almost empty and the only people who were in there were at the bar drinking not eating basically if you like poor quality pizza this is the place for you i ordered a caesar salad which for some reason had tomato in it if you can t make a caesar salad right what hope the rest of the stuff and so it proved cheesy garlic bread was next up it was basically a pizza base absolutely covered in pretty tasteless mozzarella i can only assume they forgot to add garlic since i certainly couldn t taste any of it so basically it was cheese on toast they did include a small pot of what i presume was supposed to be marinara sauce but was instead tomato paste with some basil in it i think it was basil since this was straight out of a can tomato paste the taste of that was so overpowering it was hard to tell exactly what the green flecks of matter suspended in it were finally we get to the pizza the crowning glory of a pizza restaurant and we d only ordered a classic margarita surely a pizza restaurant can t get that wrong actually they can it was essentially more of the cheesy garlic bread only this time instead of putting the marinara sauce in a pot they had helpfully layered it underneath the tasteless mozzarella it effectively rendered the tasteless mozzarella a binding agent only so overpowering was the tomato paste there were some tiny pieces of chopped basil on top of the pizza that were completely defeated by the overpowering tomato no fresh tomato on the pizza though presumably they had used all of them in the caesar salad this place was saved from the embarrassment of one star by the fact the order was prepared quickly when i phoned it in they said it would take 30 minutes but when i turned up in 20 minutes it was ready for me of course had i waited the 30 minutes they d said it would have gone cold but i m feeling charitable really avoid this place i ve genuinely had better from pizza hut added on 11 5 13 i ve just seen the owners response to my review and had to comment further they proudly claim that our margarita pizza is my sicilian families recipe why does that make the slightest bit of difference just because your family is from sicily doesn t mean they can cook they might be terrible at cooking their recipes might have been considered the worst in sicily maybe that s why they had to move to the usa so slavishly following them doesn t mean your product will be any good where any of your produce comes from and the recipes followed is irrelevant if the end product doesn t taste any good do you actually taste the homemade sauce you use and make sure it doesn t taste like overpowering rubbish you can get from a can oh and by the way thanks for pointing out that i could have requested you not put tomato on the caesar salad it s nice to know that it was in fact my fault that i didn t get what any normal person would consider a caesar salad
  growing up on old school country i have wanted to try a gilley s for sometime just to indulge my heart and nostalgia this place is located right on strip adjacent to casinos but with a window view of the night life outside despite the what happens in vegas mentality i wanted to exercise some level of discretion and not totally let my diet go they have some grilled chicken options including the one i picked that was fresh hot not greasy and tender the karaoke and bronco riding were entertaining had some fun festive drinks on the menu after my poor tired feet had walked up and down it hit the spot
  currently sitting in drive thru going on 32 mins with only 2 cars in front of me saw 7 people walk in and come out within 5 mins of going in why have a drive thru if you re going to act like it s not there utterly ridiculous for a company whose primary appeal is speed i could have ordered barros instead
  we ve been to hanny s a dozen times before it s been our go to place when we re going to the theater or symphony normally the service is great the food is outstanding and the bar is the best around unfortunately our experience this past saturday really disappointed as always the food and drink was excellent but the experience was unbelievably marred by loud booming music and indifferent service now i know that hanny s has a dj and loud music but we were in the restaurant at 5 45 pm not midnight i asked the server if the bass could be turned down something i ve never done at a restaurant before the answer we received i m pretty sure they won t turn it down and i m not even sure they can hmmm the music changed and the distracting boom of the bass subsided for a few minutes but another track and more annoyance our server didn t seem to want to be bothered to even ask sadly i guess we won t be bothered to return
  was good i like the seafood entrees i d ask for a little leaner salmon cut and a less creamy rice bed also how about warm bread with oil and vinaigrette the bread wasn t warm and only served with oil just a suggestion
  this is a bit over due and ergo hazy but i remember the chips and salsa were nothing short of ah mazing i was in town for thanksgiving and the man and i made the trek here to meet up with an old high school friend that i hadn t seen in well in awhile the food was great and the chips and salsa did i mention ah mazing we stayed around after they left and moved to the bar but oddly enough after another round or so of drinks and way before the asu cal game was over the place was closing up and like 10or 11ish weird other than the chips salsa i don t really have a reason to drive to bfe mom in surprise dad in fountain hills and i live out of state but i really enjoyed the place
  the food was good the prices was a little steep 10 little pieces of shanghi lumpia for 8 00 are you kidding me
  all i can say is kids eat free on sunday i have a family of five and it s not cheep to go out to eat i feed everyone foe 25 bucks it s great and the kids get free ice cream
  i ve been here a few times now for all the fun edm extravaganzas that they put forth i m pleased to say that i haven t been let down once there aren t that many bars in north scottsdale that are actually worthy of bragging about its a bit of a hidden location but hey who cares there is a pool cabanas and a young crowd entertaining crowd that fills the place with good times the only thing that kept this review from being 5 stars is that the bartenders jip you on drinks i would like some alchohol with my little cup full of ice looking forward to zeds dead on the 8th
  this review is for the kosher market not for the adjacent restaurant which i have never tried i drive 20 miles to get here a couple of times a month why not for the prices which are in line with other kosher stores in this area but definitely not cheap not for the ambiance which is clean but crowded and a little disorderly here s why imperial kosher tries to serve the needs of the kosher community in a very small store and it succeeds selection is surprisingly large for such a small space they seem to have most of the essentials including meats cheeses and a full service deli most importantly somebody has spent time trying to get good quality products on the shelves not everything marked kosher is something you would enjoy eating but imperial has found a lot of worthy items don t be afraid to try a brand you don t know well this is a true family place so don t expect supermarket like efficiency but do expect friendly service and people who care about their customers imperial suggestion for your restaurant at off hours anyway consider making it into a self service coffee tea bar make some reading materials available sell a few pastries maybe your customers will hang around for a while you could be a cool meeting place
  great sunday happy hour the food is absolutely delicious and the staff very friendly and efficient
  one of the best dinner buffets we have had fresh quality and a lot of different variety of food yum def going back when we go to vegas
  let me get the logic behind secret pizza they re opened to 4 5 a m the drunk and partially drunk slur their way in to get that sober me up munchies on wouldn t you want a sign up to attract more customers how passively cruel is that to the wobbly and incoherent wandering like zombies seeking to feed one could only chuckle at the priceless visual as they search for secret pizza contrarians sober people would say signs would defeat the purpose of their marketing goal it wouldn t be called secret pizza logic is never logic if drunk through the corridor on the right of the japanese restaurant within the cosmopolitan you ll find secret pizza there i said it if that s not enough you re probably too drunk to even eat within this hallway is a massive collection of interesting prints of musicians i think they were musicians the pizza aroma pulled my attention away from the pictures my monstrous hunger which developed from searching the menu told me to get two slices give up looking for a poster board list menu or what have you just ask because there are none peering down through the glass i eventually chose the meat lovers and the cheese with white sauce pizzas are the thin crust my crusts were a tad burnt on the edges after the oven warm up each crispy bite was filled with a healthy so to speak dose of cheese and ingredients both slices were delicious both had surprisingly good taste considering since they were just thrown into an oven and reheated for a minute no time for a sit down dinner want a quick slice or whole pizza or need some grease to relieve your drunkenness secret pizza can be a strong option that is if you can find it
  sushi koma i love sushi night mighty roll everytime yummy d best sushi place ever and amazing staff one time i was cold and they turned the air down for me _
  5star service our first time here and everything couldn t have been more perfect from the looks of the giant video billboard outside advertising 5 99 lunch specials we expected average mexican fare we got much more not only was the food excellent the service was equal to the likes of the pointe the food brunch served from 10 30 4 00 i got the south of the border ranch style eggs with pork chile verde eggs basted the taste of the pork was superb you can tell everything is made fresh the food didn t come out in 5 minutes either so it s apparent they take their time making everything to order she had the breakfast tostada substituting fajitas veggies for the meat otherwise served with chorizo again all the ingredients were fresh and tasty the little things john our waiter is low key extremely helpful and knowledgeable he knows how to adapt many dishes for the vegetarian and gluten free eaters we never had to ask for a thing if we needed an extra napkin it was on the table before we had to ask used creamer and sugar packets were immediately bussed a new cup of coffee was on the table just as i was finishing my last sip the manager jason made a nice appearance and welcomed us after the meal john spent a little extra time socializing but otherwise he was the invisible waiter who took care of all our needs we ll be back and next time we re bringing our son on sundays for face painting and because kids eat free thanks arriba
  went there with the hubby and 3 friends for breakfast yesterday and was very impressed the restaurant was busy and active and the ambience was very diner friendly we had a waiter who was really friendly and a lot of fun making us laugh and really being social he really impressed us all with his ability to memorize everyone s orders and not have to write any of it down he was awesome and we left him a pretty good tip our food was really delicious everyone in our party liked what they ordered and one of our friends took the rest of their s home for later i had the lil jay which featured a waffle and cheesy eggs and added a chicken breast to my order had ice cold grape kool aid with it my order was absolutely delicious and very tasty perfect amount of food for me and i came away feeling satisfied and content it was a good meal choice to begin the day with and i was still full when i went to the diamondbacks game later on i recommend this restaurant to anyone in search of something different
  went back to try the dim sum here last sunday havent been here in 2 years wish i wouldve stayed away the food was ok good overall for arizona but the choices and lack of food really was a turn off it was about 1245 not late by dim sum timing but they were already wiped out of all food we tried to order more there just wasnt anything to order i am chinese and very used to having to chase down the carts for food when they are busy but this was silly the tripe was definitely a unique style and the chicken feet were pretty tasty about all i can say about the food i will stick to phoenix palace for the east valley
  i love this place my boyfriend and i visit this place as often as we can for discounted bottle nights last night we had a 50 bottle for only 19 service and food is exceptional eric has served us a few times and he s very nice and knowledgeable they also project a nice movie above the bar which is a nice touch a
  a new bbq shack offering a variety of different sandwiches combo plates ribs salads wings and more you can also buy whole family sized meals and chopped bbq pork or chicken by the pound apparently by the name the ribs must be their specialty though i opted for the smothered pork sandwich which was chopped pork with slaw on a toasted bun see pics out of the 12 different sides i chose mac and cheese i wasn t impressed with the mac and cheese it was too processed for my liking but i did like the sandwich the meat had a nice flavor and the slaw was crisp and refreshing i would likely return to have that sandwich again i m gonna go with 3 stars for now until i have a chance to try some more items but all in all it was a good experience service by friendly staff in a clean industrial shack dining area looks like they have a happy vally and glendale location too
  great cafe diner ordered the turkey and links breakfast all american breakfast grilled cheese
  this is my go to place for breakfast my bf and i come here at least 1 a week everything on the menu is amazying the people the waitress and food is what makes us a regular customer i really recommend the breakfast and poutine yummmm
  not bad free pool and ping pong in the main bar area and 75 cent pool in the adjoining room 2 beer specials decent bartending i don t know i mean it was okay i guess didn t blow me away it was pretty loud though and the bartender girl played that three doors down song superman i think three times in a row which is just unbelievably annoying and makes me really want to give it only 2 stars but i enjoyed the pool area enough
  the best burger ever
  better then panda express thats all i can say
  the custom made pizza is amazing great sauce and toppings options all included in the price of the pizza they don t charge extra for each topping i also love their watermelon tea my family loves this place we eat here often good food and good prices
  so yelp page says open until 8pm drove all the way here employees inside with door unlocked and signage blinking open told me they were closed i stated their yelp page said hours until 8pm today assuming the owner blamed his wife for setting up the page and said the other location was open until 8pm bad service bad attitude i m really looking for a good sandwich shop i come from a great city that has much better food than las vegas and i was hoping this would be the place but i won t be going back
  really terrific bbq experience i will return every time i m in phoenix i was the first in line by opening time the line was long when i entered the owner handed me a chunk of brisket wow i was hooked i ordered burnt ends and they were just incredible also had some terrific sausage but the brisket is the shining star i would go back and order 2 lbs of the brisket if i could
  one of my favorite buffets in las vegas so many options so delicious creative and unique and great decor long wait but it s expected yummy crepe station both warm and cold crab legs choices go on and on great tasting food desserts
  watching them make the coffee is what made me give them 5 stars the atmosphere is very laid back with a very cozy kind of layout the people are very nice and the cappuccino is definitely on point you can t take it to go bc of the art of the foam made on top and i think that is amazing this place is truly a great coffee shop and this is their second location i found out and hopefully they will keep adding more it s great and will definitely come back every chance i get back in arizona
  i m just going to throw it out there right away i had modest expectations for the deck this dilworth bar restaurant has been renamed so many times in the past few years however i am happy to say that i m a big fan of the deck some friends and i strolled over to the deck to grab a few drinks after dinner inside it reminds me of a charleston style restaurant very beach focused with a large bar and a smattering of tables we were interested in actually sitting on the deck at the deck so we rolled on upstairs and grabbed a table with a view of east blvd my review is solely based on their drinks but i m definitely interested in heading back for some nosh the drink menu is really diverse and our friendly server mentioned that they do their best to use natural ingredients they even make their own sour mix in house the five of us ordered all different drinks beer wine and i ordered the deck margarita the margarita was right on par for 9 it was fairly large and had pleeenty of salt on the rim mmm sodium all of our drinks were tasty and priced moderately for the area i definitely want to head back to the deck for some drink specials a bit of live music and to try their strawberry basil lemonade
  grampa s is an exceptional experience we have been here twice and both visits have been lovely it provides a dark and intimate setting tuesday is date night the price includes an appetizer pizza dessert and a bottle of wine perfect we have tried both the brassecre pizza and the barberini pizza both are wonderful but the barberini had many complex flavors that made it quite special it is very saucy but the honey and creamy cheese add layers of smoothness to the spice of the sauce the cheese board is a great starter with a bottle of wine the sticky ginger cake is literally the best dessert i have ever had in addition the music is perfectly suited to the atmosphere featuring billie holiday and french songstresses yes you have to wait for a table but it is more than worth it it may even be part of what makes the experience special
  service is usually good their salads are my favorite nice to come here if you want a quiet lunch or dinner
  the food was great the service not so much my family and i checked out serendipity for lunch on sunday morning it was pretty crowded when we arrived around 10 am so we were told we would have to wait for 20 30 minutes i really liked how the hostess was using an ipad that would message my iphone when our table was ready you are given the option of sitting inside or out but we wanted inside because it was getting really hot outside already thankfully we only had to wait 10 or so minutes before i received a text saying our table was ready when we sat down our table was pretty wet since they just cleaned it we ordered really quickly since we had looked at the menu while we were waiting and we figured it shouldn t take that long to get our food unfortunately we waited 30 40 minutes for our breakfast ___ i was getting really hungry since we were seeing all the people around us receive food and we weren t getting squat finally our food came over and we were amazed by how big the portions were my pancakes were ginormous my mom s steak sandwich was an entire baguette and my boyfriend s waffles were the size of your head blueberry pancakes super nom they put a good amount of blueberries in there and they don t drown the pancakes in butter like normal places do syrup was great and on the side steak sandwich massive the steak was very good and they add bacon and three fried eggs to the sandwich the bread is an entire baguette aka way too much for one person to finish the potatoes on the side were over seasoned too salty and they burned the first batch so we made them make some more corned beef hash and eggs nom the hash here is super fresh and meaty wow i was jealous of my dad s plate after he gave me a bite of the hash they give you 4 pieces of bread though which was kind of overkill banana cream waffles satisfy your sweet tooth two waffles with bananas cream raspberries blackberries and chocolate sauce not for the faint of heart all in all the food was delicious but our server forgot about us and it s very difficult to get the server s attention since there is so much going on here
  ugh stopped in here before a diamonbacks game and quickly left after a beer it s tiny cramped but not in a fun packed house kind of way and so very dark it was kind of a mood killer they do have a patio but didn t have the misters on and weren t serving out there with all the beautiful weather we get in arizona i hate being cooped up in dark small places
  a really fun place to go hang out and have a few drinks i went last night with some friends and we had a blast it is really cool inside since it is a tiki hut the food was really good i had some potstickers macaroni and chicken wings with plenty to go around and great to share also the sweet potato fries are really good too i would definitely recommend this place
  really fun the show is very entertaining and the musicians are very talented
  good carne asada burrito number 1 chicken is not great
  i came here almost a year ago but never wrote a review this place serves hot fresh food they grow the food on the land behind the restaurant it was so good that i went back multiple times to try different items on the menu it s a bit of a drive from tempe but i think it s worth the drive
  i like this place the steaks are solid the sides are the usual fare the lobster mac n cheese is over hyped but not horrible 38 the service is also pretty solid depending upon how busy they are i like to play at the nugget so its pretty convenient the mood is dark and old schoolish except for the flat screens over the bar kinda odd but i don t really mind it just don t ever remember seeing it before the lobster tails are from fukushima nuclear plant i have never seen them so big serious 3 eye action there all and all pretty solid but not the best
  i ve been going to florencia for a few years now and overall i really like it i m from the east coast so i find it difficult to find really good pizza here i think the quality is great and the atmosphere is pretty cool too the owner not sure who it is staff s it with mostly local high school kids which i find great he or she is helping employ locals overall i like this one a lot
  are you kidding me the best food ever i don t even write reviews but i had to stop midway thru my meal to do it this is too yummy for the price the atmosphere the service five stars hands down wish i lived closer or there was another bravo by my house
  i swear to god one of these days yelp will give us the option for half stars until then it s going to be three for me whereas it would ve been 3 5 i like cooper s really i do the food is pretty solid and so is the beer selection the problem well it s overpriced a lot of their beers run 5 and while that s a bargain price in dc or ny this is madison and i don t expect to pay that much even their specialty selection which usually has a sour or two is way too much the selection is good overall but if i want to really go all out i ll head over to maduro or out east to the malthouse now the food well as with most food fight places it s hit or miss stealthily delicious hummus platter i think it s beet hummus but not sure so so sliders and so so poutine pronounced putin believe it or not cooper s has a really cool atmosphere but the meh quality of the food and pricey beer list is keeping me from giving it more than 3 stars would i hang out there absolutely as long as i didn t plan on drinking a lot
  the food is great but genesis pronounced heh neh sis for you gringos puts the food to shame tonight she is wearing sassy red lipstick that is to die for omg best bartender ever ask her for a tres amigos y gordo next time you re in she won t make it for you but she ll most likely flash you that bajillion watt smile of hers a worthy consolation prize indeed
  visited scottsdale and stopped in on the way from the airport to our hotel for a bite to eat we sat outside which was great the prickly pear margarita is just what i had a taste for and the chicken tacos were fantastic will definitely stop in here again
  red oak is a great spot if you are looking for a change in the food that is typically served in oakland red oak avoids the greasy persona of the surrounding venues and offers a tasteful spin on more nutritious entrees the restaurant offers daily specials which i am quite a fan of red oak is very vegan and vegetarian friendly red oak also offers a wide selection of sandwiches and wraps however given the scarcity of food that is tasteful healthful and served in a creative fashion i reccomend ordering the specials here
  i really don t know how these guys have 5 stars on yelp i went expecting this place to be amazing but was pretty dissapointed the portions were small for the price the food came very slowly even though there were only 3 4 parties there to be fair the servers were all very nice and friendly but i wouldnt go here if you re in a rush to be anywhere since i can t imagine how slow it would be on a busy night
  really awesome tacos the al pastor is my 1 i get some bad cravings for this food and i m not ashamed to admit it the guy running the register is super nice and funny
  just had the q at the midwood outstanding as it was my first time i went with the combo platter to sample various meats ribs pork brisket and sausage were my choices all were terrific sauces were good but nothing special the pickled onions were unusual but the perfect change up between the meats mac and cheese was exceptional i m stuffed i went early 5 00 pm on a saturday after reading how packed it gets glad i did by the time i left a hour and change later it was jammed sat at the bar and had terrific service from chad the bartender thanks chad bottom line i ll be back as often as i can
  excellent outstanding selection of great food coupled with attentive and energetic service highly recommend
  seriously the best red velvet cake in montreal red velvet cake is a southern specialty and not very well known in montreal it was a very popular cake in the 1950s this is exactly the sort of cake you d imagine elizabeth taylor indulging on in cat on a hot tin roof red velvet cake has only become popular in recent years due to 2 reasons jessica simpson and sex and the city which kicked off the whole magnolia bakery craze and cupcake craze it s not the real mccoy with 2 layers cream cheese icing and crushed pecans on the side but it ll do their other cakes like white black forest and strawberry cheesecake are great in fact they are a bakery also so you can order the cakes here as well a great spot to come with a friend and chat over cake and coffee or spend some time before or after a film at the amc service is kind of spotty and slow at times
  my husband and i have been going to fukuda now for 3 years every time we stop in for dinner it is amazing the chefs who prepare the sushi are so friendly and always make us feel like we are their 1 customer the owner always comes over to us and greets us the sushi is beyond delicious and always fresh fukuda has great specials daily and now they offer all you can eat sushi they don t fluff the rolls with extra rice and cucumbers like other all you can eat sushi restaurants tend to do we have never tried the any other menu options that they offer because we love the sushi i wouldn t go any where else in town for sushi we love fukuda
  tucked in the corner of a strip mall the misses and i finally found a worthy sushi bar on our side of town inside was very nice and clean we both enjoyed the modern appeal of the decor the misses mentioned that they had remodeled now on to the food the rolls were different than what i ve had at other sushi bars but to be honest i enjoyed that we both ordered the ayce which by the way includes 5 pieces of sashimi haven t been to a place that includes that with your ayce we started out with the tracy ii which was pretty good i kind of lost track of the rolls after that point oh i did enjoy the texture of the lisa lisa ended with the sasa and alex s munchie rolls both were delicious the staff were extremely nice and one of the waiters even asked us if this was out first time here he was very informative about the menu the chefs were also great i believe it was nick and i m guessing mark he made a couple of out of the box rolls for us they were both friendly and fun overall experience was great and i know we will be back thanks sasa suhi
  visiting from out of town and wanted a good vegan experience being from co we have excellent vegetarian vegan fare so my expectations were high we got the spicy edamame big wac and calexico burgers great flavor friendly service quick with the food order and arrival amazing experience w
  two weeks now having trouble getting the quality out of the kitchen my requests are being ignored this may have been my last trip here
  i ve probably ate at 50 pizza joints in my life so far and jessies is in my top 4 everything is great the knots the pizza is awesome thin chewy crust with thick cheese by the way their large 16 is bigger than a normal pizza places large 14 and you get your money s worth i try to order it once a week i just wish they could be open 24 7 aha trust me you have to try this
  in vegas and we were looking for a quick bite to eat decided to have fast food but wanted something new so we decided to drop by raising cane s chicken fingers and i ended up loving it so good so affordable and so fast the chicken fingers were so tender and it did not appear greasy whatsoever i ve been here a couple of times after the first time and my usual order is now the combo box which i share with my husband comes with four pieces of chicken fingers fries coleslaw texas toast one cane s sauce and a regular drink priced around 7 the combination of chicken slaw fries and toast together satisfies me in all ways the texas toast is by far the best toast i have ever had really the outer part of the bread is golden and crispy but once you pass that outer layer the middle part of the bread is so soft and just literally melts in your mouth love it
  for once i cannot say one bad thing about this place there skirt steak tacos are to die for and there margaritas are amazing nothing artificial is in these things just fresh squeezed juices and tequila this place is a bit upscale and pricey but well worth it
  actually a pretty good place owner is always there and very nice food is good and reasonably priced try the pistachio ice cream it s sooo good
  this is the best place for a full barbeque meal in champaign county li l porgy s has the best sauce black dog takes cake for the best pulled pork sandwich but hickory river cooks the best meal this is texas barbeque here beef brisket is king of all the bbq joints in town hickory river has the most side dishes and the biggest portions the sauce is incredible and the cafeteria design means you don t have to worry about tipping perfect some of the best bbq this bbq connoisseur has ever had
  came here because the rating was 4 and it did not disappoint delicious tacos tried the al pastor and friendly staff will definitely come again
  their chicken parmigiana was some of the best i have ever had in scottsdale and phoenix the waiters giovanni and eddy have been there about 20 years i am amazed to see them every time i go in the red sauce is definitely homemade and the owner is usually in the kitchen cooking i have also had their fresh fish of the day and cioppino it was better than what many of the local fish restaurants make the wine menu and drinks are priced at a good value i wish they had better cappuccino and espresso i noticed that they use a cheap home unit to make this and it definitely does not taste good the tiramisu and cheesecake are made in house and have great flavor i will be back next week
  quick one great place beautiful decor and vibe there were two of us for late dinner jessie was really cute and a great server eli one of the management crew came over to chat and was very kind this place is asian fusion tapas probably a little less mexican than they say innovate menu with smallish portions but priced like it strong flavors they re not afraid to go sour i had a couple of very thoughtfully put together cocktails there s a big drink menu and they have the mixology figured out
  first off the ambiance of the restaurant was extremely comforting and inviting it was definitely not what i expected in that location i believe that the location was previously an eat n park restaurant so this place is definitely an upgrade i was really impressed with the decor however that being said i thought that for the price of the food and the surroundings my overall impression of the restaurant was just okay here s my assessment of the food salsas decent for a dollar you couldn t complain however these are usually free in most restaurants antojitos wings okay barely seasoned queso stuffed pepper fire breathing sweat inducing tongue blazing hot and not much else puffed hominy tasty chicharones meh had them in miami at el palacio de los jugos and there is absolutely positively no comparison like comparing a ford pinto to a rolls royce the chefs at verde need to take a trip southward pollo tacos barely any flavor and for almost 5 per taco i can whip up better in my kitchen and have sides overall the rug didn t match the curtains in my opinion
  becareful of this drive through location they could care less if the order is accurate my order this morning was short by two yes two b burritos sadly this is normal and why i cointinue to visist this location and use it s drive through is beyound me i have written to the coproate office as the reviews for this store are horrible maybe it s time to shut this place down and put in a burger king
  i love the raseberry mouse and canollis every thing looks so yummy i am one about presentation the staff are friendly and helpful if you have a sweet tooth for some yummy desserts then i recomend you come to manan bakery
  trevi would not be a destination restaurant in vegas nor would it be my first choice for a business dinner which is the occasion that we were there trevi is situated in the the forum shops with majority of its seating in the mall the inside of the restaurant is very nice and comfortable with its high ceilings open kitchen and dark colors sitting in the restaurant rather than the patio is highly recommended the dinning room keeps all the mall noise out and it feels more like a restaurant rather than apart of a mall food court the service was great at first with prompt delivery of menus drinks bread and appetizers after the appetizers were served service became nonexistent after receiving the bill it turned out that the gratuity was already added it was then obvious as to why our server began focusing his efforts on smaller tables weather he sucked or not he was still getting his tip the food was not great or bad it was just something to cure your hunger we started out with the bread that they serve to each table and it really served no purpose but to fill your stomach with its complete lack of flavor for appetizer we shared a couple of pizzas that were the best part of the meal despite the canned tomatoes on the margarita pizza they were very good for dinner i ordered the bolognese pasta the pasta was cooked perfectly but the taste reminded me of olive garden we all shared dessert the tiramisu the hot molten chocolate cake and the ice cream were the highlight of the meal with the chocolate cake being the best of the three overall the food was bland unexciting really nothing special the food is on the same level of olive garden but the price is on the level of finer dinning if you re thinking of trevi for dinner keep walking and go to spago instead
  kazu is a montral classic and a downtown staple you can easily identify it on saint catherine by the long line in front of it even on cold winter days the food is original the prices are affordable and the environment is warm and always packed my absolute favourite dish is the chicken burger it must be one of the most important human inventions after fire which is necessary for grilling burgers
  in general i love bbq i grew up with a mom who raked snow and ice off the grill to bbq in the winter i tried a few bbq places when i first moved here but i gave up on bbq in phoenix shortly after moving here and i didn t eat bbq unless i cooked it unfortunately for all bbq places in phoenix past present and future as far as i am concerned there is lmbbq i try not to use another business name in my reviews and then there are all other bbq places in phoenix i stopped here on a whim to give this place a second try 2 years after the first time i was underwhelmed by the food that i tried i ordered the po boy sandwich a mountain of meat sausage brisket chef s choice and pulled pork the meat was far too saucy for me i do not care for sauce on my bbq i prefer the sauce as a garnish on the side i think it was added to the sandwich and i wish i had been asked the sauce wasn t very tasty itself the brisket was tender and juicy but it lacked a deep smokey flavor that i enjoy same for the brisket the sausage on my sandwich didn t taste fresh so i didn t eat it more than a bite or two rather unfortunate because i bet normally the regular sausage is good the only bright spot was the jalapeno sausage i ordered on the side that it just occurred to me didn t taste like it was spiced with jalapeno but black pepper nevertheless the sausage was not greasy and it tasted pretty good i really would like to see bbq places in and around phoenix win but this place is didn t satisfy my taste buds for phoenix i suppose it meets some folks needs for me its a do not return unless lmbbq burns down return factor 1
  beautiful restaurant adjacent to the palazzo the staff was excellent very accommodating without being overbearing we were served very good bread after being seated the wine list prices are double take inducing as it turned out the mark up on the excellent bottle of amarone that we ordered was under 100 so batali and the boys made a decision to showcase kick ass wines without being as rapacious as you might think wines by the glass would be a very reasonable alternative approach we started with the prosciutto which was excellent it literally melted in your mouth if you order this ask for the teeny little rolls that they serve you wrap a slice of prosciutto around a little roll and eat the combination we also had the duck egg with pastrami which was ok we each ordered the special dry aged steak which was aged a lot longer than their usual protocol the dry aging lends the meat a deep funky undertone that is an additional flavor usually missing from meat that said i m not sure how much it really adds we had some excellent mushrooms as a side dish truffle shavings couldn t rescue potatoes au gratin from mediocrity the only real negative to this place is the prices this is a really expensive steak house significantly more expensive than what i am used to in manhattan so there will be a lot of sticker shock i m not sure how the prices here compare to other las vegas steak houses so this may be the price of admission in this town for great steak and wine if you don t have a yolo attitude skip this place because it s a excellent restaurant but not a great value if you can get past the prices it s a very nice meal
  i was here a little while ago and absolutely love it i was at the downtown asu campus and wanted something to eat close by and randomly chose hob nobs the veggie sandwich i had there was great and the bread was delicious they even have gluten free pizza which is awesome it was a very inviting and comfortable place that i would and have recommend people to
  i agree with the other reviewers the service is subpar and i sat at the bar the beers are good but the board of beers on the wall is lacking in details i want to know when doing a tasting the restaurant also feels kind of empty i know their going with a minimalist theme but it s a little over the top
  not the healthiest menu but our server was really friendly and energetic we went for dessert and had some delicious slices of cake german chocolate and caramel
  charlotte needs more places like this tried it first because of a groupon deal but now i m a regular customer very friendly staff good service and consistency i have only had the hamburgers so i cannot give a review of the hotdogs or other food i always try to tell myself i m gonna get something different next time but just can t help going with the chubz double deluxe
  at kaya it s more like a happy happy happy hour with strong tasty drinks and delicious munchies i m a big fan of the frozen mango mojito and the grapefruit basil margarita soooo yummy during happy hour with 1 2 off drinks it s a pretty awesome deal their spicy bean dip is also pretty delicious the first time i came to kaya the chips that came with the dip were a little too hard but the second time i came back they had the kinks worked out and the chips were perfect thanks rachel c for recommending this place
  this was my 2nd visit to savoy went here on a groupon simply amazing place with delicious food i really appreciate how the owner was able to renovate an old building in the strip district into this beautiful restaurant and club lounge the menu is definitely a little pricey but it s really worth it in my opinion especially for special occasions and date nights if money wasn t an issue i would eat here at least once a month environment i m a sucker for restaurants with modern atmospheres and savoy doesn t disappoint in this regard as soon as you walk in the vibe is just awesome the mood lighting is just right too a live jazz band was playing on the main floor which added to this however we eventually were seated downstairs in what they call the owner s room which is a small room with about 6 tables in it and a flat screen tv this came off a little cheesy to me and i felt a bit separated from the rest of the patrons but this is just a personal peeve of mine for the full savoy experience i recommend asking to be seated on the main floor and not in the basement food as for the food i ordered the lamb chops which at 38 is the most expensive entree on the menu but i had a groupon that allowed me to order whatever i wanted so why not the size of the chops are very generous and they are served over risotto it was unbelievably delicious for dessert my wife and i had salted caramel chocolate cake with banana ice cream i hope i wrote that correctly it was amazing and they give you such a generous amount i could hardly finish it i can t wait i go back here again
  i d say 3 5 decent food restaurant atmosphere is simple
  definitely sad to see sole no longer occupying this spot best tres leches of all time but definitely wanted to give italian pie a shot we ordered a small pizza and a calzone the pizza was really good the calzone was just so so beer specials were good decent price but they didn t have feature any italian beers which was a little disappointing the decor honestly is a step backward from what it was with sole and frankly that hurt my overall scoring i would definitely go to this place if you live close enough for a pizza run the pie was good
  when i walked in the woman was on her cell phone texting and it took about a minute before she noticed me she was nice once she saw me but then the phone rang another worker answered and it was a personal call so while chit chatting on the phone she proceeds to slowly grab my pizza out of the oven it was rather annoying but lets get to the food medium supreme i loved the dough it had a sweetness to it but not a ton of cheese also had an order of medium wings yuuummmyyy ill return maybe try a stromboli next time
  wow what a letdown i sat at the bar completely overlooked by the bartenders who by the way apologized twice but continued to take orders from patrons who arrived after me and were literally standing behind me maybe they were friends or regulars who knows but whatever the reason they got priority service three other people who were hanging out with us finally left sans drink they took off for don t tell mama and reported back that they were served immediately jessica c and i decided to suffer through the wait with our parched palates and carry on it was a poor decision and we should have left with the other three the bartenders were busy park was busy that is a fact but not an excuse if you can t execute under pressure you are in the wrong business they get 2 stars for the beer selection and garden but that doesn t matter yuck
  as far as restaurant reviews i go i m pretty easy going i hardly ever rate less than a 3 but this restaurant probably deserves a one the only thing keeping it from a one is the fact that it was clean we called for a reservation in which we were told that they didn t take reservations for two when we got there tons of spacious 4 seater tables were available but they stuck us back in a two seater wedged literally a food between two other tables when we asked to be moved they indicated that they had a lot of four person reservations but if the tables were open after a few minutes we could move we were never offered those other tables which stayed open the entire 90 minutes we were there then when the couple next to us left we asked again to move one table over they indicated that it was reserved and we could not move again two people were seated at the table not sure how that happened since they said policy indicated that they didn t take two person reservations so if seating doesn t bother you and you ve rolled your eyes and skipped over the top section let me discuss the below par food we ordered the chicken cordon blue let s just say that if i closed my eyes and took a bite of chicken mcnugget and one of arrivederci s chicken cordon blue bites i would not know which was which my vegetables that accompanied my dish were mostly just a pile of red onions to top it off my famous crab cake was more mayonnaise than anything else however my husband enjoyed his stuffed shells the experience and food we got was not worth the 70 dollars we paid and i will never come back here again
  so after reading a lot of positive reviews we decided to try this place decor looked nice and casual the server named alex showed us the drink menu and we decided to try the bellini 12 it was just a champagne glass of red colored champagne for the entree we ordered the dry aged ribeye and the seafood chopped salad the ribeye was over cooked dry and served on a cold plate no way the meat is worth 50 so we sent it back alex suggested we should try the regular ribeye instead so we did but it wasn t much better the salad was very small smaller than a typical half salad we do not recommend this restaurant
  i lived in madison for a year before moving to ny a few months back this is by some distance my favorite restaurant in madison and madison food scene is no push over the baked goat cheese and the scallops are particularly memorable my wife who is vegetarian found the food excellent particularly the truffle fries and bruschetta the wine flights here are famous of course but the cocktails were a pleasant surprise too
  they don t have they re act together service is very slow food is not bad hoping to see some improvements
  open late and a nice place to just chill by the window overlooking from a second floor from the street and enjoy a great cup of tea and a biscotti i came in here after strolling around near my hotel and wanting to relax but not stay in my hotel room doing so the service is extraordinarily friendly and kind the biscottis are gigantic and they heat them up before they bring them to you i got the pistachio one and it was ok too much white chocolate which i have taken a liking to recently but was wanting something more nutty it s not to say it was bad but just not what i was craving for the moment they also have a cappuccino one and a double chocolate one that both looked yummy if you re itching for a chocolate fix the seats are comfortable and i spent around an hour here through about 11 30pm it s not loud even though they have tvs on with it turned to the sports channel it s mostly people who are on their own studying or working it s close enough to mcgill university too and nice that it s open late for being in the downtown area i think midnight
  it s like chipotle but i don t know which one came first well that doesn t matter and the only important thing is the food is good they do have more choices than a chipotle and 2 items that come to mind are quesadillas and nachos if you like assembly line burritos give it a try
  a must try if you re in the area the flavors are rich unlike other places where it might taste watered down good little space for hanging out with friends as well
  went there for a bday party it was a great new experience to sit at the pour your own tap table check it out is was different and great you wont find anything else like it in town
  absolutely gorgeous interior with a southern plantation feel i love a menu that accommodates foodie adventurers and more conservative eaters seafood options ridiculously delicious looking burgers that are practical to eat not so big around that a normal sized person can t bite into it and decent salad options for someone trying to eat relatively light that being said anyone who goes to the henry and doesn t get the truffle oil fries is missing the boat i m actually dreaming about them as i write this for the folks who prefer to drink their calories no shortage of options here either great cocktail menu wide selection of carefully chosen beers and a wide selection of wines this place is the perfect happy hour spot bonus the interior is acoustically pleasing as well no straining to hear the person across the table from you it was so inviting for conversation that we actually met and shared an appetizer with the two wonderfully witty gentlemen that sat down next to us nice
  i ve passed this restaurant for a few times now and didn t want to risk wasting a thai food meal when lotus of siam and komol are in the same plaza since we didn t want to wait we decided to give this restaurant a try when entering it has a quiet atmosphere it was not half filled with excellent modern decorations and very clean as others have mentioned the prices here are higher when compare to komol the presentations of the dishes are hands down beat both lotusofsiam and komol i had a tom yum soup with shrimp and it was the best tasting tom yum soup i have had their spicy mint with ground pork was a bit on the sweet side and not spicy enough this dish was just alright for me their steam rice was a bit on the wet side i would definitely come back to get the tom yum soup again and will try another entree i would rate this place a 3 5 since i wasn t impressed with the spicy mint
  good food worth a try
  the customer sevice and ambiance here are always great the managers have always taken care of any issue we ve ever had the prime rib is really really good so is the steak au poivre that said i have to admit that the rest of the food can be pretty hit and miss i ve never had awful food here but several disappointments the managers and staff are so polite and work so hard to make things right that we keep coming back the pricing is a bit high for the inconsistent quality but well worth the early bird and happy hour pricing
  although sardine has been one of my favorite madison restaurants since they opened i thought i would write a quick review on my recent dinner there i suggested sardine for our board of directors dinner on a recent wednesday night and it was a unanimous hit we had a table of 12 many of whom were from out of town and or had never been to sardine it was much busier than i would have expected for mid week but the atmosphere was wonderful not too loud to have a conversation but lively the staff at sardine are some of the best in madison and they lived up to that on this evening every person at our table raved about their meal and i never heard a single complaint or concern only positive feedback since john and phillip opened marigold kitchen more than ten years ago they have set a new standard for dining in madison and sardine continues to set the bar the greatest test of any restaurant for me is to have the confidence to bring a diverse group of people out for dinner and feel confident that whatever their taste they will enjoy their meal sardine passed the test with flying colors on this evening and i will continue to count on sardine as one of my reliable go to restaurants for any occasion
  best little mexican place in phoenix the chimis and burros and everything i have ever eaten here is amazing it s in the back of a house in the hood and is worth the trip if you re going for lunch getthere before noon to avoid the line that stretches through the neighborhood
  8 01 08 i would say h to the e to the double l to the no taste like wanna be asian food several types of choices from thai cuisine to chinese type of cuisines the sauces are very uggghhhh not that great at all there was 7 of us and i believe only one of us enjoyed their food which was a noodle soup dish i would not go here again the only thing i liked was their decor very unique but food wise be aware its yucky and it cost more than it should have been be aware of bad food
  eh i almost want to give this a 1 star the only thing preventing the downgrade is the fact that it was warm out and i wanted a cold margarita and they delivered and it was half price if i had to pay full price for that margarita and for my fajita wrap that was mainly lettuce and bland chedder cheese i d have gone with the 1 star for sure i went here with a group of women if it wasn t a work event i wouldn t have even gone i heard miserable things about this place and i should have listened save your money go to a local independent mexican restaurant skip this adventure for better more flavorful and adventurous dishes if i wanted crappy mexican southwest food i d have gone to chili s
  finally went my mother was craving a chili dog while we were out one day so we decided to go for lunch i wish that i enjoyed it as much as most other people seem to food wasn t what i thought that it would be i thought that the hot dogs were okay nothing special and not worth the price i ve had better from the grocery store and cooked on the grill at home my mother didn t like the chili and i didn t care for the sauerkraut that i had on my bratwurst the onion rings were decent though the decor is cute and makes you feel like you ve been pulled back in time and out east now this is where the big problem starts the service is just horrible i encountered four different people working there and only one smiled another asked me what i wanted and then snapped at me for ordering incorrectly like i know how you re supposed to order at a place that i ve never been to and the last girl was breaking all kinds of health code violations seeing her play with her hair and drinking her personal drinks with her gloves on and then touching food disgusted me maybe that played a role in why i didn t think the food tasted that great because of the people who were handling it i threw out most of my food honestly i m usually willing to give a place a second chance if i have an off first visit but i honestly don t ever see myself going back to ted s gross
  i moved recently to pittsburgh and i m a huge fan of the iskander i tried one the downtown and it wasn t good i saw this restaurant in yelp and i thought i ll give it a try the iskander and the kunafa is the bomb you really should try them both absolutely coming back
  not my type of crowd by the time we got our food their were salt shakers being throw from another table getting into a argument not us patrick the server was of his a game but that s about it
  great service and great italian food we are so happy to have found this place the mussels in white sauce are awesome the bottle of capezzana red blend was a great suggestion for our meal we felt right at home thanks to the owner and servers and we will be back soon to sample the other menu options
  i have been here multiple times and although the happy hour menu is great with multiple drink and food items the service during happy hour can be very slow it took approximately 15 20 minutes before our waitress came to ask us our order i do not know if she was on break and no one was covering her tables or if she just was not paying attention the manager at the time did allow our group to move tables around to fit our large group together which was very nice despite the slow service i will of course be back especially to try more of the new food and drink options for happy hour
  it s no wonder this place is always crowded i love the food here great place to come for breakfast on the weekends if you don t wanna wait for a table come early
  i live around the corner and have been here a few times went on a wed night around 7pm it was a bit of a senior citizens convention i guess it is the over 50 hot spot that said the food is very tasty we had a nice booth comfy and quiet enough to have a conversation but loud enough to provide privacy we started with the spinach dip it was not your average dip typically they are very creamy this had a bit more texture i found it really tasty it was not my wifes favorite so i filled up on it i had the bacon cheeseburger entre and after the spinach dip i was to full to finish half the onion strings were tasty and the burger was cooked well my favorite was the double decker cheesecake chocolate and vanilla with chocolate and raspberry sauce it was awesome def my favorite part of the meal
  being from around detroit i can never get enough of these hot dogs they are amazing it s like being home again i will never come to las vegas without coming here to eat one of these or two or three love how it s in old vegas and they taste the same as they do back home
  been there twice i remembered liking the food but the second visit i had the breakfast burrito and coffee their espresso machine was broken that day i left with a stomach ache the coffee was terrible and the burrito was yuck if you go stick to the standards but in my opinion not worth the wait
  lovely views and great music and dancing the food was so so prices are good at happy hour
  great dilworth south end spot whether you grab a spot inside of out it is a fun place to be for lunch or dinner the bbq is great as are the sauces and sides portions are huge too don t be embarrassed for going with the little pig great beer selection and you can even get a 24oz sammy smith for 4 bucks got a few big plasmas to watch the game too a must for anyone in charlotte for any length of time
  pretty laid back place i don t eat burger but my partner does so we went to this place by the outlet mall and their smash fries are outstanding they actually taste like chips the hamburger meat doesn t come out of a freezer and you can taste it yes i had to have a bite the only thing it s a little pricy specially when you have to basically wait your own food there s only one cashier and you pick up your order from a window that s connected to the main kitchen
  the only good thing about this place was the mangolian grill food and service were just okay got ripped off on the travelzoo offer the offer said it was a discounted price so we purchased it same offer was at the door lame will never go back and will never recommend this place to anyone there are better buffets in vegas
  i personally love eating at authentic foreign restaurants mediterranean food has become my new favorite last month i was on a japanese cake eating ramen noodles anywhere i can find this month i am all over mediterranean food this is my second time visiting this restaurant and both times i ve been highly impressed by the quality of the food and the amazing flavors not to forget the staff who are friendly attentive and accommodating
  vacation bias alert so i was in vegas with some friends and we were craving dim sum we hopped in a taxi to the gold coast not the golden nugget thank you to my fellow yelpers for the correction quality seemed good to me maybe i was being biased because i was on vacation but i ve eaten enough dim sum over the years to be happy with this place
  great salad bar with the option to self pay they probably lose money with hungry salad bar patrons and the quality of items they have available cajun mix hummus fruit salad are some of the notable items i always get the salad bar but i also like getting the excellent southwest chicken chili the club is great too never had anything i didn t love here
  we now have the real deal for great italian food right in our backyard of las sendas yippeee
  i was so sad the day my mom texted me and told me fusion closed i live in tucson and every time i came up to scottsdale fusion was a mandatory stop they had the best beef tataki
  absolutely phenomenal establishment all seven of us were extremely impressed by both the food and service i got the special filet with vegetables and it was the 2nd or 3rd best piece of beef i ve ever had another had lamb and claimed it was spectacular the bread and butter were even extraordinary wine list was impressive only thing is sinatra theme really wasn t that strong just a couple of pictures on the walls really business casual dress although some in other parties wore jeans with nice shirts i d sell my children for medical experiments to eat here again
  service was fast and food was great good bbq flavor and sizable portions full bar with a nice row of tap atmosphere was casual and easy
  it was an interesting evening it does have great ambience bartenders ladies were not very friendly they did their job not saying they were bad just not fun when you normally visit a place food was good a bit pricey happy hour wine was priced very well introduced myself as a concierge and believe me we can or not send a lot of people to restaurant venues and manager could have cared less it was an ok evening but not at the top of my list we were at flemings on monday and it was a lot nicer
  went to mortons for my birthday great place if you like to eat red meat which i dont i had the lamb chops and veggies food was excellent price was a little on the high side the whole food presentation and service really didn t justify anything for me although it is really nice inside and the valet service was a bonus
  one of the best restaurants in pittsburgh came here with a colleague for dinner and sat at the bar ordered a number of courses and all the food was delicious i also have to say from the host hostess to the bartenders to the servers everyone went out of their way to provide exceptional service hands down one of the best dining experiences in pittsburgh i will definitely be back often
  located at the citycenter crystals shopping complex cucina by wolfgang puck caters to your drinking and food needs when i arrived i wanted to cry i had myvegas loyalty points i could have used up here got the white wine sangria it turned out to be the best drink i had all vacation it has fruit slices it brings white wine and makes it sweet omg it tastes really good and it still has the alcohol taste in there i think it was during happy hour so i got a dollar or two knocked off its price i don t think i would have enjoyed the red wine sangria as much though friendly service and friendly bar service as well d
  great beers and ambiance we had such high hopes for the food after reading the menu but were disappointed we ordered the mussels and clams in the white wine broth not quite sure if there was any white wine in there it tasted like the lipton onion soup and nothing more the liberty fondue was okay the balsamic vinaigrette drizzle was a nice touch but the cheese was just warm and hardening the presentation for chopped salad was terrific but again it lacked flavor
  food was amazing and the staff was on point they recommended food that was exactly what we were looking for and it all came out in a timely manner i will be back
  i ve been eating here for years off and on i used to live close by and went often the quality of the food started to go down and we stopped going then they changed owners and it s ok to eat there again flamingo palace is just what you d expect from a strip mall chinese restaurant the food is so so and the service is pretty good we really like the hot and sour soup and the flamingo chicken i can say that through the many many times that i ve been to flamingo i ve never had an experience that made me not want to come back
  what a pretty place with a view i took my french born mother here for lunch on friday she enjoyed the crab louie salad with a generous portion of avocado i had the moules mussels appetizer basically with no frites prices were reasonable the juices from the mussels white wine butter italian parsley goodness were sopped up with the bread brought to the table service was great i would love to return for dinner and wine eyeing the foie gras appetizer and the beet salad they also have beef tartare on the menu which always sounds good to me
  the worst did not get what we ordered they charge you drink refills and no restroom in a resteraunt really awful i do not recommend to anyone save your time and money
  incredible we called ahead to order for pick up because we wanted a night in but were feeling too lazy to cook we ordered the meat and cheese pork sage sausage and cheeses with red wine sauce and the peppered steak with stilton and roasted veggies with peppercorn brandy cream sauce oh my gosh so good so good that the next day int he middle of my work day i felt compelled to look them up on yelp and give them a big thumbs up the sausage was amazing a generous amount of fragrant and flavorful sage yum the peppered steak had just the right amount of silton to be utter perfection we were worried about ordering that one because it is easy to overdo it with such a strong cheese but they totally have it down for dessert boyfriend ordered the banoffee pie which he loved i did not like it because it was a lot of graham cracker crust if you like graham cracker crust this pie would be perfect for you the caramel and cream and bananas together were heavenly by far the crown jewel of the meal was my strawberry pavolva it is made in a crisp meringue shell with fresh whipped cream and fruit it was to die for so so good the texture was incredible it is definitely big enough to share but i m not sure you will want to
  i wish you could give half stars i would say a 3 5 i ll start off with the line it was not that long but it took along time for it to move almost 15 minutes for me to get seated but that s because i was a party of one and got to sit at the bar or else i would have been there way longer i didn t expect it to take long since i was seated at 11 45pm on a saturday it was quick to order and get my drink since of course i was sitting right at the bar but it was really long before i got my burger i sat there for almost 45 minutes because i had to meet someone at 12 30pm and i got it right at that time luckily they were running late too so i had time to enjoy my food in the restaurant during the wait though the staff at the bar kept telling me that it will be out any minute and kept saying sorry for the wait which i find nice because they are at least acknowledging that it is taking a fairly long time i thought the food was great i had the hell s kitchen burger and it had a great kick because i like spicy foods it really did satisfy my late night hunger and i was super happy with what i picked and maybe worth the wait but i still felt it was a super long time to get i would say overall what brought up this place to so many stars was the food i felt the service was okay at best but not good by any means
  love the selection of sushi they have very different types than i am used to but also some originals always leave the place full and for a great price always check groupon before you head over they often have a deal
  my east coast savvy friends have raved about shake shack for a while so needless to say i was very excited to try it out upon arriving to vegas this weekend and boy it did not disappoint can t wait to have it again for a friday afternoon in vegas the wait for shake shack was not as busy as one would think but it was still very packed in the seating areas we were in line to order for about 10 minutes and were able to find a table and retrieve our food in about 15 while in line the staffmember was very helpful with familiarizing us with the menu and even playfully invited us to compare the experience with in n out which i will get to later food our party ordered a number of yummy menu items savory 1 shackburger has lettuce tomato and shack sauce and is possibly the most comparable to an in n out cheeseburger the patty is mindblowingly delicious i miss it already 2 smokeshack a unique burger that features shake shack s signature red peppers any burger with bacon gets an a and this is no exception 3 cheese fries crinkle cut fries topped with a special creamy american and cheddar cheese sauce tip ask for bacon and red peppers on top sweet 1 neapolitan shake my love asked for a combination of the strawberry chocolate and vanilla frozen custards and they gladly complied possibly the best neapolitan shake i ve tried 2 blueberry concrete flavor of the week a concrete is a more dense version of the shake think mcflurry s from mcdonald s but 10x better this concrete had blueberries mixed in and it was wonderful 3 highly recommended shack attack concrete by far one of the best chocolate desserts i ve ever ordered this concrete was creamy chocolatey and filled with plenty of delicious mix ins such as sprinkles dark chocolate chunks and chocolate truffle cookie dough the verdict shake shack vs in n out after discussing it with my friends post meal i have decided that the two burger chains do not invite comparison with one another bc they re in entirely different elite leagues sorry if that s not what you want to hear while their menus seem similar and their burgers are similar sizes size their offerings quality and taste are both on another level as a born and raised socal girl my heart will forever love in n out there s nothing like a classic 3 hamburger protein style with animal style fries and a chocolate shake but their desserts do not hold a candle to shake shack s epic frozen treats menu shake shack admittedly has a more extensive menu so their prices do not compare to in n out s affordable menu overall head to shake shack for more menu options and great flavor and taste but if you re looking for simple classic and tasty options for the best value then in n out is the way to go
  opening day and it lived up to the oreganos we know and love great food great service
  le village buffet offers all things french macaroons till monday baguettes galore and seafood heaven this buffet will have you screaming for more i love the seating it s very disney like specifically pirates of the caribbean the restaurant wonderful service they re very friendly hard working and attentive i recommend seating in one of the little rooms just ask your host if you can sit in one they ll usually seat you unless it s completely full for breakfast arrive early i m talking about 9 9 30am on a weekday probably 8 30am on a weekend or a holiday we arrived at 9 50 and got seated by 10 20 and the line just kept building up the crepes are ok they get ya by having them made in front of you but that s where it ends the sausage selection on the other hand is game they have at least 10 different sausages to choose from also you have to try the potatoes and corned beef their breakfast is really really good for dinner arrive early we came by at 6pm on a weekday and there was practically no line the struggle was real we were trying so hard not to over eat because everything was so good i loved the seafood pretty basic and all the desserts also had an arnold palmer which was a really nice touch to our meal overall a fantastic buffet we had the 24 hour pass which was around 60 after tax it basically gives you access to a few buffets and lets you use it up to five times in a 24 hour period since we were staying at planet hollywood we mostly just went to spice market and le village both are really great buffets and a more economical approach to dining in las vegas
  this place is right down the street from us and we were looking for something quick and easy for dinner the owner and staff are super friendly we had our 5 year old with us so they gave her a paper plate to draw on which they later hung up on the wall and the chalkboard table was open so she was entertained with that as well as watching the gentleman behind the window tossing and making the braided crust pizza was delicious as was the beer in the chilled mason jar mugs we ll definitely be back
  we really liked this place a lot we were introduced to it via the culinary food event devoured short leash dogs stood out amongst incredible contenders so that inspired the 22 mile trip for a hot dog we started with the fried pickles they were good and unique but i was satisfied after two or three and there was a big basket for 6 i ordered the oliver with a spicy beer hot dog when i picked it up water literally ran out of it for lets say 20 seconds too late my naan was now soggy clearly no one even attempted to drain the sauerkraut the taste was there and the salad was exceptional partner had the moki that was divinity wrapped up in a naan what a crazy good combo of deliciousness on a spicy dog we would definitely order this puppy again with a salad the chips were boring so we drove 22 miles spent 42 on hot dogs with two delicious tap beers and tip and will do it again the restaurant is darling and funky
  this this is what coffee shops are supposed to look like at least in my opinion i ve never walked into a coffee shop until sunrise and there s shelves of books to read at your pleasure books of all kind non fiction fiction do it yourself educational coffee shops have a staple for being the place to go to become enlightened informed nerdy i was immediately fascinated by this when i was waiting for my nutella frapuccino wait nutella frapuccino oh yes might i add this is a genius coffee with the best of both worlds i don t believe every single item is of an organic and vegan quality obviously creamers and milk aren t of vegan quality but i love their outlook on presenting the best cup of coffee or tea in the most sustainable manner possible i guess when you re already a tree hugger you might get giddy about that but seriously it was more so the allure of the shop itself with its shelves of alluring books that drew me in more than the taste and this isn t saying the taste was bad it was really delicious the tastes of coffee and teas here will appeal to your taste buds different because yes they use quality ingredients that aren t processed or haven t been loaded down with other preservatives or extra sugars like some other yelpers noted it s important to keep an open mind when crossing over from your local starbucks into an organic vegan certified coffee shop
  i can t stay to study here due to their bad internet connection i ve always in need of good connection to search for the references i need for my writing paper but this place is to enjoy a cup of good coffee and to hang out and meet with friends also fresh madison market often gives some coupons at the back of their receipt so yeah don t waste it take it and make use of it and steep brew is one of the stores that actively participates nice of them the barista never gave me a dirty look for any coupon i brought to them and their motto saying we ice anything is one good news for summer
  i got the quesadilla with shrimp and mango unique combination but nonetheless good try it i d recommend this place i was only in glendale for one day because i was interviewing at midwestern university i just decided to stop somewhere for dinner the night before the interview i saw this place and hoped it was good and it was i kinda wanted to try a regular burrito but someone else on yelp said to try the shrimp mango quesadilla so that s what i did the place was kinda empty during dinner time i don t really know what that means but it doesn t seem good
  worse parking ever the place is always way too crowded overpriced for what you get and they need better live music everyone brags about their bbq well when i get it there it always tougher than shoe leather and they take forever to get a drink order
  i love jimmy buffet and i had a blast at the margaritaville in key west but this place is just not worth the headache it is packed all day long and probably seats 1000 people we shared some apps wings were horrible horrible the service was a complete mess sorry jimmy i ll have to wait till i m in key west for another cheeseburger in paradise
  3 star average for my beloved zaba s say it ain t so i had to scan through all the reviews to get myself prepared to battle and defend zaba s honor but you know what i know where most of them are coming from this location just opened in april and even i the most diehard of zaba s fans since i ve been visiting their establishments since i was a unlv student over 15 years ago can admit that i had some shaky experiences here early on i think a few times that month after they opened i literally drove across town to the next nearest zaba s to get my fix i m happy to report that half a year later everything is fine and well now the shredded beef is consistently seasoned to my liking a problem early on and some of the newer staff members then were a little light handed on portions and have since come around to providing more bang for the buck my usual order is a shredded beef salad with corn and green salsa but on the weekends i splurge a little with burritos or tacos and sour cream and cheese and chips okay so i always get chips i find myself not getting the chicken at this location as much as i used to get it at some of the other ones i tend to like it when it gets a nice seasoned char and more often than not here it doesn t look like it has that nice burnt exterior i m a charred chicken connoisseur i ll be honest though i find myself not being upset at the chicken because deep down my heart lies with the shredded beef anyway i like chipotle s barbacoa but find zaba s version usually superior especially when it s seasoned well which as of late it has been then the green salsa here is better than any chipotle offers imo my only 2 disappointments are as follows 1 the chips are tasty but i feel like there s never enough salt on them here finding a salty chip in a bag here sometimes is as difficult as finding meaningful lyrics in a justin bieber song 2 coca cola freestyle people it s 2015 this isn t a thing anymore but i swear every 5 or 6 visits i get someone who stares at it in amazement like it s a portal to narnia or you get someone who has to examine every option of flavor of diet coke zero before settling on regular clearly barqs dr pepper or cherry coke are the only acceptable options anyhow i ve given it praise before but let my close out this review by telling you how much i love the zip program they do here for every 10 entrees you purchase you get a free one the best part is double point sundays so if you make it a point to come in sunday and order say 2 entrees you re 40 of the way to a free entree i come here so much i average a free entree every week and a half another win for the common man
  as you can see by the overall rating on this restaurant you should avoid i have been twice the first time was much better than the first the first time i went with a party of 7 and we sat at a round table had apps dinner and drinks and everything was fine and service was good the second time i made a reservation 3 weeks ahead of time since it was a large party after my graduation my family came from out of town about 20 people when we got there they told us we would be at two separate tables even though when i made the reservation they said that we would all be seated together not only were we separated but instead of connecting two long rectangular tables they had about 15 of us at a long table and my mom and grandma and 3 others at a circular table across the room i was pretty mad about that had i known it wouldve been like that i never would have went anyway the food and service was also awful we had to flag servers down and no one of the twenty people were impressed with their food in fact my dad had to buy food right after we left because he didnt eat anything the whole experience was really disappointing especially when youre paying so much for bad food and service never ever again listen to the reviews and go elsewhere
  so disappointed i ordered a pizza and garlic knots and it is so bad my wife and i couldn t eat it and had to order from a different restaurant the garlic knots were burned to a crisp and the pizza haf practically no toppings while the middle of the pizza was almost raw and stuck to the box we honestly had to rip out little pieces to get it out we will never order from this place again when calling in to let them know what was going on they hung up on me but not before yelling at each other while i could hear everything they said then the person i spoke to when i called back said they couldn t do anything for me and said i would have to wait until an owner came in and that she would have them call me just bad business not sure why they have 5 stars looks like more friends and family ratings
  this local gilbert establishment has never disappointed me over the past five years i have been going there my wife and i will stop there on a weekend afternoon for lunch and always walk away happy i like to try something different whenever i go and always enjoy what i have the staff are always friendly the food is always good and i am supporting a local restaurant it doesn t get much better than that i love the french fries they are seasoned really well the lemonade is homemade and very good yeah flancers p s they opened a second location in north mesa 1902 n higley rd
  im not religious but oh jesus thank you screw this review im going to eat p s dont forget to call ahead and everything on the menu is good
  4 20 cafe makes the best mochas in quite possibly the world they use valrhona chocolate and it s one of the most delicious hot beverages i ve ever had their dishes are pretty well portioned so you don t feel gorged after brunch unless you end up ordering multiple plates to share because you can t decide on what you want to eat i have loved everything i ve tried here i m a huge fan of their biscuits especially with the sausage gravy their yogurt and granola is great the bread for their sandwiches is wonderful i love how they use local ingredients too i was so excited the first time i went here and saw that they were using veggies from butterbean farms the staff is friendly here too the cafe is adorable seating is sometimes difficult but don t be scared to cozy up and share a table with strangers so you can sit down and enjoy your meal this place is one of my favorite brunch spots
  got a seafood pho soup with rice noodles it was tasty but they were really stingy on the meat for the prices they are charging
  brunch is awesome i ve been to corbin s for brunch several times but never for just dinner so my boyfriend and i decided to try it out we had a 10 off one entree from the valpak we went on a wednesday night there was no one eating in the dining area and just a few people at the bar and sitting outside we had ordered our food and a glass of wine and beer well we saw the two tables outside that ordered after us receive their appetizers fine and then their meals where was ours our waiter finally came by and said it was almost ready we ordered the pan fried chicken and salmon which you wouldn t think would take very long well 20 minutes after we were told it was almost done the food finally comes out we waited for at least 45 minutes for our food and the waiter didn t even offer an excuse as to why it took so long the chicken was good but asparagus had no seasonings and the hard ends were not cut off my boyfriend said the salmon and side of veggies had no flavor whatsoever he makes better thank goodness they served it with a lemon we were very disappointed with the wait and the food we will only be back again for brunch i still can t figure out why it took so long and why we weren t given a reason also each dish was 17 not worth the price sorry corbin s but had to share my experience
  this is a great small place and really unbeatable prices if you like to try a bit of everything as other posters here have mentioned they have a vegetarian thali and meat thali for around 9 00 and you get either all vegetarian choices or 2 meat 1 vegetarian option comes with naan rice papadam bread i love their butter chicken and chicken curry but the last few times it was a bit lacking in flavour i think it s just not as consistent but that being said i am rarely disappointed great place for take out and if you aren t looking for a thali special their menu actually has some great options as well i love their chana samosa
  there are some really fun fusion food options like kalbi beef kimchee quesadillas and philly cheesesteak egg rolls you can order a side of bulls balls an alcohol infused shakes like the drunken monkey and pick up strippers at the bar or club right outside the restaurant what more do you need in vegas
  the wings are really good we have ordered them twice now we got the hot option and the sauce is flavorful and just spicy enough to make you sweat a little they use the good size wings and drumsticks not those little wing dings some places like to call wings we have only ordered pizza there once it was okay not the best but certainly better than some of the other places we ve tried around here
  i m not a fan of toby keith or even a cowboy well i m a cfh but thats besides the point this place is tolerable i have gone here a couple times either before or after a movie at the cinemark theatre and the beer was reasonably priced i believe i paid 3 bones for a pint of sierra nevada or some kind of pale ale didn t have any food so can t help anyone out there they atmosphere is relaxed with a huge bar circular bar right in the middle on the west side of the bar is the area where you can sit down at a table or booth and have lunch or dinner i saw a reatil store selling everything toby kieth then over to the east part of the bar there is a stage and a couple of barn looking things with some couches and comfy chairs inside that i lounged on for a couple of minutes they also had a lush looking room behind some glass that looked like it can be used for meetings or private partys even have a mechanical bull but that seems to be the new trend everywhere these days ok so what i didn t like about this place its rather bright in their granted the times i ve been here have been during the daytime the bartender chick acted like she was all that and wasn t really all that also she came off like we were interupting her like it was inconvinience to serve us and do her job lastly all they played was shit kicker music now i know its a country place but it even sounded like it was the same artist every song so i started thinking all the played was toby s music i went up to the hostess and asked her if all they played was toby keith s music she enlightned me that was not true but they played the same playlist over and over again all day long when asked how many times a day would she hear the same song she told me about 8 to 9 times thats almost inhumane torture and felt sad and sorry for those employees i know i wouldn t be able to stomach that day in and day out so overall if you dig country and that kinda lifestyle then you will go ape shit for this place but if you don t its still adaquate
  its a cool spot to go nothing outstanding only been here once since it changed from midtown sundries i ll go again and may update it my review if something review worthy happends
  i ordered before and today we came to eat in and i must say this is now one of my favorite places in ndg it s just a chicken diner but they have the food down and the prices low and the service is just amazing so friendly the whole way through and what seemed like good long term clientele we both had soup breast chicken dinners w coleslaw fries gravy bread and half a litre of red wine and it came to about 38 we loved it will definitely be a go to winter spot
  i like the food here and its my day drinking spot i like the brat with the pretzelbun bar staff are always friendly and take care of us i just dont know why this place is not ever busy i think it is the neighbourhood
  44 for a saturday lunch the prime rib was unbelievable inch thick and juicy every item was fresh so now i m just confused as to why a great buffet was so far off from the strip
  i was very excited to come here as it was my first time i expected a lot especially for the price for burgers the menu is huge that s not a good thing in my opinion it was too overwhelming took us a while to go through it i found it odd we weren t given waters at the beginning doesn t every place usually do that our drinks came out at a decent time though the waiter told us the kitchen was backed up so we asked for fries while we waited for our food never got them okay i ordered my burger medium well it was completely burnt charred i got the a1 peppercorn burger i guess i expected it to taste like the sauce i was wrong i had to take the top bun off to eat it because the bad taste was so strong then the waiter asks my friend who i went with if he needs anything or wants new fries we both got bottomless he never acknowledged me at all seriously i felt like it was sexism in all honesty even my friend pointed out that he was being helped asked questions but not me it took a while to split the check so i wish that would ve been acknowledged from the beginning we should ve spoke up told him the waiter was talking to my friend about how he has been a server for over ten years now so i guess i just expected better service won t be coming back got to cross that off my list
  the only good things i can say about la cave is the service staff and atmosphere the food was not that great the beets with goat cheese was not bad at all but the seafood we tried was sub par the salmon sashimi tostadas was not sashimi but smoked salmon and it tasted funny because it just don t go together with the sauce they serve i wonder if they ran out of sashimi and just put smoked salmon and hoped we wouldn t notice maybe an error in the kitchen i don t know our white sangria was actually wine spritzer with 3 pieces of fresh fruit in it they charge 15 for that come on guys nice crowd nice atmosphere and good vibe good service but the food was just not good they need to try a little harder
  i love pesto s and frequent here often i love that its locally owned quality food and has great decor happy hour is a great deal too my favorite dish is the eggplant rollatini chefs specials are amazing too twice the owner gave me a carnation on my way out great family running this place
  very good skillets the service was also great but could have used an area to wait while we were waiting to be seated a small but comfortable breakfast place
  hanny s is so much fun it s swanky and has its own dj if you re looking for a fun place to go with friends for drinks yummy food and a cool ambiance this is it
  took my wife to over easy for breakfast and what an experience it was our first time and while trying to decide on what to order my wife saw the lady s plate setting next to us and asked her what she had ordered because it looked so delicious low and behold after speaking to lady for several minutes we realized it was one if the owners andrea or andy she was so engaging and a very nice woman my wife ordered the pumpkin french toast with a mediterranean omlet i had the denver omlet and a belgian waffle we also had an order of the blueberry muffins omg everything was so fresh the muffins were so gooey and has so many blueberries yummy the omlets were awesome mine had so many fresh vegetables it was yummy the pumpkin french toast was freshly made and yummy the waffle was good but the maple syrup made them yummy everything was amazing from the fact that the owner was there and took the time to talk with us made us feel welcomed and like part of the family highly recommend it we got there early and the place filled up pretty quick but that should be expected due to the entire experience will definitely go back this place rocks food service hospitality 100 it was yummy
  the worst food food came to table brunt the service was slow even tho the place was empty save your money
  went to the grand opening in summerlin the food service atmosphere was spectacular it s always a treat when you can enjoy great restaurants off the strip the grand opening was a success moving forward it was obvious the next time i will have to make a reservation great job
  old el paso tamales took me back to my mothers homemade tamales highly recommend stopping by and getting your tamale craving filled
  excellent food and great atmosphere the people were awesome and recommended food we never heard of
  this place is unfortunately often overlooked probably due to insufficient marketing the place has a cool pre retro as in forties or fifties feel it s kind of lush or was lush and i can t determine whether the decidedly worn tired feel adds to the appeal of this place to me anyway this is not a bad place to hang out but it wouldn t be the highlight of a night out in downtown phoenix i have to say that we got great attentive service with exactly zero attitude and that is a large part of why i am giving this place four stars you d probably want to start here rather than end up here but all in all ghost lounge will definitely be on my next downtown bar hop
  the prices are awesome the food is delicious i would definitely take a girl here for a date
  my wife and i stopped in on a friday night the parking lot was packed but they also share the lot with a chili s we were told the wait would be about 10 minutes which it was like an earlier review the female servers were in skimpy tight black dresses something like you would see in a chain breastaurant tacky we sat at the bar for our wait and was acknowledged by the bartender right away and were served our drinks quickly some of the wall art reminded me of posters i used to have as a teen in the 80s time to enter this century folks after sitting our server matt was professional as professional can be because this was our first visit he explained to us how the different cuts of meat were prepared and would taste upon seating we were given a fresh roll of bread it had a grainy taste but maybe that was the intent and that was the only roll we ever saw the fried calamari was good as were the dipping sauces i had the new york strip and garlic mashed potatoes the plate also came with a few roasted green beans and red and yellow pepper slices the garlic mashed potatoes were a little thin meaning kind of soupy but tasted well enough surprising for a steak place my serrated knife was dull i switched out my knife with my wife s whose wasn t much sharper i struggled cutting through the sinews of my steak all in all it was good service the food tasted good enough but with the dated wall decor and breastaurant style uniforms the 75 tab for the two of us seems well overpriced
  mama mi what s not to like
  my boyfriend and i really like their happy hour menu they have several vegetarian options which is a nice change we normally get the lettuce wraps gardein wings get the asian sauce not the buffalo sauce and then a few other random things they have an amazing taps selection and you can get really small portions so that you can try a bunch of different types it s got a slight upscale pub feel to it i really like this place i just wish there were a location closer to downtown phoenix
  exquisite they apparently have a limo service that takes you from the hotel to the restaurant another chef s tasting very french very lovely everything from foie and tuna and beef tartare and john dory and caprese and jellyfish and veal and godly bread carts
  i ve seen posts about this place so my husband and i decided to try it out we started off with the octopus ball which was ok for me it wasn t something i d try again but my husband said it was good we wanted to order the salmon sashimi appetizer but the waitress said it was a new item and wasn t sure if they had any bummer my husband and i shared the seafood hot pot and added sliced beef quail eggs and extra cabbage the hot pot was good but i wish they added more flavor to it the waitress also gave us 3 pieces of their chicken meatball which was delicious i thought that was the best part of the meal
  this place is amazing they have the best burgers and the best prices when you eat here a 5 00 burger with fries and a drink cost you exactly that 5 00 the friendliest people work and eat here too fun atmosphere too
  great place for beginners or experts cool place to hang out play and just enjoy time with friends food service though needs work very slow and the food isn t that good
  stopped here for breakfast this morning and was totally satisfied i got the colorado omelet and raspberry pancakes and service was good good for a family breakfast
  i am not a fan of noise too close for comfort seating or tables that are too small to comfortably have drinks and entrees on the table the menu is not for the faint hearted brains pig ears etc the huge pork chop is very good and definitely enough to share as a full entree the waiter knew we wanted to share the pork chop and order other sides didn t offer to have the double pork chop de boned and cut in half in the kitchen not one of my finest culinary moments trying to make into 2 portions on the tiny table do not go there if you have theater tickets we had 5 45 reservations and ran over to the benedum for a 7 30 show there are much quieter better restaurants in the theater district
  this is really a 3 5 in my book the space is pretty big and they have both indoor and outdoor seating they have free wifi and on a saturday morning it is very quiet and a great place to work the morning torque protein shake seriously one of the most delicious things ever if i got to drink one of these every time i worked out i think i would work out way more the cali wrap for breakfast was pretty standard there was a lot of wrap compared to inside goodies
  am not a poutine person everywhere i go they don t do it well but when i was in montreal and saw this poutine place and i heard that montreal has the best poutine so i decide to try it and it was really really really good poutine the best i ve ever had this place is a must either you like poutine or not because they do it in a perfect way and they have a lot of options you can choose from so defiantly you will find something you like in their menu price is perfect portion is more than perfect service is great and friendly
  be prepared to spend a lot of money here the crispy duck salad was good but i m not sure how it s worth 28 service was a bit slow and our server was absent for 15 minutes while we were ready to cash out and leave i like the idea of family style asian fusion and sharing plates so there s one benefit probably won t be back here anytime soon
  pros location for me anyway staying at planet hollywood the waitresses cheerleader uniforms it s a sports bar called blondies i m allowed to be a chauvinist pig some tables had personal beer taps unfortunately i didn t get to take advantage of this menu selection was pretty good a little something for everyone they burnt our first pizza a little definitely still edible but still gave us a 2nd pizza for free cons the burnt our pizza but made up for it i got a wrap that was pretty good but i ve had better value was just meh probably decent for vegas though with all the places to go in vegas blondies is likely not a priority destination but it was good for a weekday lunch and some beers
  disappointed pot roast dry mac cheese is out of a kraft box clam chowder tasteless service awful server not rude she took our order brought our food gave us our chk nothing more even though we sat near a main aisle where she passed ever few mins she never asked how things were how we were doing she didn t even refill our drinks there s a flip menu on the table saying u get a free dessert if a dessert tray isn t brought to u i have never turned down a free offer this time i did i couldn t wait to leave first last visit ever
  nomsss went here for lunch with my whole family they have generous portions got the lunch special that comes with salad miso soup an entree and a roll i had to take things home i was extremely full the ramen is delicious extremely savory and salty though so make sure you enjoy that the rolls are yummy pretty americanized but still good recommend for lunch such a great deal with a great selection however the hostess can definitely work on her friendliness and politeness super super rude
  bleh sorry denny s but i m not a fan the food is awful more times than not so is the service i only came here two times for breakfast because the other nearby restaurants had a wait and i was starving but next time i think i d rather start gnawing on my own arm
  a nice treat not fancy not casual just comfortable food was excellent the appetizer was crab cakes and seafood skewers nice we had caesar prepared chopped and mixed in the dressing lobster ravioli was jammed with lobster covered in black pasta and cream sauce the sole was wonderful served with greens and garlic mashed service was average nothing special when we are in the mood and in the area we will be back we just won t drive across town so good seafood casual atmosphere average service
  we ended up coming here pretty late on evening the service was fast so that was nice when you are hungry but they were not very busy so i don t know if this is normal service for them or not i had the chili rellenos it was ok overall the rice was strange in my opinion as it had carrots it in it came with 2 stuffed peppers i could only eat 1 2 of once since i had a stomach full of frozen drinks my husband had their version of a caesar salad and said it was just ok my mom had a chimichanga and said it was greasy the chips and salsa were good and tasted fresh
  let s not get carried away with these reviews ok this isn t sept iles rein it in a little the coffee is passable the sandwiches snacks are decent and inexpensive staff is friendly beer is cold pool table in back makes it a ok do i hang out here did the desserts change my life no seems home to a lot of misfits which is a good thing as far as i m concerned maybe its the decor the big open feel and those huge windows are pretty nice but it has all of that late 1990s early 2000s boring modern feel that essentially strips it of any character rating scale 1 star avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe 2 star risky at best 3 star i ll try it again or consume here in a pinch 4 star i eat here regularly if financially and calorically feasible 5 star i m comfortable taking other chefs here
  we re on our way back from vegas but i couldn t wait till i got home to review this spot because i can t get over how bad it was we just wanted a place to grab a light lunch because we had had a huge dinner the night before we decided to go with a simple burata caprese with the margherita pizza the burata was good but the tomatoes that came with it were exactly like those canned peeled tomatoes no joke big let down then the pizza came when they first brought it to the table i said i hope it tastes better than it looks lol oh boy well the crust was thin and crispy that part was good but the sauce was i kid you not canned tomato paste soooooo awful i have been to batali s mozza in la as well as his awesome restaurant babbo in nyc so i don t get how batali could put his name on this restaurant for a 50 lunch this place was a complete waste of the money
  my 1st time here we got breakfast burritos they were excellent the place has a good vibe with bookshelves artwork etc
  walked in at about 7 30 were seated immediately but walked out at 7 43 after the group behind us who had just been sat down was being waited on when had not been acknowledged in the least no drink order no i ll be right with you nothing this was after walking into the ladies room and noticing what i believe was a homeless woman in the small restroom with her clothing spread across the baby changing table taking care of her hygiene needs
  my husband and i went on a long hike nearby and yelped for something quick and delicious when we were done i recognized reynas from man vs food so we decided to give it a try we weren t disappointed the frescos and totras were amazing perfect for after hiking we live in seattle and have nothing that compares the servers were so sweet and took great care of us the food was delivered very quickly i can t wait to return and try the ceviches we will definitely be back next time we are in town
  i have been going here since it opened i always say get the fish special the french club the arugula salad or any of the entrees i have never been a fan of the crepes with the exception of the dessert crepe wow banana ice cream and nutella colleen or catherine are my favorites colleen is one of the most talented mixologists on the planet and catherine does service to perfection this is a local place where a lot of neighbors have been going for years it is all about quality and consistency i have only left unhappy once after way too many visits and manhattans the fish and chips used to be the best in charlotte but they changed the fish a while ago and it has never been the same that is my one complaint
  pretty sure i got a free muffin and hot damn was it worth the 2 minute wait it took to get seated muffin was yummers benedict was semi yummers potatoes were yummers af i don t have a picture because the second my food was put in my vicinity my animal instincts came out and i carried out my attack all in all i would have paid for that free muffin just bc it was so dang tasty
  good was great my tummy is very happy staff was slammed so service could be better line out the door before it even opened and through our entire meal days something about the quality
  amazing food and reasonably priced for vegas you can t get better than that had the linguini carbonara and it was truly the best i ve ever had the pasta was perfectly cooked al dente this place is a hidden gem
  my girlfriend and i stopped by here for first friday we sat in the bar area so it was a great people watching spot we ordered a couple appetizers the fish tacos and the sliders i would have liked the sliders better if the bread wasn t so hard however i did like the fish taco platter as i would describe it because the ingredients came separate and you assembled the taco yourself the winner for me though was the dessert recommended by the waiter the donut churros with the chocolate sauce my only complaint would be we were told about a 2 beer special and it being warm i would think it it s the special of the night it would be ready to go cold and i wouldn t have to pour it over ice
  finally made it to hot taco after waiting in anticipation for it to be built after all the waiting i thought it was just okay margaritas were watered down chips were oily but salsa was good and had a kick to it my wife and i each had three different types of tacos with the flour tortillas i thought they were just okay and a little bland but my wife immediately threw all her food up when we got home she got food poisoning almost immediately which is too bad i really wanted to like this place
  updated review i have taken some time to step away after my experience and give what i feel is an honest critical and logical review i am trying to approach this from a logical perspective and remove any brash and quick emotional response joe beef an establishment that is beyond well regarded and coveted by many who enjoy unique dining experiences unfortunately the experience fell short for me it may have been the hype from friends the consistent and raving reviews from well respected critics and perhaps just the level of anticipation that left me looking for more we spent a week in montreal and made the rounds to the cities must do spots i ll be frank my french is beyond poor and i usually outwardly express my lack of the language for 6 nights we didn t face a single issue we were met with respect and were offered either english menus or someone well versed in the english language service is important and joe beef fell short our waiter a tall bald gentleman with forearm tattoos fell short he was quick disingenuous and it appeared he was bothered we did not speak french the menu and wine list was not covered it received a quick check it out and ask if you have any questions this is direct contradiction to the couple sitting at the bar english speaking americans who received a thorough and spirited review of the menu by the bartender i should have spoke up and asked for a new waiter that is my fault i know that these things happen the place can t be perfect all the time i m just disappointed it came on the last night of our stay after a week of nothing but perfect service we made a wine selection from the available wines by glass no complaints and a nice glass the oysters were wonderful a nice selection of west coast and pei varieties our entrees fell short my wife had the leg of lamb overall she enjoyed the dish but it lacked some depth as a dish a slab of meat with simple peas was not what we expected but it was still a decent dish i choose the lobster and spaghetti which is regarded as a classic amongst many reviewers unfortunately i found myself wanting more in the dish the lobster was cooked perfectly as was the pasta but the sauce itself was rather simple and boring i had read in the past this dish was served with a delicate lobster bisque sauce perhaps they changed this up it lacked depth flavor and added very little to the dish as a new england er i eagerly awaited this dish i wanted to see how a new city would handle a classic meal from my home as a dish it was certainly edible but i would never order it again especially at the price of 50 cad update i received a voice mail from the manager of joe beef regarding my experience and poor review here on yelp i appreciate them reaching out i ve yet to decide if i will speak to them regarding the matter unfortunately i am 5 hours from montreal and that would be quite the trip to give it another go if i find myself in montreal again i ll certainly be coming to joe beef again i ll just make sure to have a waitstaff member who delivers what they are supposed to do
  this place was great the food was delicious the service was good i had the taco and gordita with beef asado and loved it
  very good food and atmosphere every meal i ve had has been very good and the service is always quick
  the portions were large and filling and our waiter raul was attentive and fun definitely a nice spot for a local or someone who wanted to get away from the strip
  i was excited to find out this place was here especially because i live nearby and had high expectations unfortunately i was let down when we got there a couple tables were occupied by people already eating a woman and her daughter were in line ahead of us placing their order a man with three young boys was behind us we all placed our order at the counter and grabbed tables to wait for our food to be ready to pick up nobody else came in to order while we were there the woman and her daughter got their food relatively quickly i thought this was a good sign but it was not to be although the three people behind the counter seemed to be scurrying around no food was forthcoming after a long time i saw one of the people place an order of fries presumably mine on a tray under a heat lamp a few minutes later she placed another order of fries on another tray under a different lamp several minutes after that she added several sandwiches to the second tray and then she added a sandwich to the original tray with the fries that had now been sitting there a good ten minutes nothing aggravates me more than seeing my food sit under a heat lamp for an extended period of time at this point my wife went up to the pickup counter to ask what was going on they finally brought out her salad and said they d bring the dressing to the table at this point the only chance the restaurant had of having us as repeat customers was outrageously good food but things fell short my wife s salad was big had plenty of chicken and she said it was very fresh but it wasn t anything out of the ordinary i was expecting something amazing from the chicago beef considering it s the restaurant s specialty but it was just ok maybe we caught them on a bad day maybe they were buried with takeout orders maybe other menu items are outstanding and maybe my expectations were way too high regardless i was disappointed and won t be back
  some friends and i were meeting up for sushi and this place was one of the closest sushi places to their house so we decided to stop by it was fairly busy when we showed up but we were seated right away which was nice half of our party the guys were going to be showing up a little later but we went ahead and ordered some drinks and appetizers to tide us over until they showed up the waitress was nice if somewhat lacking in her knowledge of the menu but we didn t really mind after getting our appetizers and initial drinks we really didn t see our waitress well actually let me rephrase that we saw her at other tables around us just not at ours now i understand that we had told her we were going to wait to order until our party shows up so it s not like we expected her to show up and take our whole order but she wasn t even coming around to fill our water glasses or to check and see if we needed refills once the guys showed up and we ordered the food came out and i was kind of underwhelmed none of it was bad but it was all pretty average the only thing memorable were the panko breaded onion rings which were fantastic honestly i would go just for those babies as for the sushi i may try a different roll and see if that made a difference and i would definitely hope for a server who s a little more attentive
  great tacos after reading all the other reviews we thought we would give this place a try don t judge a book by its cover comes to mind when you see the storefront walking up to it we were at first skeptical that this place would have yummy tacos it looked run down and dark the tequila tacos were great fresh salsa made it pop the guac and chips were good as well freshly made chips and guac the carnitas were good as well
  definitely a unique dining experience and the food and service was very good but i m giving 4 not 5 stars based on a friends dining experience there and we missed out on a lot of cool info regarding some of the food and desserts that our server failed to tell us for example they dropped off a vegetable platter and didn t say anything about it and it turns out the different items were from all over the world would ve been cool to know what was from where
  great food i love the arepas they are all good go get some now seriously right now go eat you ll love them
  right across from my office hella dark in here i guess average looks will be super duper in this dark lit place music is great food is damn good breakfast lunch or dinner waitresses are adorable service is very quick tv s are everywhere you ll love it
  so i ve been wanting to try az 88 for awhile now and this friday this was the spot chosen for double date night yay with all the hype about this place i felt like we were in for a treat but unfortunately we all left wondering what the heck everyone is talking about as far as the restaurant itself it really is a cool place i loved the decor and i heard the bathroom was awesome from the hubs the patio and bar looked very inviting and were packed on a friday night our service was so so i didn t think our waitress was too friendly and it seemed like we were trying to cheer her up somehow it was weird also my husband was served a flat beer but she did replace it which was nice the food itself wasn t anything special i did like my az 88 chicken sandwich but everyone else wasn t impressed with what they got i found the side items that were served with the sandwiches somewhat odd cold veggies fries and some fruit basically i think i would go back just for drinks but being this is a north scottsdale bar they are quite expensive i m pretty sure i ll just save my money for some of the other awesome restaurants in the old town area
  mmmm gyro i know that zorba s isn t authentic greek food i go to chicago for that but for what it is it s excellent the service is always very friendly and speedy and they have a fairly large menu and is inexpensive they also have killians on tap and a fairly large bottle selection zorba s is probably my favorite green street eatery
  visited the brunch buffet the cost was 26 per person and i can t help but think that there must be something better my first impression was a sense of disappointment my first bite was of some sushi and it almost led to vomiting after taking a breather i was able to manage to try some other things nearly every item i tired was cold had it been hotter it all would have been decent the dessert was the only redeeming quality of this buffet i m no vegas pro but i m guessing that one might be able to do better
  cool theme curious to see if this place stays quiet or explodes in popularity it could do either with the whole beatles classic rock niche very excited to see some shows in the cavern their dark and dusty brick basement kind of creepy looking but its an awesome venue to see some music they havnt had any shows yet tried the rigby burger which was ok the meat toppings wasn t hugge by any means but the kaiser roll it was on was the size of a football a little too much bread imo the sides were the highlight in my opinion i don t like super tangy coleslaw and theirs was nice and creamy with a touch of twang overall a cool place with a decent beer selection and cheap solid food its a nice addition to madison s dynamic bar scene ill return to catch a show sometime
  i found my new favorite pho place only 5 min from home no need to go to chinatown highly recommend you all must try it s so great to have a delicious vietnamese place so close to home we will be regulars here no more pho 8 their service has gone to pot tonight i had the pho with egg noodles and roast pork the broth was piping hot tasted great the bbq pork was fantastic
  dismal is the word that comes to mind remodeled the building but obviously forgot to invest any time in training staff
  i really struggle on how many stars to give this place on the one hand there s very very few places to get ramen saimin udon and the like in the phoenix metro area i really appreciate this place as an option on the other hand republic s ramen is merely fine not amazing but fine it wouldn t pass in hawaii but lack of competition here means they ll by default get the business of ramen cravers like me their broth cannot come close to the savory complex authentic ramen i ve tried though maybe they re stretching themselves too thin with the bar and dessert boba options which i still have no idea how to order i d rather they offer a really solid ramen noodle with either a shio salt and shoyu soy broth choice or even just one absolutely amazing broth the shrimp purse happy hour appetizer was also simply fine and i wouldn t pay the normal price for it it would ve been four stars but i am taking one off for their inability to cook an egg properly everyone knows the egg should be either soft and runny to ooze it s rich golden yolk over the noodles or be made into a seasoned rolled japanese omelette tamagoyaki and sliced super thin not hard boiled don t expect a lot of customer service as they re basically operating as a fast casual chipotle type restaurant some of the tables were not cleared and wiped promptly despite employees not helping customers count me in as another person who is not a huge fan of the uncomfortable seating overall if i m in the area and hungry i ll drop by again but i really don t see myself making a special trip to this side of the valley just to eat here
  we had never tried a hungry howies until moving to the area recently we like deep dish pizza we are now fans of this place its not a gourmet sit down pizza place but its pretty darn good for fast food pizza and they deliver we like the pan pizza with butter cheese crust flavor or the garlic flavor the cheese bread is good also staff was good to us they messed up our delivery order one time and i called and they took care of our next order thats service i like and appreciate we will return
  my wife i came here for dim sum because our favorite place in mesa was so overcrowded we were hungry all dim sum items we selected at c fu gourmet were so bland i had to use a lot of soy sauce just to have some flavor gourmet should not be part of their name i don t plan to go back to this restaurant any time soon
  i love fogo my family and i went on thanksgiving while visiting vegas this was the best thanksgiving meal i ever had i am not a huge red meat fan but their meat was delicious the salad bar was excellent also the staff was friendly and always made sure we were well taken car of i plan to go to the la location next time i am craving red meat
  not the typical type of mexican food that i go for but it is good more of a commercial mexican than i generally like but the great staff has always been consistent along with the food which is what makes me fall in the four star rating
  we arrived shortly after 8 30pm to realized they closed at 9 00 no worries as they were quick to say come on in prior to our arrival we didn t know if green was a sit down or counter service upon entering we found that it would be a counter service experience nice and laid back i immediately loved the flow of the restaurant with the painted wooden tables along with tree stumps for some of the seats patio dining is available but the far end also has a see through garage door that can be opened up for open air dining too quick examination of the menu had me wanting everything it s so nice not to have to decipher which items are vegan and which ones aren t i settled on the mexicali burger however when i went to order i noticed the special the big wac what this is what everyone has been talking about in the green facebook group you see the big wac is basically the vegan version of the big mac it s not always available and absolutely everyone was raving about it i made the quick switch ordered the big wac with fries and my husband ordered the kung pao bowl did the big wac live up to the rave reviews yes and more although i admit i was never a huge burger person even prior to going veg this may be one of the best burgers i ve had in my life seriously my husband s meal was also tasty but after a nibble of my burger he immediately wished he had gone for the big wac too partnered with the yummy thin fries i had the perfect meal i can t wait to return to have another fantastic meal
  i am here late 11 pm on a friday the food here is bar food but they ve done a good job with it i made the mistake of ordering a pizza that had a lot of spice to it and they replaced it on the spot and didn t even make me ask for it they make sure you have everything you need drinks refills etc the service has been top notch the cherry on the top is the live music obadiah parker was playing and they are amazing the music was easily heard and sounded great but i could still say something to my wife without having to yell i had a great experience and will definitely return
  i cannot say enough good things about ocean trail my only complaint is that we didn t discover it sooner if you like spice and you like seafood you cannot go wrong here when you walk up to ocean trial the first time it is almost confusing and a little awkward as it is very small place and on the casino floor directly behind everyone gambling if you go on the weekends you will wait standing in a roped off line to the side but it is worth the interesting atmosphere and the wait if you are not sure what to get i must say that the pan roast is hands down the best dish ever but the crab cocktail and the shrimp boil are also amazing you really can t go wrong with anything on the menu that being said we did not enjoy the muscles however this would be the only thing on the entire menu i wouldn t recommend if you haven t been here before try it if you been here and weren t sure you fell in love try the pan roast and you will
  they changed their menu not a happy customer they used to have 3 combo lunch to choose from ramen and fried rice combo was so good now fried rice is 1 dollar extra ramen lunch combo has no chasiu absolutely no topping i can make that right at home
  met a friend here very early on a sunday morning for coffee the cashier was friendly and very helpful especially since it was our first time there she even made recommendations and provided excellent customer service i ordered an iced hazelnut coffee sweetened but no cream and also a maple bacon infused waffle the coffee and waffle were a hearty and delicious breakfast which surprised me as they were very flavorful the place has a nice coffee shop vibe music was good but not too loud and it was the perfect spot to have a conversation
  came here awhile back for a friends birthday and our whole experience was horrible staff made us feel uncomfortable and the food wasn t very good won t be coming back here
  this panda is what you would expect from panda in quality the big complaint i have here is understaffing frequently there is only one employee working the line and customers have upwards of 15 mins in wait i understand lunch rushes and that pandas have lines this one is just extraordinary in painful slowness employees are not apathetic to the speed and have come to expect this as the norm i m writing this in line only about 5 customers have been served in this time
  nice hidden gem local joint with character all our entrees were good fish and chips and cheese curds top notch good beer menu and nice wait staff will try again if in middleton
  two of us went on a sunday night just for appetizers and drinks and to check the place out i was a little worried it would be hard to find because there isn t much in southern highlands but it s well lit the only suggestion i would have is to put a sign right on pyle and decatur so that pyle is easier to find the bar was pretty full so we sat at a table server arrived right away with menus the specialty drinks all looked pretty good as far as cost they were a little more expensive than i expected but not strip prices by any means we ordered the distiller s delight and the mad mule both were tasty we also ordered the mashed potato bites and the crab bites the crab bites were a little on the pricey side but they were tasty as well the mashed potato bites were bomb i could have eaten another order of those if i had been so full our server was attentive refilled our water asked if we needed anything so no complaints there we moved to the bar after we ate as space had opened up i overheard someone complain about how smoky it was but i completely disagree there were maybe three or four people smoking in the whole place bartenders were very attentive and checked on us several times really the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars are the prices if you live in the area i would suggest you give it a go we will go back again for sure
  we tried this for the first time today for lunch we were thoroughly pleased i built my own salad that had a great variety of toppings and very fresh ingredients crisp if you will they had soups on special that were unique including cauliflower parm carrot the portions are huge the guy who took our food order was full of suggestions and knowledge while the girl who rang us up was super friendly and delivered our food to us they clean the dishes from the table great spot will be back
  truly authentic chinese food highly recommend cauliflower dish eggplant dish peking pork dumplings braised pork with egg green beans perhaps not authentic but the blueberry yam dish was interesting and quite tasty all of the above were per owner s recommendation and they were all excellent also had the spicy chicken dish which was numbingly spicy if you re into that stuff definitely a place i would recommend to others
  i keep meaning to send an email to the manager but keep forgetting we ve lived in vegas ten years now and this was probably the third happy i ever went to and loved the appetizer platter therefore have eaten here very regularly for ten years that being said the last two years or so have been absolutely horrible not sure what is going on with the management the staffing has serious issues no one is serving the bar top tables the waitresses and hostesses are aloof and rude the food and menu have now changed and are inconsistent and horrible my food tasted water logged the other day one of the new aps was inedible and i actually sent it back as i said this was my favorite meal place for ten years and also had a favorite bartender and drink this place feels like it is now relying on the drunken drug party crowd and just want to be a bar and not a restaurant the food used to be so good that i brought visitors here when they said mexican for dinner we actually stopped eating here and started eating at culinary dropout as our place of choice when in hard rock now please get it together and bring back the original happy hour menu with those potato flautas the corn cake thing and the steak skewers and quit messing with what was working the new aps are disgusting and the wait staff issue is just beyond horrible we have now walked out a few times and have been coming less and less oh and then the waitress asked us if we needed more tortillas for our fajita because it came with two dehydrated and disgusting ones so we say yes only to find a 2 dollar upcharge on our bill just ridiculous and down hill sad to lose one of my favorite restaurants for the last ten years get it together
  after a long drive to vegas my dad and i were starving we thought what the hell let s try out one of gordon ramsey s places burgr did not disappoint we were greeted kindly by 4 hosts and were sat down immediately it was shocking because it was a saturday night then i realized that it was almost midnight vegas we sat down and could not believe how low the chairs and tables were pic below our waitress greeted us with a smile took our drink orders i felt dehydrated so i ordered a water my dad on the other hand had a few black tans and obviously enjoyed them i ordered the fish crisp burger and although it took 30 minutes to arrive and was ridiculously hard to eat i really enjoyed it the cod was nicely breaded and tasted really good with the tartar sauce and onion crisps we shared the maui onion rings and could not make it through half of them because we were so full they were delicious though i will come back to try one of those gourmet milkshakes on the menu because those sounded absolutely delish
  oh god so good clearly a younger restaurant but the food is wonderful i got the waygu flank steak just a perfect steak not too salty a ton of flavor we ll be back
  i love outback they have the best cheeseburgers i know normal people go for steaks but i always get the cheeseburger they also have a drink called wild tea that is to die for
  i am a montreal native and i ve had sushi at most sushi restaurants in the city but no restaurant has been so consistently good and reasonable priced as kashima kashima has changed menus and owners several times these past few years and needless to say the prices have also gone up despite this it is still among the tastiest and freshest sushi in town i am updating my previous review and here are some comments on the sushi i had last night spicy tuna one of the best rolls fresh perfectly balanced and well proportioned so that you can actually eat it with the chop stick and it doesn t come part the tuna melts in your mouth and there is just enough mayo to make it spicy westmount with salmon tuna a solid roll a bit on the large side but thin enough so you don t make a mess while eating it flavourful its deep fried edges gives it a pleasant texture without being too oily kamikaze 3 it was just ok i remember when under a previous owner i used to have to specially request extra crispy tempura flakes because they did not put enough those days are long gone now the roll is overpacked with them making it way too large are the extra flakes being used to justify the higher prices and being put in the place of more fish montreal this roll substitutes rice with tempura flakes a less tasty version of the kamikaze in my opinion again way too much tempura not sure what purpose it serves i also didn t like that i had to use my hands to eat it and that it constantly came apart in the process i was happy overall but until those speciality rolls become better proportioned in size i m going to stick to the smaller simpler and more traditional rolls
  this place is awesome i mean 17 for all you can eat korean bbq must try the beef tongue sounds weird and crazy but it s really good and it cooks fast too squid is also delicious order the short ribs first and then dip the squid in the short ribs marinate
  came here on a friday night and sat at the bar i decided to create my own burger naturesource patty on a pretzel bun with chopped jalapeno american cheese caramelized onion jalapeno bacon chipotle aioli and button mushrooms total price came to 1million dollars it was well worth it though the burger was outstanding definitely one of the better restaurants in mandalay
  z tejas has been around forever even before i started cooking 15 years ago i remember being a punk high school kid and going to scottsdale fashion square and actually smoking on their patio that was actually inside the mall at that point in my life i had two favorite meals the tuscan lemon chicken from hoolihans and the diablo chicken pasta from z tejas sorry for being all introspective but nearly ever time i try something from my childhood that i haven t had for a long time i end up disappointed so here is my dilemma is the quality gone south or my taste buds north ug i dunno but this dish was a huge let down i remember the cotija cheese having a nice pop and the pasta being cooked perfectly this time the cheese was scant and the pasta was a mushy blob my wife says i should know better i used to think my mom s linguini was sent down by angels now ia make a fettuccini alfredo that mario battali would eat off of the floor if i dropped it its me i guess sometimes i wish i was a kid again if you still love olive garden or can t wait to go back to applebee s you will love this place if you ve moved on from your high school crushes and refined your taste buds you may just want to head in for one of their superb margaritas and eat at one of the other fabulous restaurants in the area
  authentic pakistani food must try chiken karahi barbq item you gonna love it
  this was one of those times where i walked out defiantly thinking i will not be judged yet later on when the sr asked me where was mine i had to hang my head in shame for i yer honour i did walk past and it was like a magnet pulling me in for i did indeed see me some delightful looking almond croissants let me take you back to a time when once i feasted on almond croissants in the balmy summer of the south of france i ve never tasted anything like those croissants in all my days since i left that town not that i have ever stopped trying every one i have tried has paled in comparison dry dusty overly sweet not butterly melt in the almondy mouth i m not going to lie the wee boulangerie didn t succeed either but it gave it a damn good try where most almond croissants are almond paste basted in the heart of a pastry fold and carry the body of a normal looking croissant the wee boulangerie was like a picasso impression with crispy almond sponge oozing out everywhere it didn t even really look like a croissant but it tasted light not dry not too sweet and the crispy light edges made a delightful contrast to the heaviness of the croissant itself i enjoyed every single mouthful a note as well i m on a diet almond croissants are pretty much verboten the sr is on a diet he is sick with jealousy at my hedonism i m going to have to get more to appease him thanks the wee boulangerie you destroyed my diet but in oh so such a beautiful way
  we ate here on sunday afternoon on a short stay in pittsburgh and i would definitely recommend it it s a below ground place right in a cute shopping area with a cozy warm feel it looks like it could fill up quickly but we walked right in and were able to sit at the bar to eat i had the tivoli crepe with an egg and my boyfriend had the salmon crepe which were absolutely delicious we were both members of the clean plate club within ten minutes tops full selection of sweet and more meal like crepes check it out
  after swinging by gypsy bar and lucky strike i popped into copper blues on a thursday afternoon the outdoor bar was pretty packed but the indoor bar only had two people i liked the indoor atmosphere better anyway it was dim with lounge lighting and they had the a c blasting we pulled up a couple of seats in front of alyssa at the bar she was friendly talkative and easy on the eyes the music was set at the right level to maintain conversations but kept the place lively before we knew it the bar was packed for happy hour and 1 beer shots everyone was so nice it was easy to chat it up with the other folks at the bar i didn t have time to stick around for thursday night karaoke but i will definitely be back
  our first visit and we would not be in a hurry to return went because of american airline rewards program and had heard about the place a few years ago food is nothing special lacalabria in gilbert does a much better job with better food larger portions and much better value than miele s salads are not included and house salad is 4 95 their balsamic viniagrette was basically cheap oil and some herbs and zero balsamic vinegar they had poured some balsamic and oil on a plate for dipping bread and i dumped it on my salad that was the only touch of vinegar a few cubes of cheese on top do not make a salad worth 4 95 the chicken with cheese and artichokes was so so tasted reheated not terrible but nothing i d want again i didn t know it came with a side of pasta or i would have told them to leave the heavy red sauce off so i could have enjoyed the spaghetti with the chicken s wine sauce maybe their pizza is good but i would not bother with any of the dinners on the menu after our experience service was barely adequate we had to ask for more iced tea though the server walked by our table 4 times while my glass was almost empty each time i expected him to return with the tea pitcher as happens in most restaurants he didn t notice much and the place is small and was not busy while we were there i can t imagine what happens when if it is ever busy
  attempted yesterday evening this is a smokers paradise there is no way for a non smoker to escape this appeared to be an all outdoor patio experience the bar is the centerpiece with tables in the surrounding perimeter most people at the bar were smoking and one table called my friends that were on the way and changed plans
  healthy lunch items on the menu quiches are delicious hot but not made to order can be a little pricey on the beverage side 3 5 for lattes coffee mocha or hot chocolate urban interior with cozy surroundings snuggle up to the fireplace or find a table or up top counter to plug in the computer i like the mix of people and the free wifi while sipping on a hot chai latte kiddie area outside and inside patio area in summer is nice but not shaded back room area is great for 10 15 people and can be reserved
  they have the soda fountain dispenser that let s you choose any soda fast food places can be hit or miss but this wendy s is one of the nicer ones i ve been to good job wendy s but you still need to work on those stale fries
  second visit to this restaurant and impressed with the menu for a neighborhood bar and grill this place has a very extensive menu and the best fish and chips that we have had for a long time the kitchen is very accommodating in allowing me to order off the dinner menu for lunch friendly service and one of the best parts notre dame fans we will be back
  my six word restaurant review the best indian restaurant in arizona
  i got the bottomless brunch deal however the mimosas bloody marys and sangria all lacked the correct flavor and alcohol my friends got omelettes which they enjoyed i ordered the benedict but the lobster cakes were the only good part the stuff were fabulous which help easy the blow of the horrible breakfast food
  avoid kfc at all costs the food quality is continuously horrible my food had mold on it when i called and asked to speak to a manager no one spoke english never again
  stopped by after a great lecture at asu two thai places side by side one is more of a sit down dine in place and the other where i went more of a take away although we did eat there rather small menu with the usual fare of thai food ordered the pad thai and red curry sat outside in the evening sunset which was pleasant and discussed the lecture food came in short order portions were fair sized i ordered spice hot 4 or possible 5 but it was still rather tame pad thai was ok to good it lacked fresh basil which can make the dish it had chicken and chucks of tofu which was a bit odd but i have come to find that this dish is kind of a thai chop suey whatever a place has they seem to add to the dish about the only universal is the sauce and the rice noodles a hard dish to compare to itself as the target constantly changes depending on where you order the dish my problem is that i tend to compare all thai food to that which i had in thailand and few come close to that so the scale has to be modified anyway i would go back to this place in a pinch if i wanted thai food and was in the neighborhood
  they always get the order wrong no matter how much i stress the particulars of my order just say a number and don t deviate from the menu the food is bland the place is a hot mess been there three times and always disappointed i loved this place back in sacramento here in las vegas they are just slapping beans on a plate
  let me start with the good stuff the grilled corn appetizer was delicious the server was polite at the start now on to the disappointments two of the folks in our party were brought cold entrees when they told our server her response was no they weren t as if she didn t believe us the entrees were remade and took a very long time to receive the rest of our group had finished their food by the time it came out the bill was confusing and even after the manager explained it to us it became apparent that communication is a skill they lack we had been charged for chips and salsa even though we gave our server the yelp check in incentive for free chips and salsa btw what mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa we had some bar drinks that were 5 and some that were 11 server didn t tell us about happy hour when we ordered or that some drinks would be discounted and not others we had charges for sauce even though the ladies who asked for queso instead of red or green sauce on their enchiladas weren t told it would be an additional charge and of course there was the surprise charge for extra rice for the guest who asked for only rice no beans with her meal i have never been charged so carelessly by a restaurant although the the manager did comp the two meals that came out cold this experience was so awful that i can not recommend this restaurant the icing on the cake was the booth were were seated in had dirty seats food on the floor and was situated by a high top table that two of us knocked into getting in and out of our seats don t bother trying this place it s over priced offers poor food quality isn t clean and the staff isn t trained in guest service
  i love their pizza it s one of the best i ve had in vegas the bartender keith is always pleasant and does a great job getting our food and drinks to us enjoy their selection of beer and wine great place to go have pizza i have never been disappointed
  there were 5 of us that went to the bigham yesterday for drinks and dinner the food was great i had the home made tots and mediterranean pizza both were good i favored the tots our server was awesome she had a smile on her face the whole time great personality i went to smoke outside and when i returned i had come to find out a joke they played on me my daughter told the server she was putting the ketchup and mustard bottle in my purse while it was left open then our server i wish i could remember her name asked when i returned where did my ketchup bottle go as her eyes glanced at my purse i wanted to die my face got beet red as a removed it to place back on the table while i was saying i don t know how that got in there we all had a good laugh thanks for the hospitality and going along with a funny joke love the bigham
  if you want to step back in time this is the spot to go vintage goodies all over a vintage thrift shop attached good food and great ice cream creations
  the way it was talked up i was expecting great pizza what i got was good not great it has a wide variety of options chicken wings were not bad either
  my favorite ribs in town free breakfast on the weekends awesome service what else can you ask for
  great beer selection good food fried okra is awesome good local bar lots of character ping pong and cornhole in the outdoor patio
  ummm good i love spicy asian food and thailicious was recommended to me by a friend they were so right great flavor without scorching my taste buds the service was great and the prices for lunch were great if you love thai food then this place should be on your a list and if you a member of the lunch club we will be here in october for sure
  while on a trip to vegas to experience some great food and good atmosphere union was a huge disappointment after trying a different and amazingly wonderful restaurant in aria the night before we opted to give union a shot since they had a seemingly good prix fixe menu for 49 i ordered the roasted tomato soup the organic chicken and the 7 layer chocolate cake for dessert my partner opted for the king crab and jalapeno taco the chilean sea bass and the apple pie for dessert we also chose to add the wine pairing for 20 as well when you go to a show you don t expect it to peak in the first act and that s what happened at union the appetizers were by far the best aspect of the whole experience but given that it was tomato soup and tacos it s not hard to screw those things up for the entree round my chicken was a tad overcooked and borderline rubbery the garlic spinach that came with it was great as was the tablespoon of parsnip puree that accompanied it the sea bass was equally rubbery and overcooked and a delicious sounding risotto that came with the sea bass was slightly undercooked and on the starchy side the desserts were just ok nothing special my cake was on the dry side but the apple pie was not bad i have to echo what others have said about the service it s abysmal the guy serving water was the hardest working person on the crew after we ordered we barely saw our waiter it was a revolving door of people coming by which is not unusual but our waiter rarely checked on us he dropped our wine off in the same manner as a delivery person dropping off a package i was surprised that a wine pairing didn t come with dessert especially after seeing other places in aria and other resorts offering a pairing with each course had we known that we probably would have ordered a bottle instead but the waiter didn t take the time to explain that we found out after our dessert was delivered while we were there we noticed two groups get seated and subsequently leave without being served there was plenty of staff so i m not sure what the problem was they all seemed in a constant state of chaos the atmosphere is not bad if you want something quiet and peaceful this is probably not the place since it overlooks a big bank of slot machines that constantly sing overall i would definitely not recommend this to anyone going to vegas for a culinary treat there are plenty of better options within aria and there are several other places nearby to get a much better steak if that s what you re looking for save your money and your time and treat yourself somewhere else
  barrio queen is quite possibly my favorite place in scottsdale the food is amazing the margaritas are strong the service is great and the patio is perfection we find ourselves there every month or so i always get something different the tacos are awesome but kind of on the small side i could probably eat 10 the quesadilla on happy hour is fantastic i ordered two the enchiladas are yummy and filling the house margaritas on happy hour for 3 are perfection all tequila shots on happy hour are half off so it s a good way to try new kinds with out opening your wallet wider than you d like i wish they would bring back the goat cheese and shrimp quesadilla though it was hands down the best thing on the menu when we have friends come to town this is the first place i bring them usually just for an afternoon happy hour to relax sip margaritas and try as many items on the menu as our stomachs can handle when we stopped in last week our server maggie was super helpful with picking out a few tequilas and was very nice the service is always great and on point
  great place in heart of arcadia nice staff great american food and awesome location love this place i go here about 3 times a month check it out
  so i ate here for lunch it was my 1st trip to the place if you are to head here it seems better suited to be a dinner or late night visit first off this place encompasses half a city block well not really but it is pretty huge we decided to sit outside on the patio but the inside looked huge with a large bar 2 pool tables several seating areas the place wasn t too packed but it was after the lunch crowd hour so i m sure we caught it at a light time as for the menu while very good it s just a little heavy for a lunch menu maybe i ordered something a little too filling but from what i saw on the menu everything was more suited to the dinner crowd if they had lunch portions then i think this could make it a little better place to grab lunch the food was great though i d definitely consider going back for dinner next time the one thing i regret not doing was ordering one of their beers i ve heard how good some of them are was planning on ordering a pint but my meal was too filiing i couldn t see myself downing anything else i ll be back for dinner here next time remember to order my beer before i eat my meal
  we arrived here having taken a cab from the strip and i can safely say that it was one of the best meals we ve had in vegas food was great and such a refreshing change from the overpriced food on the strip our waitress was awesome and suggested jewel of russia infusion to us and we nearly drank half the bottle it was so good we will definitely be going there again
  my husband and i went on a date here atmosphere was fantastic the food was not we ordered the calamari appetizer that was so so i had the osso bucco he had lasagna both tasted like they had been previously cooked and then microwaved would be a great place to go for drinks but we won t be eating here again it was too expensive for the food to taste like that
  had dinner at stinky s last evening on a recommendation of a friend meh recommended the codfather fish sandwich and the harp the harp is like a philly cheese steak our party ordered both of these and yes they are very good the stinky chips are thin and crisp very good ok here comes the but it isn t call stinky for no reason the odor of disinfectant was extremely strong even after being inside for 20 minutes the smell still burned the nose if you can get past this the food is good
  big huge slices of fish my biggest ever experienced in arizona i could not believe it the chef just smiled he knew i was happy before i even put it in my mouth the rice was fresh partly because we went for lunch i started off with some warm sake and miso soup a must when you sit at any sushi bar miso was good and then after my dad and i handed our order the chef put some nice fresh wasabi you can tell when it s fresh because of the potent smell and gooey like texture accompanied by a very pink ginger it was very yummy and would hold me off till the sushi arrived first up was the maguro tuna it was alright big slices but not very fresh or flavorful the hamachi yellowtail was different same big slice but fresh bold flavor absolutely delicious then the sake salmon which was good not as good as the hamachi and finally to finish off our nigiri sushi the albacore oh my gosh beautiful presentation with finely sliced scallions on top this was the winner of both my dad and i it was sooo soo soo good then the rolls came out a baked scallop roll which is a califronia roll with massago and scallop on top and also a dragon roll which was unagi freshwater eel inside with spicy tuna and avocado on the outside my dad and i weren t impressed very much by the rolls sort of sloppy in preparation and not very appetizing but the nigiri well it captured our hearts we will be sure to come back and order some different rolls next time i give the chef some credit maybe he didn t have his groove on yet because it was early in the day haha but either way he made loyal customers out of us also the atmosphere here is very quaint family style operation run by wife and husband is what it seemed like very nice friendly people great service and they gave us some complimentary watermelon slices before we left gotta love that parking is great location well right next to sprouts and it s sort of a hole in the wall but nice size once you open the door sushi rolls were 10 each and the sushi was 4 25 each warm sake was 3 99 and i also ordered a cold one which was 8 99 good prices better than kabuki across the street and cheaper sushi price than tokyo lobby but the fish wasn t as good as tokyo lobby
  when in today to get rice and garlic chicken with an order of egg rolls let me tell you that shit hit the spot the sauce for the egg rolls was the bomb i recommend this to anyone i ll be back for more egg rolls and garlic chicken especially the egg roll sauce
  they delivered dinner right to my hotel room door with a 20 minimum dinner order they ll deliver for free when it comes to sushi it s easy to spend that much i ordered a serving of won ton soup the tempura roll the lobster roll and a bottle of water for a total of 25 before tip the won ton soup hit the spot the broth with scallions was delicous with a hint of ginger without being spicy it was only two or three won tons but it was enough of a serving the tempura roll was average and fine the lobster roll was a huge disappointment the menu description was boiled lobter with cucumber and it was just that but the lobster was hard like cardboard and hard to chew it came with duck sauce and soy sauce but that didn t help i couldn t eat it all and i love lobster i would try them again especially since they deliver but i would order different rolls
  36 00 for a whole pizza the wait was about 30 mins did a phone order so i dont have to wait in line it s good but i wouldnt say i would wait for this the only reason i did it was because my friends wanted to eat this
  you can definitely tell as soon as you walk up to switch that it is part of the fez ticoz family the decor is bright modern and colorful a style of atmosphere that always makes me feel comnfortable and excited about the food even before i try it i met kym s here for lunch and wasn t feeling so hot the morning after a pretty long night out on the town before long thanks to some great company and satisfying food i was feeling a lot better kym s ordered the sangria chicken sandwich which came with a side caesar it looked great and was massive but i ll let her comment on how good it was i was craving something really filling so i got the gallette pronounced gah let according to our server with beef and mushrooms 10 45 plus 1 95 to add a field greens salad and it was fantastic i think i was expecting something like a meat pie which it was not but i was happy with what it actually was a thin layer of puff pastry topped with savory beef slices mushrooms and a creamy gouda sauce it really hit the spot the field greens salad was good although it was soaked in dressing which kind of drowned out the flavor of the fresh greens the service was definitely a highlight of the experience our server was very attentive and kept checking back with us he also brought carafes of water and diet coke over which is a brilliant business move on my part it streamlines and facilitates service because people aren t constantly asking for refills and both the servers and customers end up happier the diet coke i ordered was a bit on the pricey side around 2 75 but i was ok with this given the fact that i had a carafe to refill from this is a really nice spot to meet a friend for lunch and i will definitely be back i also think it would make a great place for a casual low key happy hour from their website it looks like they have drink specials from 4 6 30 2 4 1 caipirinhas margaritas and sangria
  great place to grab some tacos the prices match most local taco trucks there s lots of room at this location so it doesn t feel to packed although the live band isn t the best choice to have a tleast not the one that was playing tonight the amount of profanity wasn t exactly inviting i have 3 kids and i was a bit in shock when they started screaming f ck we will definitely be back for more the corn is a must to get way better than roberto s i m glad they stay open later on the weekends fast and friendly service
  this place is boring and tries way too hard the menu is limited i had the pigstrami sandwich it was ok not great i ordered the side salad but the brought me fries they couldn t leave the ketchup alone it was gross because they tried to make it special i will never go back because there are too many other great options in the area
  love the ambiance at this nice little spot came with some friends for a little sunday funday eugene was our bartender and was awesome they make fresh greyhounds by fresh i mean fresh squeezed juice to order sooooo good drinks were good and food was too
  love this place for lunch i always start with the hummus it is delicious and the pita wedges are fresh and you can tell they are made daily for the entree the turkey pita is my fav and the kale salad that accompanies the sandwich is a perfect compliment the only drawback is the place is a bit loud and impersonal at lunch not really ideal for intimate conversations or a business lunch overall it is a solid 4 stars
  this place is a great place to hang out if you live in the area or are just passing thru the bar is clean and the staff is extremely friendly i have been coming here for the last year or so since i moved into the neighborhood and i have never had a bad experience the food is way above par as far as bar food goes but the pricing is still comparative to most other bars in the area
  a regular on my breakfast rotation friendly staff plenty of seating and good food for a good price one of the very few places that has pineapple juice as a selection which is a refreshing change from orange apple cranberry
  the food was ok i was expecting a much better piece of steak we ordered the hanger steak and the classic steak both was alright but nothing to get excited about or wanting to come back for more i definitely think they should substitute some of the fritas for steamed veggies more than half of the plate was the fritas the view was nice from the patio overall it was a nice experience but most likely i won t be coming back again for dinner
  i have eaten here few times while visiting las vegas i have had breakfast and dinner the food has always been always great except coffee which has been below average however i am giving only 3 stars because of service when you are by yourself and not ordering alcohol the serves profile you they know you won t spend tons of money so they don t give you as much attention
  stopped in here with a group of fellow traveler s for the prix fixe lunch before heading up the road to the castle the choices were actually pretty good i ended up with a garlic cheesebread appetizer salmon stuffed chicken and vegetables for the entree and a piece of fudge cake for the dessert the garlic cheesebread was not what i expected it was served on a sliced piece of ciabatta bread with very little melted cheddar cheese it was more like eating toasted bread i couldn t find a hint of garlic in it and i was expecting mozzarella cheese and this italian sounding appetizer it wasn t bad but not what i expected i was thinking more along the lines of an italian dunker than half a grilled cheese sandwich the entree was very well done both the chicken and salmon were superb the sauce on the entree was also quite nice the vegetables were a bit over done and were very limp and flavorless the dessert was also very good and the waitress made this fun for us by playing a goofy birthday song i d never heard before and bringing out a piece with a candle in it for one of our group members who had a birthday i m only giving this 3 stars though for the price i don t think it was a very good value at 22 pounds without beverage almost usd 40 i feel like the portions were a bit small and the culinary value didn t quite command that sort of price it was included in my trip package so i wasn t out anything out of pocket really but i couldn t recommend it to someone else unless it were a bit cheaper nice little place though service was very good and the food came out quickly maybe other dishes would be better and priced more appropriately
  tasty curry i like this place a lot especially because you can chose the level of spice you want i generally like spicy and so level 2 wasn t so bad there was kick to it but i m sure i could have gotten a higher level of spiciness i do wish the portion was a little bigger though but i still would come back regardless two thumbs up
  the standard chain burrito joint that lacks flavor and is way overpriced the burritos are very wet meaning by the time you eat half of it the other half will fall apart so ask for a fork
  i was in town for the cal asu game this past weekend and a few of us bear fans decided to leave sun devil stadium halftime for a beer break well we never made it back for the second half of the game i m originally from south scottsdale so i know the tempe area pretty well and i know that whatever business is on this corner has always failed it seems like every bar that s been in this space has had more of a loungey feel which doesn t really make sense when you re across the street from a football stadium the fact that this place feels like an actual bar is a big plus the place isn t huge and surprisingly wasn t all that crowded for a game day apparently it s only been open a couple of weeks there wasn t much on tap but the four peaks brew that i was drinking was tasty they also had 4 jaager shots which i downed a couple of honestly i didn t get a good look at the menu food or drink but since this place is still in the process of opening everything is still a work in progess i shared an order of nachos with some friends and they didn t disappoint as far as the crowd goes it s a slightly older group of alums 30 s 40 s which is probably why our experience was so pleasant rooting for the visiting team in a college town can be an interesting experience as far as dealing with current students our waitress erica was awesome she was attentive and patient which is a major asset when you re working a college bar the excellent level of service may have had something to with the fact that i told her i yelp my tab seemed a bit smaller than it should have been as well but hey either way i had a great time since i don t live here i obviously won t become a regular but i would definitely recommend this place to those hanging out around the asu campus who want an alternative to the mill scene
  my boyfriend and i have been here 3 times in the past 3 weeks i visited s korea last summer and the food here is exactly how it was there from the way it is served to the taste my boyfriend loves the spicy pork and i really like the bulgogi the tofu soups are delicious as well the only thing that makes me a little sad is that they no longer serve the patbingsu due to lack of popularity how do people not love red bean it s delicious the first time we came the lady who helped us was nice enough to make me some though for dessert they now serve iced coffee or fresh fruit additionally the people who work here are incredibly nice and they remember us every time we come in prices are great we will definitely be returning many many more times to get our korean food fill
  amazing place to hangout great prices for beers must visit place after the management change this place has transformed drastically to greatness their manager jeff has done a great job and is always on site for help the service is great and fast over all great food great beer great place
  a ok hole in the wall authentic mexican seafood place in a not so great part of town coworkers and i tried this place out for lunch one of them was raving about how great it was and i am always one to try new things especially seafood restaurant itself is spacious and clean inside you can buy fresh seafood we sat down and waitress came to our table i don t like how she didn t address us in english only one of us knew spanish they serve chips and salsa on the house which was nice it was very tasty with the right amount of spice i ordered a langostino dish don t remember the exact name refer to the pic below it was served with rice beans salad and tortilla the dish overall was ok edible but there was something off about the taste maybe i was scared to break out which was what happened to my other coworker the last time he came so i had some trepidation about my meal he had shrimp in a prior visit he avoided it this time around and the tortillas tasted weird i don t know if it was homemade or cooked in lard but i only had one and it was enough to keep me from wanting more i don t see myself coming back the price overall was decent it was paid for lol but i wouldn t come back and pay on my own i m not sure if i d really recommend this restaurant due to its location and overall average experience
  while i ve been here a number of times i haven t explored the menu enough to provide a comprehensive review good weekend bloody mary 3 4 star generous pour with limited accompaniments but they worked prime rib good flavor ok cut a little thin and cooked on the medium side when i asked for medium rare burger not too bad pork tenderloin sandwich good i d order it again mozzarella sticks contender for the best in town fries were ok not so good service a bit slow chicken sandwich was dry and had a small piece of chicken didn t finish it despite skipping breakfast bathroom mens could use some work rocky point puerto penasco location do yourself a favor and close that place down
  i ve been to social only twice even though it is within walking distance of home easy and is on the no wait app that definitely says something i ve even been putting off this review because of how unmentionable our 2nd visit here was the first time coming here 1 and i were feeling adventurous we re not big eaters so the dirty bird a thai skewer type starter and margherita pizza sounded great to share the skewers were small but done well paired with rice i ate most of this glaring at the poor man when he went to reach for another the pizza was mostly basil but we still ate half it was better as leftovers the next morning for sure but nothing incredible i think the saddest part was how boring our bevvies were delicious but too simple the wolfhound is my kind of sweet vodka with elderflower of course dream but at the crafty cocktail price no overall the service this night was great and we decided overall we could come here again it would work well for groups with pissy picky eaters me unfortunately the next time i was here not so lucky a girlfriend and i were out for drinks and wanted a little munchies upon arriving we were carded at the door by some random unmarked man just hanging out there weren t any servers or hosts so we figured bar only fine the crowd was horrific kids that looked not old enough to be there seated around the packed bar with rowdy older couples the whole thing was not my style we were finally given drink menus without a word kitchen must be closed fine again we ordered our drinks about ten minutes later when she chose to acknowledge us two prosecco cosmos they arrived frothy and low in the glass there is no nice way to say it but they were soapy almost a pear shampoo use your imagination we laid our 25 on the counter in cash and got out of there silver lining we had our lyft driver drop us off at aiello s to make up for the horrific time at social it was necessary looking for creepy patrons and horrible boring overpriced drinks this is your spot get excited for nonverbal bartenders too if you re desperate during the kitchen hours it s okay i wouldn t suggest it but i d grudgingly tag along
  this is hands down one of the best restaurants in town my husband and i have been here to eat many times and the food is consistently excellent the restaurant is always clean and the staff is super friendly when it came time to decide on what food to serve at our intimate backyard wedding the choice was clear dave the owner worked with us on creating a menu of our favorite foods and arrived the day of our wedding prepared and professional and of course the food was amazing
  oh yayo taco where have you been all my life i would have never known about this place if it weren t for yelp thanks yelp tucked away in a corner of a half empty shopping plaza with no real sign telling you the name of the place i would have driven by a thousand times and been none the wiser but not this day i was informed and ready to get my taco on the reason i was so excited to get here was the rumor that they had vegetarian tacos imagine my surprise when there was not just one but four tacos on the menu that were veggie friendly no seriously imagine it i ll wait so my husband and i both ordered the combo which includes 4 tacos i got one of each of course two sides and a drink for our sides we both got chips and salsa i got the rice and he got the fries while we waited for our food we found a seat and instantly fell in love this place has a super fun colorful dive bar feel that my husband and i loved how could you not have a smile on your face when you see a couple sharks on the wall or a picture of a chick with a hook for a hand although there is writing all over the walls and tables that does not mean the place is dirty it was super clean if you can t handle some writing on your table then you should go back to the strip to eat the combos are huge so come hungry the rice was flavorful the chips were perfectly cooked and salted and even the fries were great i wasn t expecting much there from a mexican joint the tacos are loaded with onions peppers zucchini and even some baby spinach i had to eat mine with a knife and fork so i didn t make a mess on the white shirt i inappropriately wore for the day the veggies weren t greasy like some other reviewers seemed to have a problem with and the tacos were loaded with lots of sauce i didn t have a 100 fairy tale experience here and i ll tell you why three of the four tacos looked and tasted pretty much the same to me i was having a hard time figuring out the difference between them three of my tacos should have had tofu one had a lot another had a tiny bit and the third had none at all also the tacos could have used a little more flavor oomph however big props for having several choices for us veggie people friendly service and a fun atmosphere my husband and i are really excited to get back for some adult beverages and of course eat up a couple veggie tacos
  cool atmosphere happy hour not bad fish tacos are pretty delish will come back again close to stadium which is nice for game day
  i ve had one okay experience at thai lahna and one pretty bad experience the first trip my friend and i received our food promptly and it was good i had the pad kee mow and it was tasty and the serving size was large enough to have a take home box the service was nothing to write home about but it wasnt awful the second time i came with my husband the service was deplorable it took us 20 minutes just to get a glass of water and an acknowledgement of our presence my husband ordered pad see eew i m so sorry i don t know the correct spelling i m just going phonetically here and the waitress told him that they didn t have it it s a pretty common thai dish so he asked for it by a different name like drunken noodles and she said she didn t know it again and only knew the number common for restaurants with hard to pronounce dishes she said she didn t know the names of the dishes she just wrote down the numbers she was really short with us and basically belted that if it wasnt on the menu they didn t have it she then asked her colleague to come over to our table to again point out that they don t have the dish and began speaking over our table to each other in spanish she then left for 10 minutes when someone from the kitchen staff came out my husband asked again for the dish he desired and the staff member knew it immediately and put in the order i can understand a fresh server and someone who isn t as familiar with the menu but to be put on the floor with zero training and to be so rude to a customer really blows my mind
  my favorite bagel shop in the qc unique combos fun atmosphere quick service and the bagels are delish definitely make sure you come here
  frozen fusion margaritas are awesome love them cornbread and food is also all incredibly great here
  ok food found a hair on my honey dew melon slice disgusting 4 50 for a glass of cranberry juice nothing spectacular rather try something else
  this place is always quick and delicious you won t be disappointed the sweet potato fries are my favorite and the sauces are delightful the only downside is that it s pricey for a mid level restaurant that serves like a burrito joint if there was one closer to my beating path i would eat there more if the price was a little lower
  this is one of my favorite mexican restaurants in town they have the usual expected menu tacos burritos enchiladas etc at really reasonable prices in the years that i have been going there the food has always been delicious and everyone i have taken has been won over the staff is friendly and attentive i have always had really good service i can t say enough about la canasta this place is awesome two things though the dining room closes at 7 pm and they don t do separate checks
  love coming here decided to go after passing by everyday i was impressed the chicken lettuce wraps are delicious ive ordered so much sushi from here that i cant name but it is always really good and well made popiahs are good no complaints for this place i m a regular here
  what is a better way to shop than drinking free tea don t sit here and read my review do yourself the favor of jumping in the car and going over there to see what it s all about the people that run the store sorry i forgot the guys name and the mom grandmom esk indian woman in the back cooking samosas just totally embody what we are all looking for when we walk into a place for the first time try this taste that have a cup of tea dear bring your friends bring your family grab a cart and go on an excursion take your time this place is sweet and so are the people running it
  haven t had much bbq in town but this is my go to spot with the trio platter of meats and sides noticed a price increase on their menu recently which bothers me but i don t mind paying for their excellent food always have leftovers so better make sure you re hungry sides i recommend include the cornbread greens mashed potatoes and onion strings made the mistake of going on a sunday when they weren t open so check them out monday through saturday
  good sandwiches fast delivery call don t order online for the quickest delivery i have had an issue with an order once and they took care of ot quickly
  gave this place a try since i saw it is now open initially i was going to order a burger until i saw they had pastrami on the menu i was thrown by the prices a bit for a fast food place it all seemed a bit overpriced i had a pastrami sandwich that cost almost 8 for just the sandwich no fries or drink because that would have been almost 12 now the sandwich had mustard pickles cheese and was on garlic ciabatta bread i liked the flavor of the meat it was tender and the other stuff on the sandwich all meshed well together for 2 people to eat complete meals here it can run around 25 which is too pricey for a drive thru joint i did find on their website though how you can sign up for deals and they had printable coupons posted for really good deals on meals that include a drink i will come back with coupons because i did like the sandwich but i d never pay regular price
  went to taylor s for breakfast and was thoroughly satisfied with all aspects of this cute little restaurant the menu had lots of interesting options but wasn t overwhelming i was impressed with the service even before our server brought my friend more hot water for her tea without having to request it i had the open face omelet with spinach scallions and goat cheese with a bialy the dish was very tasty and came with a side of fresh fruit i thought the bialy was more bagel like than bialy but i wasn t in ny so i don t live in phoenix and was brought to this restaurant while my husband and i were in town for a couple of days i thought it was a great choice if i did live in phoenix and i had to take friends to breakfast who were in from out of town i would definitely consider taylor s
  had to bring this down to four stars went back for the third time yesterday and the food has only gotten better and the service has only gotten worse it took our drinks 25 min to get to us we ordered our drinks about 10 min before our food and actually got our food before our drinks we ordered another drink as soon as our first arrived for fears of never getting another one our waters were empty non stop this is how it always is here and the waiter asked if we needed anything else three times each time we said yes the bill i will still continue to come here because i know they are going to quick and the food is so amazing but come on nearly half an hour for a pre made frozen margarita
  best greek restaurant in the valley the owner really makes you feel at home service is fantastic and the food is delicious whether you want a traditional gyro or something a little more eclectic this place has it all and the best part is it s family owned so you know your money is going back to the source
  used to love this place when i worked nearby i went by for a banh mi and they got my order wrong the girl gave me an attitude when i told her and tried to charge me again i swore i d never go back but later gave them a second chance i ordered about banh mi and waited a good 20 min there was about five people in the restaurant at one point i went up to the register and the guy handed me my to go bag without saying anything it was sitting there the whole time i was sitting right in front of him
  i am standing outside as we speak waiting for my husband to pay no desert there was no way i was waiting and our waitress seemed like she was done for the night anyway the service was horrible our waitress started out fine then half way through our meal abandoned us would not even make eye contact i guess we were too much trouble for her the table of six that just got seated got all her attention had to get a different waitress to bring the check had to flag down a busboy to order another beer i usually way over tip but i told my husband i would disown him if he left a tip ruined our date night so disappointed 15 minutes into the dinner i thought we d found out new favorite place the restaurant is smaller than i thought and all the hard surfaces echo all the noise it became too much to handle thus i wait outside i tend to avoid crab mix because i do not like mayo actually i loathe it so when we ordered two rolls that did not list crab mix i was disappointed that they were both loaded with crab mix and mayonnaise the only thing i tasted was mayonnaise more mayo than a tuna sandwich wtf will never go back there are too many good restaurants in the area i m so disappointed because i was lovin it the salmon collar and the soft shell crab sweet potato appetizer were delicious
  not a big fan of burgers and i thought the burgers tasted like mcdonalds burgers but i was hungry it s a place seems like everyone after clubs and bars go to
  the herb box is a fantastic place to have lunch or get something to go i have eaten in as well as to go many times and yesterday stopped by and took home the turkey avocado wrap sweet potato chips and oatmeal cookie so large i could only have a few bites i couldn t help but have a cheat meal i hadn t been in awhile delicious i normally do not order wraps anywhere but they are so wonderful here again i do not usually get desert but their cookies are wonderful the oatmeal cookie really tastes like oatmeal and raisins instead of a pile of sugar everything is so fresh and high quality did i mention they have diet coke a must in my book and it is free refills which isn t out of the ordinary but the specialty is it is poured from the can the most amazing little restaurant i love the feeling i have when i am there it is a place you want to bring a book and enjoy alone or with friends it is small but that is the attraction to go is always great at this restaurant not like others where you do not get the same quality this might be because they are a catering company i am new to arizona and miss having lunch with my girlfriends when i come here not only is the food wonderful i feel like i am a part of something it s great p s i see there is a location in dc ranch now and looks like it is more than just a lunch place i will have to try this but for now only have experienced the original love it
  if you want teriyaki chicken this is the best place in my opinion i ve been to teriyaki boy and teriyaki madness and i didn t think they were that good at all the only thing is that it s located inside galleria mall so it s not exactly a quick pick up if your not already inside the mall i ve only really stuck to the chicken but they do have the option for steak and shrimp also they give you decent portions but if your thinking about taking some home or sharing there is also an option for double meat for a minimal extra charge make sure to ask for extra sauce too
  this is a good sandwich shop because you get a lot for your money and it s a good place to decompress if you want to get away from all the excitement in las vegas when i went there the place was completely empty however don t let that deter you from checking it out the only thing this place needs is hot sauce i m used to finding that at sandwich shops and i was surprised to find that they didn t have any here good sandwiches and fun employees make this place worth checking out
  service sucks my bf went in to use the bathroom while i was in the car getting my son out before we went into the restaurant i sat down and the owner was yelling to take my order when my bf got out of the bathroom the owner yells out oh i didnt know u where with them i guess he was mad that he used their bathroom their table cover is the paper you lay on in the doctors office but the pizza was good if the owner and his family wasnt so rude id tip them and give them 4 stars
  the best thai place i ve ever eaten at great vegan options i used to eat here all the time a few years ago i miss it so we are going tonight the area is a little scary but worth it for the great food and plum wine i kind of like the decoration in there also makes it feel like grandmas house hoping for another great experience since i m bringing my bf and his family here later tonight
  the food here is always good if you get a bowl you can select the size and ingredients to your liking there is a great selection of proteins as well as variety of veggies and fruits to add topped with the sauce and spices to complete the experience they also accommodate for soy allergies so that s a bonus
  it was perfect and authentic we weren t up for picking crabs this evening but enjoyed the lump crab cake made maryland style
  it s the real thing i ve been to n awlins many many times this is what the food tastes like try the cornish game hen you won t be sorry
  yes to all of the above woodlands is simply fantastic though we d been wanting to try it for a while we hadn t trekked out to woodlands simply because it was in our eyes all the way out in the boonies off albemarle road despite growing up in the clt i can count on one hand the times i have actually driven on albemarle road imagine my surprise then when we passed the old eastland mall and i was all ohhhh this is where eastland used to be anyway last night however searching for a restaurant that wasn t participating in restaurant week we decided to head out to woodlands and we were pleasantly surprised when it took us less than 15 minutes to get out there excellent despite previous reviews the exterior and decor weren t particularly off putting it seems to me that almost every great indian place i ve eaten at has a very similar set up udipi in cary anyone so it felt like home i do love opening a menu and knowing i can order anything off it this time i settled on the chef s specialty of chana batura and husband ordered aloo gobi and garlic naan the puffy bread with my dish was like a light unsweetened funnel cake fried indulgent deliciousness and it sopped up the chana so very well the chana were perfect husband s aloo gobi was so delicate and tasty and the garlic naan just blew me away yum to absolutely everything we also ordered a couple samosas which were also perfect just the right amount of spice and flaky beyond belief the service was excellent for what it s worth although we ve got maharani around the corner which i like very much as well as copper which underwhelms me despite all its hoopla i imagine we ll be making the well worth it drive out to woodlands when we re in the mood for particularly fabulous indian food love this place
  i love this place my co workers and i have lunch here on occassion and we have yet to try something from the wonderfully creative menu that we don t like the people running this place are some of the nicest i ve come across in food service in quite a while i ve only been for dinner once and it was almost closing time but they did not try to rush us one bit the most recent pizza i tried was the ponderosa it has ranch and bbq with chicken tomato and onion which i switched out for red peppers at the suggestion of the guy behind the counter and it was delicious i would also recommend their salad the house dressing is really good they have a small selection of wine and beer too
  worst dining experience i ve had in a long time i ordered the half sandwich and soup combo it was grilled cheese and french onion the sandwich was a piece of plastic like cheese on some plain toast the soup was even worse it was a tiny bowl of broth with a slice of cheese placed on top super disappointed couldn t even eat it i will never come back here again
  i had high expectations of this place because of the awesome reviews and all of the yelp pictures looked amazing so we were pretty stoked to finally check it out overall it was just an okay experience we did not get what we payed for and believe me we have no problem paying for good food we ordered the pork belly and also the cream corn with lobster for appetizers the pork belly was very flavorful but it was a bit salty it only came with one slice i couldn t taste the lobster in the cream corn the cream corn lacked cream and flavor and was also a bit dried our entrees did kinda make up for the appetizers we got the bass and the duck they kinda overdid the lemon on the bass but other than that it tasted pretty good the duck was pretty good as well out of everything the service was probably the worst it wasn t super busy at the time that we went there were 3 different servers and not one of them checked up on us throughout our dinner no smiles and just kept walking past us they never filled up our waters they never offered a dessert menu seemed like they didn t wanna be there i did notice that it was the same service for the tables next to us as well so it wasn t just us if we re paying this much i expect the service to be top notch i m sure if we came on another day and there s different servers and if we ordered other items on the menu we would have a better experience good to try once but because of the experience that we had we won t be returning
  the ambiance presents a nice and relaxing environment to start your day we arrived a little afternoon so ordered two lunch apps with breakfast entrees the soup de jour was tomato and it was fine basic lots of cream and didn t really deliver that amazing tomatoey goodness we were looking for with the soup came our pommes frites which were the best food of the meal hot crispy creamy inside and seasoned perfectly our entrees consisted of the omelette with bacon tomato and spinach and the french toast with cinnamon apples and caramelized bananas the omelette was basic nothing special and certainly not seasoned bland and boring it was definitely a disappointment the french toast was good it comes out looking like a square of bread pudding but has a nice flavor and consistency we also ordered 2 overpriced champagne cocktails both were fine but i was in no way blown away our server was very nice and professional but overall the food was not what i would expect from a thomas keller restaurant
  i got a burrito and unlike a few other authentic places in town the quality of the meat is noteworthy no gristle not fat and very delicious price is right and although the size could be a little bigger they do pack a good amount of meat in there will return
  this place seemed like it would be in an airport except that the food was actually good here counter service great selection of salads sandwiches soup and breakfast items along with daily specials the staff was very friendly and helpful explaining every item i asked about and even gave us samples to taste you can see salads and other stuff on display in the cold case but they actually make your salad to order i got the cobb see pics with dijon vinaigrette it was really really good i loved that dressing and everything was crisp cold and fresh i also ordered a small size of the white bean soup see pics as you can see it was huge i ended up taking it home and had it for dinner there is a draw back to this place though seating sucks only a few small tables and some counter seating i would suggest coming here solo or only with 1 person unless you sit outside they do have a large patio with alot of tables wth this is az the main dining area should be inside aside from that i thought the food was great and i would definitely eat here again
  this place is just an average casino buffet that you can find everywhere nothing too bad and nothing too special
  this has been on my list for quite sometime and it finally worked out that i was in the area for lunch didn t quite see anything on the buffet i wanted so i ordered from the menu i got 3 maki rolls and 2 yakitori skewers the sushi was very fresh and the spicy tuna roll was unique instead of the typical spicy mayo it had a some what bbq sauce with a nice heat to it different but not bad in any way the bacon wrapped scallop yakitori is damn good will most definitely come back in the future
  very good food with lots of choices but my favorite thing has to be the iced tea selection i will not return to a restaurant that doesn t have good tea this place has an iced tea bar different flavors it is wonderful makes me wish they offered larger cups but i get it will return many times
  worst chicken parm ever including frozen meals but very good pizza i give it 2 stars if you are an italian place it is not acceptable to have terrible chicken parm sorry
  this place is always good i eat here as often as possible the food is great and so is the service
  absolutely horrible i ve had bad service at other ihop locations but this particular location receives a gold medal for worst service ever i was told the wait would be 15 minutes max and 30 minutes later my party was seated the sodas were flat and warm ick so the waitress exchanged them for fresh ones which were also flat and warm we settled for water and coffee can t go wrong there i suppose except for the water glasses had bits of food stuck to them from the food took an absurdly long time to come out when it did we were all disappointed friend s pancakes included several black hairs inside of the pancake my side of ranch was obviously old with a yellow tinge and sour taste my breakfast sandwich was drenched in butter other friend s pancakes were so soggy in the middle that they kind of congealed together everyone s breakfast sausage was dry and bland for specializing in pancakes and being known for their breakfast dishes this place sucked i won t be spending my money here again ever
  the service was fast and friendly the food was fast fresh and yummy we got chicken satay chicken yellow curry and duck fried rice we were in and out in under 30 min parking was easy to find great dive
  love the place but wished it was somewhere else the place has a very old school vegas feel to it dim light maroon leather booths green walls very intimate food was fantastic service was spectacular and wine selection was outstanding a classic vegas place that is a must check out to have a vintage vegas experience dont let the fact that it is in circus circus dissuade you it is definitely worth the trip
  how does this chain place still retain such a local feel allow me to count the ways the people working here try talking to me in spanish i applaud the effort and then abruptly stop when i give them my i don t understand look each store is set up a little differently meaning some locations look grungier than others the inconsistency of the food makes you believe they are actually cooking there is no dollar menu volcano taco or mascot to promote their food overall roberto s deserves a 3 5 star but i have to round them down even though they ve filled my belly many a time in the wee hours of the night since the stuff i order is totally greasy and unhealthy and my heart just won t allow to give them four thump thump thump thump
  we came here for nye 13 dinner about halfway through our dinner a country folk band started performing extremely depressing songs not my idea of new years cheer the food was awesome i loved every bite of it our waitress asked us to order the specials since they were competing to sell the most i thought that was unprofessional and uncomfortable all four of us ended up getting a special but not because she had requested it the ribs were to die for the meat was tender and the truffles mushrooms were cooked well i don t know if this special will be offered again but if it is i highly recommend it minus a star because they won t make an irish coffee my bf ordered one and they would only serve him one of their fancy drinks how hard is it to put whisky into coffee at a restaurant with a bar
  my wife and i love the chips salsa at this place the food is simply awesome and really delicious but folks if your in the mood for a light snack you cant go wrong with a margarita from here the chips salsa it s really awesome
  lunch salmon piccatta with lemon butter all the way best value for money and so delicious
  another of my favorites they have a great happy hour with small plates for 5 ea at the bar i a particularly fond of the beef tenderloin with brie served on small slices of toast and the house salad the restaurant itself is very not phoenix big plush bars dark room roaring fire when you are in the rokeril you can forget that it is a seething inferno outside the only reason that i am giving them a 4 instead of a 5 is that their cuts of meat seem to be fattier than i am accustomed to my so and i have noticed this with both beef and lamb cuts overall a fantastic dining experience though and we are both always happy to diner here
  this place is amazing the service is great our meal was so yummy and good the vie is a plus
  disappointed had the shrimp burrito lots of rice very little shrimp
  came friday in early evening honestly this is tasty food but the place is extremely crowded and loud i am not a poutine expert but can t believe the poutine would be vastly better here than elsewhere if you want a real boisterous experience then this is a great choice otherwise i d look elsewhere
  excellent neighborhood hang out place love the sunday half off steak great service
  great food and cozy atmosphere its authentic italian i always enjoy eating here whether i m dressed up or not they make me feel at home you need to have reservations though if it is a busy night but it is worth calling ahead for it is especially nice when lois is working she makes everyone feel like family
  i can t tell you enough how much i love this place i love the scenery it s like you re not in phoenix anymore the farm has three places to eat i am more of a picnic girl specifically because i know i can get sweet potato salad and a portobello sandwich and frolick in the grass okay so i don t frolick but i do sit on a cute bench everytime i m there they have a new soup it s like a birthday present midweek i swear the weddings are beautiful there and morning glory is good for company in town
  if you love real spicy chinese food this is the place see the reviewer jenny c s reivew she hits the nail on the head and like her i only go for the sichuan food not the american chinese food if you re not familiar it s all about chili peppers and tongue numbing peppercorns the sichuan menu is pretty robust and while i can t help but order dry fried chicken i really love the mala the cumin beef and the fish there are a few things i ve yet to try but it will happen i really respect the fact that they don t offer a 1 10 scale or any such thing if there are 3 chili peppers then the dish is really really really spicy either order it or not i also tip my hat and tip monitarily the waitresses they hustle not only serving but bussing in a very busy restaurant they don t miss a beat they don t get your order wrong they don t forget to refill your water they bring your check when you re done without having to ask be wary of going on weekends at lunch and dinner it gets really busy and you may have to wait for a table
  hands down best burger you ll ever eat this place is a must try you won t be sorry
  great service and food i m a nyker that moved to the valley of the sun less than a year ago and finding good food here is hard i live in north phx and everything here is chain restaurants or food badly made i went in with low expectations but was pleasantly surprise by their staff food choices prices and great service i have visited this place three times already and am planning to become a regular
  love the friendliness great food
  great restaurant no awesome place to find a cure for constipation abso friggin lutely get a 5 buck box wait 2 hours and let the good times flow right out of your rectum like greased lightning also if you like dating big nasties that work at taco bell this place is the spot to be on the upside they are generally nice and usually get your order right
  service is great always accommodating our big group love the kenny roll tried the johnny no rice roll rolled with cucumber omg sooo good we have been here 3 times and each time the service got better we had a birthday cake and forgot a knife they helped with that they took pictures for us they speed or cake for us and all with a smile rolls came out quick for a group of 15 we will be back for sure
  the brunch food is just plain ol good french food i ll find anywhere on the streets of orange county i m so glad i chose to eat here instead of an infamous buffet same cost but less evil on the body the wait to sit outside is about 5 times that of sitting indoors actually we didn t have to wait at all for a table inside but the atmosphere is calm and soothing the food i m sure is just as great the whipped cream from the blueberry pancakes is to die for i dipped everything in there at least once even my eggs benedict if you re with a group of girls and don t feel like binging start the day out here and you won t regret
  we came at 5 30 on a tuesday evening and we were the only customers at the time our waitress was very attentive and friendly but spoke very little english the restaurant is rather small but nicely decorated it is north of a walgreens pharmacy and just south of the mcdonalds and directly across the street from a subway and a tattoo shop on alma school rd we ordered off of both the regular and the chinese menu started with fried potstickers juicy large and flavorful next came pork egg fu yong which had a nice flavor and lots of pork piled on top but some how was very difficult to cut and twice cooked pork which had a lot of tender very thin slices of pork onions red hot little peppers some ginger and other chinese veggies although i asked for it to be spicy it had little heat to it the fortune cookies were quite fresh sweet and crispy i have taken away a star from the food the very friendly owner chef came out to see how we liked the food and with his very broken english promised he would make some wonderful dishes for us next time we will probably return to try some other menu items
  i ve been to every firefly location in town this particular location in the summerlin area i ve been to a couple of times and the service really wasn t all that great i do love everything i ve tried on the menu which is a good handful of items i cannot say anything bad about the food on a positive note personal favorites are the firefly fries crispy and served with shredded parmesan cheeses and really good dipping sauce delicate little bacon wrapped dates spicy beef salad calamari tomato soup sliders chicken skewers empanadas and a few others at every location the food is similarly presented every time and is absolutely delicious the prices are a little high for tapas but a few options shared will still leave everyone with a full and happy belly the one thing you always have to get when you come with a group of friends is a pitcher of sangria or the passion fruit mojitos so yummy the service at this particular location however is another story it has never really been outstanding first of all the hostesses were not pleasant and did not really appear like they wanted to be working there our waiter was hardly that friendly and did not return once to our table to check up on us and see how we were doing when we had dined there for about two hours the busser was not very nice either she came a few times to see if we were done with our plates when i was clearly still eating and when i told her that she seemed really annoyed we asked for another serving of bread to go with our cheese fondue dish and she forgot about that since our waiter never came back once i had to track him down in order for us to get a chance to order some of the nutella crepe dessert that they have i think waitstaff is pretty important they make a big part of the dining experience and contribute to the ambiance of the place i am not trying to bag on this restaurant at all because i know i ll be back for the food but i sure hope i ll get waited by people who know what impeccable customer service is like next time
  so i have been to plenty of smash burgers and i can say they are all consistent i have never been to one that was better or worse when it comes to food where they change is in service and cleanliness this one was not that busy but had several dirty tables and some that had been wiped down were not wiped well i still they there burgers are better than 5 guys but 5 guys have better fries i think their shakes are good here as well
  staff is always friendly this location is always packed and there is usually a wait to get in
  best fast burger in town
  for a while i was addicted to this place and would walk for 30mins just to get my shawarma fix the meat were fresh and plentiful the people were friendly and the garlic sauce was exceptional
  best chinese food in surprise and very friendly environment
  i love old school vegas places so i ve obviously had hugo s bookmarked for a while and finally visited last night first the setting downtown in the 4 queens so you get the full vintage feeling that i think is kinda lacking at piero s or golden steer of course the four queens has pretty much moved beyond vintage to dated and smoky so luckily the restaurant is located literally in the cellar away from the nastiness of the casino second the ambiance all brick walls with old paintings everywhere the furniture is newer but definitely not modern i think they could probably spruce things up a little without losing the feel of the place for instance 1970s glass lamp shades shaped like flowers third the service perfect friendly prompt knowledgeable all over it with our water refills and busing our dirty plates but i never felt like they were hovering i loved that the sommelier came around to chat with everybody and he was great very approachable explained things to us without being snooty and definitely did not scoff at our price point i love love love that the sommelier has been there almost 30 years the busser 15 years and the waiter 15 years fourth the food great we started with the escargot which were rich and buttery just like they should be we each had an order of 6 but i wished we would have split because i was already getting full moved on to the salad which many people have described it might be nice if one of the offerings was just make me a caesar salad but i appreciated all the options all the ingredients were fresh and plentiful for entrees we had the sea bass new england style and the beef wellington both were delicious but i thought the wellington really stood out both the beef and the pastry were cooked perfectly and the sauce added the perfect flavor also the meat was so tender not a bit stringy like i expected finally topped it off with the chocolate dipped fruits which were a nice tough it was so much food and we didn t even touch the bread basket that we each brought home at least half of our entree finally the damage 250 fine dining salads appetizers entrees mini desserts a bottle of wine and tip totally worth it i wouldn t mind stopping back by for a martini at the bar when i m in the area sometime
  everything was fresh and cooked to order and thank you for being a chicken strip place that isn t scared to leave em in the fryer for a little bit to get extra crispy the fries were great too not too much salt also cooked to order you can get a 3 tender meal with fries for under 10 so it s a clutch lunch spot or for a late night snack
  i miss coming here i moved from az and this is almost worth the plane trip in itself for these raw goodies everything is made fresh in house you won t find corn syrup or sodas or gmo products instead you will find organic vegan and raw selections that won t make you feel you are sacrificing taste for healthy when i m visiting az this is the first place i want to eat at everything here is delicious and while the menu does keep a few classics it also rotates with fresh soups of the day desserts and juices to keep new tempting offerings to chose from and my taste buds wanting more
  took my son here for lunch last week it was his first experience at biaggio s pizza we ordered a large meatlover s pizza see pics we patiently waited for it to be prepared and sat in the dining area and chatted with biaggio for a few minutes he s a really nice guy who enjoys his business our pizza came out after a short wait and we devoured it within minutes it is as good as i remembered my son couldn t stop talking about it i wish we lived nearby so we could come more often overall it s one of the best pizza joints in town return factor 99
  brio s is a lovely italian restaurant in the south park area as expected the restaurant is beautiful i set outside on the patio i was quickly seated and had a very attentive server i ordered the vegetable panini which was very delicious and was also a pretty decent size amount considering the price it also came with a quinoa side salad overall i would say this place is worth a try its nothing super special but the food is not bad either i d say about average
  we went to this buffet for sunday brunch and it was terrible service was bad food was bad overall experience was bad the only good part of this buffet was the chocolate fountain i wanted to dip some banana pieces in the fountain but even those were brown save your money eat somewhere else
  my whole family and i love this place you walk in sit whenever you d like or you can make a togo order the staff is always friendly and accommodating they have old 6 packs on the table that house their condiments and hold up their paper menus this is a very laid back no frills place which is great when you just want to be casual i always order the chicago dog with a hot link and the clam strips with wasabi ranch so awesome this is a family owned place so you will see pretty much the same faces everytime you come in they have beer on draft and even rootbeer on draft if you haven t been i suggest you go love this place
  so this place is a korean owned japanese restaurant i guess it doesn t matter as long as they know how to make the food right the hubs went to order as the boy and i sat at a table the hubs and the guy at the register hit it off and did some small talk he was really friendly we ordered 2 of the ramen noodle bowls it took about 15 20 before they came out the bowl was just okay nothing too tasty and a little bland i wish they didn t have the wooden chopsticks that you break apart to eat the ramen it definitely didn t make the ramen taste any better we will come back and try out the sushi next time and who knows maybe their ramen will be better too it s a new place so we ll give it another try
  first time i went here i set the bar low and this place hurdled it easily this time i had the bar set high after my first experience and it still crushed it hands down best restaurant in arizona only 5 star restaurant and its obvious the martinis whoa think matthew mccanaughy from wolf of wall st and just keep them coming
  service was slow food was tasteless and it was very expensive for what you got would not go back if you see this place keep walking it s not worth it
  food was good but i was embarrassed that the portions were sooo big definitely take home and make multiple meals
  gimmicky as far as the lobsicle and bisque avoid the lobsicle was tasty but was tiny not worth the the bisque was watered down ive had better bisque from costco
  2 stars for having to wait to be served wondering if we were forgotten and for not seating people well at tables which increases the wait time before you sit 6 stars for some of the best authentic delicious hearty amazing pizza i ve had in a while while my family was bummed that we didn t get a real brunch since delucca s and pamela s were ridiculously long wait times the awesomeness of this pizza mediterranean style 4 stars
  i m a fan of the grand lux and actually had a dinner party here several years ago it is of course owned by the cheesecake factory so if you like their cuisine then you will be in for a similar treat this place could easily be a 4 or 5 star place for a casual nice eatery but it seems as if they try to turn some of their food into the food of a much more upscale establishment this isnt bad necessarily but its often executed not quite as great as they probably hope maybe i m too simple but when i order a salad i expect to be able to eat lettuce their caesar is large leaf lettuce nestled onto each other with sparse dressing and two pieces of cheese and no croutons really really its a salad cut me some slack plus their food isn t as flavorful as cheesecake factory which i dont consider their food super seasoned soooo its hit or miss but generally not bad id go again but i wont go out of my way to return
  this is our favorite local restaurant we ve been coming here for dinners and a mother s day brunch since mid 2009 when i found it on yelp it s in a nondescript shopping center and if not for the constant traffic jam outside you probably wouldn t even notice it i particularly like the lighting inside the restaurant it s very relaxed and seems classier than it should be given the location the burger is great but the chicken sandwich is easily the best i ve had i also enjoy the pcg pasta and they have a lot of great beers on tap we live in chandler now but i ll make the drive to pcg any time i get an opportunity
  i love this place it s a great place to chill play some life size social games grab a drink and even eat it s 24 7 great place for a chill date or hanging with friends life size beer pong corn hole and shuffleboard to name a few if you are in downtown come here
  this is my first proper midwestern meal in a midwestern town i was meeting a friend for dinner and she recommended here as my debut into the cuisine of madison indeed the old fashioned achieved that admirably the beer selection was capacious and i had cheese curds that i believe to be both delicious and probably authentic i ordered the old fashioned burger beef patty crunchy bacon veggies an egg on top but i had requested medium rare and it came more like a medium well done also the fries on the side were somewhat soft and tasteless i would peg this institution more as a social gathering place where a group of friends share a beer instead of a wholehearted restaurant dedicated to the art of fine food
  solid breakfast the service is great 15 minute wait was more like 10 minutes try the vanilla waffle super fluffy and solid flavor but really big overall good place to get breakfast on the strip
  came back two years later and with no customers in there the lady still took 5 mins to greet us then we were greeted by what what you looking for lmao how is this place still in business we walked right out what a p o s
  you know i ve seen this place showcased on food network about 5 times in the span of 5 years or so and it looked delicious so during prego 2012 the wife we went on our last trip prior to ava being born to cleveland ohio i already know relax so we spontaneously map the drive to pittsburgh cause we re just wingin this shit drove 2 1 2 hours and wow were we disappointed i know we sort of set ourselves up for disappointment by driving over a hour with lofty expectations but oh well we do what we do how can you go wrong with pastrami coleslaw fries on italian bread the entire thing needed more flavor some au jus maybe some salt maybe on tv it looked like salt punch from the pastrami or corned beef the starch and salt from the natural cut fries and italian bread is the pinnacle of bread for me would be a perfect marriage but come to find out it s just a standard marriage with room for improvement not ours dear i wanted to love this place so much hopefully it gets better all in all a great place to stop by for the nostalgia and what not but don t get your hopes and expectations in the way
  food is always decent to good always fresh and clean good taste with better quality ingredients a nice change from any fast food or the run of th mill greasy sppon joint healthier options and all around ok
  they ve changed their chicken tikka masala recipe at least twice since my original review and each time i ve liked it less the sauce used to be creamy now it looks like there s no cream in it and it separates easily so the fat floats on the top i ll have to find another restaurant to sate my chicken tikka cravings
  i don t know what is wrong with my wife but she has the worst experiences when eating burgers at burger joints strange while she may not have enjoyed herself i certainly did i had the magic mushroom burger and despite some of the magic missing it was still great tons of onions and lots of mushrooms made for a wicked good burger the fries weren t bad either but i wish they didn t serve them in a paper bag seriously for 5 you can t beat the combo deal much love to the hippies can t wait to see how the breakfast joint turns out
  i really enjoy their happy hour good drinks and good food what more can you ask for karaoke night is fun and very entertaining lol
  had dinner and appts last night was really nice the service was fantastic had a combo sushi appetizer of salmon tuna halibut that was delicious with a glass of champagne very nice experience over all
  still amazing i suggest getting a fried egg on whatever sandwich you get i dont remember what i said in my last review as far as sides but you need to get the beans if you are really hungry you could probably deal with a second side in which case i usually go with fries but i ll leave that decision up to you just promise me you will get the beans they are after all the magical fruit i love this place every time i am in town i never leave without going here
  my favorite italian restaurant in phoenix i never had a bad meal the chef is remarkable in his preparation one of my favorite dishes is the chipino crazy good on a cold day we order the spaghetti and meatball extra ball on a regular basis the antipasto salad is the best i ever had not much of a pizza guy so i won t comment on that since i never had one there but they come out of the kitchen like salmon swimming to spawn they have a bar that is conveniently placed to accommodate you with a cold beer while you wait for takeout i ve eaten at the bar a few times always a lively and friendly crowd
  pleasantly surprised i discovered alihan s while visiting pittsburgh for work and walking around downtown looking for a good lunch spot i love middle eastern mediterranean cuisine and this place caught my eye as i got closer to the entrance there was a lunch menu posted which incuded 6 lunch specials for 10 each there are several meat options to include chicken lamb beef there is also a vegetarian option i opted for the chicken shish which was accompanied with my choice of wheat bulgur fries or rice i opted for the bulgur my choice of soft drink was also included in the special there was a longer wait for the food than i anticipated maybe 20 minutes but once the food arrived i determined it was well worth the wait my meal consisted of 3 large chunks of grilled well seasoned chicken placed between 2 halves of delicious flatbread with a side of shredded lettuce chopped tomatoes and grilled bell pepper strips there was a generous portion of wheat bulgur which was positively yummy i didn t know what to expect whether the side dish would be hot cold seasoned etc the dish was served warm with an assortment of veggies and seasoned nicely the bulgur was great accompaniment to the other components of the meal there was also a side of house made tzatiki sauce this was a very good meal and a great value for just 10 i would definitely return for lunch and would also like to try the more expansive dinner menu as well
  this location is now closed unfortunate really enjoyed closest is now at tempe marketpkace
  the borscht is really good really unique don t know anywhere else in waterloo that even makes borscht the perogies were really good too and the owner gave us extra she is really nice amazing service and we were treated kindly given extra bread and sour cream when we needed it etc never had napoleon cake before and it was dope would absolutely recommend it s a really cozy and personal spot
  ate here on a recent overnight visit for work got serveral pounds of crawfish in hot and spicy i wasn t too impressed the sauce was good but the crawfish were kinda dried up and weren t juicy or slurpy at all sausage corn etc is all good we also got a couple lobsters at market price i wasn t paying so i didn t see the bill the lobsters were good better quality than the crawfish overall i can t say that this place blew me out of the water if i m up for something different then maybe this is really a 2 star review but i m giving them 3 cause their servers are great eye candy
  i freakin love this place tiny quaint and good for a date spring rolls and they are on happy hour the veggie one with the mango is my fav veg friendly sit at the bar and the cute red head will make you house shots
  i like coming here when i want some peace and quiet after hofbrauhaus it s very spacious with plenty of seating so we are always able to grab our favorite table in the back room once the place was crowded probably because the wait to get into hofbrauhaus was ridiculous but last weekend it was relatively empty with groups of people scattered about nice selection of beers though nothing that s super hard to find at another bar with a decent selection had harp strongbow etc as a bitch i get excited about their bitch drinks great chocolate martini and buttercup of course pricey for the quantity that you get 6 ish buttercup was more worth its price though had their spinach dip with pitas tasty when you seat yourself on a saturday night sometimes the wait staff will notice you and come over sometimes they don t either way it s fine since we re ok with walking to the bar to order drinks this place tries hard to be irish with the irish style roadsigns and guinness things on the walls after spending some solid hours at this place i began to think that their music collection consists solely of rock band soundtracks not that this is a bad thing but some irish songs once in a while would be interesting it also goes without being said that american sports are shown on the tvs but whatever the atmosphere is not as loud as that of a real irish pub and is more like an american sports bar with an irish theme this is actually a good place for drinking in peace rather than getting your irish on
  i can t believe i live this close and we have never been here price value and selection nobody even comes close fyi when you order the hummus one plate is good enough for 2 3 people comparing the hummus is better than at sammy s woodfire pizza which is okay to get my fix and ali babba in san diego the bread is more generous here but sammy s is better i have ate at alot of arabic restaurants so i used the places that have i like best to compare it too the tabouli is off the chain so good which is just opposite to palms casino buffet which carries alot of arabic food that borders lines offensive and is gross
  atmosphere vibe food and especially the drinks all great i had the steak and it was great this place is 30 mins from my place but i drive down to get the upstate gentleman great drink the value is great for the quality and service here this is what is call a no brainer it s gotta be in your top 3 or 4 if you live in the area
  i was excited to see this place i have been to other places with the same concept and was expecting something better i must say it was a let down the place looks like a joes crab shack the server was polite and friendly but walking into that place was walking into a morgue dead and dead with a lot of tvs and none on the vibe was dry and when i got my 1 pound of shrimp hot well it was disappointing people wrote how hot and how it burns well it did but the taste was of chill powder and cayanne the flavor was not infused and just tasted bland the tots were very good and i must say a highlight of the place i will never come back but it does have potential and with music might be fun with some ambiance it would rock food needs more time to allow flavor to sink in i wish it the best
  super delicious i had the monterrey and it was awesome at first when my wife told me about this place i was skeptical breakfast food in a crepe well i was very happy i went my crepe had bacon eggs mild serranos jack cheese and a tomato blend i paid 75 cents and had a half of a sliced avocado placed on top i miss my texas breakfast tacos and this is as close as i can get plus mimosas sampler will definitely eat here again
  ate in the lounge where you can only order appetizers all i can say is that if the abundance of an appetizer is that large that i can imagine eating a full meal took some friends from out of town and sat by the fireside and orders sliders didn t care for the cole slaw wings were wonderful and good size and small nachos the nachos had that cheese that doesn t melt and was the only reason why i couldn t give 5 stars the atmosphere is very relaxing and the servers were very knowledgable
  about 15 years ago i would stop in here to grab breakfast before heading to work a couple times a week i have noticed for sometime now that dima s tacos is still in business so i made a point to come in for breakfast to see if it was like i had remembered inside is small with only maybe 4 or 5 tables the woman who took my order was nice and gave me time to look over the menu she also told me that they were not the original owners of dima s and that it has changed hands over the years her and her husband recently started a lease so anybody familiar with dima s tacos before might notice a difference in the menu and prices since it had been so long since my last visit i just hoped for good food the prices are fair depending on what you order some menu items are made fresh and other stuff isn t my total was around 11 agua fresca this wasn t made fresh and came from a fountain machine it also tasted watered down cheese quesadilla good size and really the only thing i enjoyed it s kind of hard to mess up a cheese quesadilla bacon breakfast burrito i knew it was not going to be like i remembered dima s being all those years ago but wow it really wasn t the same the burritos used to be really big double wrapped and now they are long and skinny i don y mind since they use really big tortillas and it still ends up being a decent size the scrambled eggs were not mixed all the way before being made so i ended up with a white and yellow scramble not good there was only 2 or 3 small pieces of potato in the center and that s it the burrito could have definitely used more potato i also paid for extra cheese to be added and there was none at all the bacon tasted good but was hard at times
  i belong to a fairly large network group that comes here for breakfast every wednesday morning we have the back room for our use i ve always been happy with everything i ve ordered here i pretty much stick to the same breakfast every time and our designated server jacque who always knows what the regulars want she is amazing has the biggest heart and cares about all of her customers she has been serving the group for over 15 years and we all love her
  ate here while staying at the circus circus hotel mitch our waiter was both very knowledgable and helpful the food was on par with a restaurant of this stature but i will admit i ve had nearly as good of a prime rib at other less expensive restaurants like texas roadhouse the real value in this place is the fact that it isn t ala carte like so many restaurants in this category my bake potato came with a heaping side of bacon butter sour cream and chives which was plenty more than i needed my only real gripe is that their appetizers were seafood only which i did not care for if you are staying at the circus circus there is a coupon for a free bottle of wine at this restaurant but keep in mind the bottle they give you with this coupon retails for 5 39 at a wine store but hey it s free overall a nice steak restaurant worth going to on the strip if you have never been
  the atmosphere here is very inviting airy and open i was greeted promptly and seated right away the menu is physically large while being surprisingly limited the seafood choices are quite small actually fresh chips very light and not greasy were served hot and with three different salsas none of them are hot the habanero was disappointingly mild but your tastes may be different i ordered the vegetarian fajitas be warned the rice that is served with them is cooked in chicken stock so ask for white rice if you are a vegetarian the fajitas were very undercooked essentially just absolutely raw veggies on a hot plate i sent them back for a bit more cooking and the arrived quickly cooked properly everyone makes mistakes the tortillas were fresh and tasted good overall a good experience
  first off when you first approach the building you get the glorious smell of the smoker which is located outside if the smell wasn t inviting enough then the food will be i enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich topped with slaw of course my husband had the 2 meat combo with pulled pork brisket bbq beans and potato salad to top off our meal we had the pecan praline pudding so delicious our experience was great the staff was friendly and personable everyone greeted us upon arrival and departure as well as chatting with us before we left a major plus is it has a low key mom and pop feel the ambiance is relaxed you don t always find good ol comfort food in this big city we will definitely be back
  i know thai food and am a huge fan and this place rocks perfect flavors consistency and spice level we ordered a spice level of 10 of 10 which was perfect not too spicy the ambience is very calming and the service is top notch it is a little bit of a drive from the strip but totally worth it will be back again for sure one note they have a lot of veggie options so vegetarians rejoice
  normally have no complaints about this location but today was an almost total fail cashier wasnt friendly i was hoping to get a bag of ice and for some reason they arent able to sell ice right now so i ordered a cherry blue raspberry nerds slushie and so the problems begin first no nerds so thanks for having me pay for a product i didnt get 2nd it didnt taste like i was expecting yes it was purple which red and blue make purple so i had my partner taste it without telling him what flavor it was supposed to be and he said grape cherry and blue raspberry dont taste anything like grape s i also paid for the extra flavor that i obviously didnt get the cashier was just plain not friendly seemed like we were bothering her she handed us our drinks and said here ya go i said thank you and she just kinda looked at me so i said have a good day and then she responded while have a good one the only bright spot was the peanut butter fudge master shake my partner got said it was delicious i normally go through at least once a week for happy hour and never had any issues so thats what makes todays visit such a shock
  i decided to try this place because i d never had it and it was close to my house i was soo looking forward to some tasty shrimp and broc that is not what i got it was awful so much so that i barely ate any of it i feel like i wasted my money i will definitely not be ordering from there again
  tuesday is opposite day or is it thursday i don t know anymore i m bored with reviewing at the moment so i m going to write this as exactly the opposite of how i actually feel save for the star rating which i will rate accurately so i don t mess up the average i ll let you do the decoding delux is awful i hate that they have arrogant bastard on tap their cheeseburgers are a huge step down from applebees my personal favorite or maybe tgifridays is my favorite life is full of such difficult decisions anyway the french fries at delux remind me of deep friend cardboard flavorless and tough when my server accidentally spilled an inconsequential amount of fry sauce on my twenty dollar jeans he didn t give me 30 off oh and i hate the decor too i m not already planning to eat here this coming weekend
  we ve eaten here many times the wait staff and excellent attentive and the food is always top notch the ambiance is cool and date appropriate
  mediocre quality ingredients all farmed fish and grain fed beef the foods in the dishes just didn t really meld together and the plates that came out all had some differences from how they were listed on the menu the staff was very good the place was clean and the service was fine all the negatives lie with the food overall i wouldn t come here again had the cobb salad and the swordfish special with bacon and spinach the dressing on this salad was just terrible it was okay on its own but combined with the rest of the salad the flavors just did not work well together at all the swordfish was eh the bacon and spinach were a disappointment i have high expectations of bacon the spinach had a poor texture and flavor
  my hubby and i decided to make a quick stop somewhere to take a restroom break and of course to get something to snack on before heading back on the road to la we ve never heard of culver s so we took a chance on it since it was off the freeway it looks like a brand new location since it looks so new from the outside we find out it s a ice cream type of place with burgers and fries their sign says their known for their frozen custard which sounded pretty darn yummy despite the fact that it s so cold outside so we went in and the customer service was pretty good the young ladies would ask if we were ready to place our order and once we told her not yet she told us to take our time their interior was pretty nice and clean as well as their restroom their menu selection consisted of lots of burgers and frozen custard treats and milkshakes we ended up getting one strawberry milkshake and one brownie batter item the milkshake was pretty darn good the brownie batter was good too but i enjoyed the milkshake a lil better so if you re looking for a good fast food sweets place if you re in az be sure to check out culver s
  the people here are so nice my mom and i had the champong and jajang myun both good and inexpensive
  love love love the carpaccio never had anything else and don t want to you will not be disappointed
  i ve been here for football game brunches and for late night beers with friends and i ve always had a great experience the offer an amazing variety of beer and have decent quality food for a pub i would describe this pub as chill it not big as such but that s what gives it a very comfortable feel the nights when live music is played are the best one is more than happy sipping beer and smiling
  wow a burger what service 1st time i dined inside staff and management were superb i was in awe i don t even know what i ate they really cheered up my mood and day thanks wab
  so after the communication from management we gave wildflower another try mcclintock guatalupe the ladies at the counter were really friendly and helped us make the most of our order they obviously enjoy working with the public we ordered the hummus plate kid s linguine with pesto on the side the turkey brie sandwich an of course our son had a giant pretzel the hummus plate was great but the turkey brie was fantastic we really enjoyed our meal the best part were the four little pumpkin pie bites they brought to us i only got a tiny bite they were so good the kids gobbled them up pardon the thanksgiving pun couldn t resist the restaurant was clean with plenty of room to navigate with children the staff was friendly and in a great mood every one of them thanks for a great pre movie family meal
  wow what a great restaurant the gucamole here is absolubly crazy if you love avocado plates that have it are a must try
  i love this place the food is amazing and the service was wonderful we ordered breakfast poach egg panini cheese croissant and a butter croissant all really delicious we will revisit again when we are in montreal
  if i could give less than i would the portions were adequate but i would actually like to have some meat with my green chili taste was mediocre and i even tried breakfast with great dissapointed i m so glad the la pinata open up across the street not to mention mucho macho taco was just as dissapointing
  very stylish restaurant and bar i prefer to have drinks here or lunch dinner can be a little disappointing overall a good place to drink but would suggest eating elsewhere
  my go to place for dinner lunch or even breakfast when i go to vegas amazing prices home cooked quality meals their open 24 7 a steak meal is 9 99 comes with 2 sides a salad or soup and beer great staff as well love u ellis island
  so i have to update that while i still love some of what the spot has to offer i am sad to say that the food quality isn t as consistent as it used to be the menu has some great offerings and wonderful flavors they just don t pay quite the attention to detail that they used to for the price points they have the quality should be on point in my initial review i suggested that joe s farm grill had some new competition in town i must say that is not the case anymore the bacon used to be so crisp and now it is limp and greasy the steak sandwich once full of great cuts of meat is now met with gross amounts of fat and grizzle i will still continue to eat here as they still have some items that are usually consistent another thing that they have going for them is that they are excellent about replacing your order if you are unhappy i am hoping to see the spot make a comeback as the food they were serving when they first opened was amazing
  they do an excellent imitation of meat fish items tastes almost like real meat fish for someone like me who relatively new to veganism this is very helpful the prices are quite reasonable too given that most vegan places are usually significantly costlier
  dishes are pretty good although they tend to have more fat on their meat dishes but still decent my main complaint is most of servers have big time attitude especially the son of the owner young guy there is absolutely zero customer service in this restaurant being nice and friendly are something that they can not provide to all their customers they are probably not being treated well or maybe they are arrogant about the fact that they are the only decent filipino restaurant in the nw part of the valley
  no wait for lunch on a saturday impressive the best thing i ate here was the pho not to sound crazy but it was the best most delicious pho i have ever tried in lost wages haha but in all seriousness the buffet tasted way better this time than the first time i went in september of 2012 the desserts gelato dim sum crab legs and sushi are my go to dishes the meats and assortment of sausages were good honestly there are so many choices it s impossible to eat and try everything which is a great reason why you have to try bacchanal more than once
  the size amount and flavor of the falafels were large and delicious the salad greens should gave more chopped and less vinaigrette added however i have hadgreek food for more than 25 years and this is this best fresh tzaziki sauce i have ever had
  very good sushi but not my favorite in the valley by any means i will probably be going back in the future though at some point
  truly exceptional plate by plate chef chris is sure to delight your palette with his fantastic flavors and fresh ingredients go there just not on the days i want to go back i don t need you getting in my way
  yes the service is slow but the food is fantastic i say this while eating leftovers for breakfast so yummy great cheese selection awesome jam packed menu cool drink list i had the cheese garlic and tomato lavosh pizza i can t remember the name yum yum i put some avocado on it for breakfast this morning and it was killer go here have a snack first brush off the waitstaff because they seemed to get friendlier and friendlier as the night went on yum
  had the pastrami reuben with no cheese the sandwich was absolutely amazing i got the potato salad also that was also awesome great taste to it and i topped off the meal with a black white cookie really good nice and soft if you want a quick bite with really good food stop here i just found my new vegas sandwich shop
  i have been coming here since 1995 when i first moved to las vegas i love the deep dish chicago pizza just picked up a deep dish chicago pizza and it was delicious tim the new kitchen manager has maintained the famous rosati s sauce and crust and after coming here for now unbelievable 19 years it s comfort food at its best
  no need to discuss the food just like every other chain steak house in town or the country for that matter what makes the palm unique however is the staff s uncanny ability to act like they are doing you a favor by letting you come spend your money in their restaurant as a result of the non descript food and snotty staff we now avoid imposing on them if you want a nice dinner at a nice steakhouse go to macintosh s the food is better it is not a chain and the staff is glad you came in
  this show seems to have a little bit of an identity crisis the show was lacking in energy and did not seem to have a narrative or a point it just seemed like they did not want to be there sometimes like why is there a gloria estefan song and then an elvis song and then a glow stick dance also the description for the show says to the beats of the black eyed peas and that part was missing just why was any of it happening to as part of a luau wow but also called island heat so are they referring to cuba as an island hence the gloria estefan song i am just making this assumption because there is really no other indication for it maybe the hostess lady said something about it but the sounds is really loud and she did not enunciate very well so i may have missed something i also understand that they cannot use real fire in the show but they use glow sticks instead during certain parts but maybe they could explain that and then maybe add some reasons why it is important for certain cultures to incorporate fire into their ritualistic dance just a suggestion because honestly this show just seemed like a string of dances and musical numbers with no real tie in kind of like a talent show the dinner was very meh i liked the beginning salad and i opted for the mahi mahi yikes it was bland and over cooked it came with a side of bland rice and over steamed baby bok choy there was a little pile of mango salsa that i parceled out to try and make it tastier overall i would not recommend the show at this point it could be that they are in transition because this shows kind of seems like it is it needs a production overhaul to make it more interesting especially in the extremely competitive market of strip shows
  we stayed over in pittsburg on drive home and thanks to yelp found this place boy oh boy am i glad i have yelp this is one of the top 5 breakfasts i ve ever had i had tex mex omelette with chorizo and it was awesome son had chocolate chip and banana hot cakes and it was even better and i m not a sweet breakfast eater the chocolate was not too sweet which made for a great match with the bananas no syrup necessary i will definitely return on next trip to area may even make up a reason to come back just for pamela s there wasn t a breakfast over 7 we went tuesday at 1pm and were sat right away
  so i m stuck here for work for a week and found this nice pub not exactly my scene but the wait staff was super friendly and suggested better spots for me to check out beer selection was pretty typical and drink prices were pretty cheap considering i live in ny next time i ll try the food
  i m always rooting for coffee shops that aren t starbucks i would rather put my money into keeping quaint shops with a friendly staff in business jolta s joltacchino s are perfectly done i love the fact that they aren t frothy or watered down i have made relationships with the staff because they remind me of my favorite midwestern baristas i ve also had jolta s sandwiches and my experiences have all been positive it s always a battle between press and jolta my coffee shops away from home 4 stars bravo
  expensive food in small amount service average to poor despite the prices decor ok i was surprised at how pedestrian this restaurant is in view of the reputation of the chef i was not even impressed by desserts which i read were excellent another typical strip restaurant in las vegas more hype than value and quality of my three times there the dinner service at the bar one late night was especially bad
  don t get me wrong i love glaziers please note that this review is specifically for the steaks that are on sale they have wonderful sale items but the last few times that i bought steaks that were on sale it wasn t very tasty as a matter of fact it seemed old and tainted i don t think i will be buying any steaks here that are on sale
  great food great people great fun this place has a great atmosphere with very attentive staff and the food is cheap but doesn t skimp on quality try the philadelphia cheese steak it is amazing
  i can start by saying that this restaurant really surprised us in a great way you would never think that great food would actually come out of this place i mean it s super far from where i live let s get to the food recommended from my co worker who actually works here at night and was our server we thank you drew chutoro nigiri medium fatty tuna 4 5 actually really good i kind of only wish it was garlic ponzu sauce but very fresh albacore tataki 4 5 great flavor and i wanted like another 3 orders of this lol kumamoto oysters 5 5 so good my favorite thing tuna cocktail 5 5 the display was something amazing they put some dry ice in the liquid and the cup was smoking and the tuna was delicious spider roll and crunchy eel 4 5 really good rolls the great thing about this place is the crab they use in the rolls is snow crab great flavor only thing i can say is i wanted more eel and soft shell crab in my rolls spicy edamame 3 5 not bad not the best either sea urchin uni nigiri 5 5 super fresh hamachi kama 4 5 prepared really well and tasted great and the skin on the outside was crispy enough to eat stone places don t prepare this right but this was good salmon skin hand roll 3 5 this was probably my last favorite thing i mean don t get me wrong i ate it all and it tasted great but the bonito flakes that we re stuffed in here didn t make it awesome i would suggest a little eel sauce and less bonito thank you fried banana and chocolate lava cake dessert 5 5 this dessert was amazing it was simple with this salted caramel gelato the combo was awesome overall this is a great place if you want to bring your significant other and just want to get away from the fast life in las vegas for a night and enjoy good food and feel like your in another town when you re only 30 min from the strip
  had high hopes for trying a new place we love hibachi restaurants kids dig the flames mom dad enjoy sushi had a very very bad experience here the sushi was practically inedible the maki was prepared so large that you couldn t fit a piece in your mouth which left you either trying to bite it in half or cut it with a knife which totally defeats the purpose the sushi was placed on waaaayyyyy too much rice leaving you to pluck the fish off of the huge ball of rice our server was friendly but abandoned us for 10 minutes at a time on more than one occasion and even longer at the end of our meal when everyone was way past ready to leave for the kicker when she brought the bill an 18 gratuity was automatically added when i asked about this i was told that it s added for parties of four 4 or more i totally understand factoring in gratuities for large parties but let me tell you adding it to a family of four is pure presumption i have seldom been more dissatisfied with a dining experience
  nice to have pho available late night but the music is so loud you can t even the person across from you food is decent it was nice to make my pho to my preferred level of spicy ness pretty full bar ample amount of seating easy to locate and decent amount of parking still can t get over how loud it was though
  best cookies ever chompies has nothing on paradise s cookies and baked goods so good my siblings have me bringing them cookies from arizona to california the one and only thing i will miss in arizona is going to be paradise bakery
  chompie s is delicious i always use their call ahead so we don t have to wait since they definitely are busy on the weekends this weekend they seated our party of 13 sunday morning as soon as we got there bustling animated and fun chompie s not only offers high quality breakfasts and lunches but a dynamic fast pace for dining you may need to wait a little bit for your food since they get so busy but that s part of the experience just keep busy with the various football games displayed on their tvs throughout the restaurant it s nice too that you can walk through the restaurant and the staff gets to know who you are that sure doesn t happen at big chains personally i enjoy their coffee over ice with hazelnut creamer chompie s egg breakfast with loose scrambled eggs with american cheese on top and their everything bagel with olive pimento cream cheese their potato pancakes are incredible with sour cream and apple sauce yum gretchen is by far their best server with her 100 accuracy for orders and her charming attitude when i m traveling or on vacation i miss home since i miss out on my weekend ritual of chompie s
  there are a few things that will make me give five stars the main reason being they have some of the best pan seared scallops i ve had anywhere this is a family owned business and you can definitely tell they use fresh ingredients always a plus i had heard a lot of hype about this place but i m usually not to keen on the new hip place i hate going to newer restaurants when they re busy and just crowed with people of course that s what they want i ve had a lot of people tell me that they like places just because they re new and cool not because of the food so i was kind of nervous especially because the food here is not on the cheaper side for dinner we had new england fry clams and calamari caramelized sea scallops grass fed filet mignon side of their well known kale and anaheim pepper mac cheese i will tell you i was not disappointed with any of the dishes the clams and calamari were cooked perfectly and they weren t like rubber like you find at a lot of places around town the scallops where amazing the had this vanilla bean cauliflower puree and true sauce that really made the dish absolutely delightful the mignon was cooked perfectly as asked and have a very distinguished taste and on to my favorite the mac cheese never have i had kale in my mac cheese but my goodness it was quite a charming surprise it has a nice spicy cheese sauce from the peppers and it so was nice and creamy perfect combination they have a really nice homey feeling to the restaurant very creative decor and they have good service they were booked so if you go in when it s that busy do expect a bit of a delay definitely make a reservation before going in for dinner they also have a large variety of specialty drinks i ve heard amazing things about their chicken sandwich i m just not big on things like that for dinner soooo that means i ll be going back for lunch soon
  nothing gourmet here greasy fried food barely any crab legs i didn t eat much and i kept throwing good away cause it was nasty save your money and go elsewhere not going there again
  gotta say i love chelsea s kitchen it s sparse and loud but the service is always good and the food is excellent specifically i think they may have the best veggie burger i ve ever had the tuna tacos are almost as good when they re on the menu speaking of things that aren t on the menu they sometimes have a summer melon salad with almonds and avocado holy sh t it s refreshing and delicious but again it s never on the menu and only available seasonally so make sure you ask for it i go with jenn h all the time and her favorite is the short ribs with the fried egg on top far from kosher but extraordinary nonetheless and for what it s worth chelsea s was featuring short ribs far before it became the standard of every hip eatery across the nation overall this restaurant is a strong consistent star plus it s open late and you know i like that
  best cheese steak i ve found in phoenix and the wings are very good as well the area isn t the best and a bit hidden in a strip mall but well worth it highly recommended
  the pumpkin bread and banana bread are freshly baked and served piping hot my girlfriend and i loved this place so much we actually came back the next day for breakfast the omelettes are ridiculously huge you won t leave this place hungry at all definitely go small if you don t have a large appetite the regular sized omelettes are made with 6 eggs whereas the smalls are made with 3 4
  avoid went there on a livingsocial coupon and won t be going back the food was far below average the service was ok but by no means great the waitress seemed new and not very used to the job the place was virtually empty 3 tables total and she seemed overwhelmed the menu is definitely uninspiring if you have a diner you should at least be able to be somewhat original with the food choices definitely never again
  do not come here terrible experiences all the time hot and ready my ass the only thing that seems to be ready here is the soda in the cooler or the ranch dressing seriously everything on the menu that says hot and ready has never been available except the generic 5 dollar pizzas on occasion final nail in the coffin came tonight was told that i would need to wait 10 minutes fine an employee after 20 25 minutes asked me what i was waiting for when i let them know they informed me that they gave it away to another customer fine i was told it would come out in about 10 minutes brought the pie home and after biting into it raw dough fuck put it in the oven when we got home and gave up on the experiment the rest will go in the garbage and be transported to a landfill i would assume the one out in gilbert called up the store to tell them the situation and spoke with a manager informed him of the raw state of the dough he did offer to remake the pizza for me but i wasn t driving back i had already spent 45 minutes waiting for an under cooked pizza imagine how long it would take for a finished one being in the spirit of christmas we rewrote a christmas song for this store as sadly i can no longer endure our relationship together seeing as you no longer care about my feelings i am only out 8 bucks for the experience so life will go on it will not go on with this locations food for me sung to the tune of i ll be home for christmas cue the band i ll be home with pizza if only in my dreams
  i am not sure what the food is like but the hostess was rude and condescending we showed up at 5 10 on a monday evening we were treated to a lecture about not having reservations not once but two times by the same person if you can seat someone then do so graciously i am not there to be lectured that i did not have reservations we did not stay and we will not return the menu looks interesting but i guess you need reservations
  love this place we usually home here for lunch with friends while in the biltmore neighborhood or after a fun day of shopping their kale salad is amazing chicken finely shredded kale cashews toasted coconut omg i know it may sound a little odd but it is so good that i order the same thing every time when i m eating it i don t want it to end please don t ever take it away their roasted chicken entree is also amazing we always order the same things because we crave it nice atmosphere a brighter more modern version of houstons with the same great staff service and consistently great food parking can get busy during peak hours
  was at the sls today in search of a good lunch as it was chilly in las vegas i was craving a huge bowl of hot soup the menu at ku noodle appeared to be the answer we decided to split jumbo soups and make that lunch the congee soup was 5 star while the superior wonton was 3 the congee soup had a lovely thick texture with flawless flavor the chinese sausage and crunch water chestnuts combined truly worked we both loved it and scraped the bowl clean the superior wonton soup had nice wontons and bok choi however something was amiss with the broth and it needed to be served a few degrees hotter we had 4 star service and the prices were fair considering the fact we were at a jose andres establishment i shall most definitely return as there are many items on the menu i wish to try
  loved this place the atmosphere is so romantic and all of the staff does their best to make your time there incredible your meal includes a rose for the lady bottled water a salad made tableside a dessert tray with mini treats and chocolate covered berries and a sorbet steak wasn t the best i ve had but i m really picky the steak was very good but if this steak was served in a barn with crappy service i wouldn t be raving about this place the overall experience is what makes this place dinner for 2 was 150 with tax and tip not bad for vegas and not bad considering all that was included we left stuffed
  i ve been to several pbs in the valley they are always pretty good and very consistent i liked my mandarin orange muffin sunday morning i wish they d get with the trend and offer a green iced tea option at some point
  had the chance to stop here for lunch today the owner is very cool and showed me the goods cooking in the kitchen i felt like guy from the food network everything was fresh and the beef brisket sandwich was delicious highly recommended
  been going here for three years but they must have changed chefs recently grandchildren ordered spagetti but they refused to eat it after i tasted it i knew why the sauce tasted like tomato paste with a little spice no meat as stated on menu i had alfredo not much better no garlic or wine just bland cheese sauce on noodles chinese chicken salad the meat was fine but there was no dressing on the lettuce their menu is limited and expensive for what you get salad is not included in the more expensive meals unfortunately this restaurant is the only one in town that has ambiance they could really make this place great if they took advantage of their location with a menu that competes with chain restaurants in mesa heard their breakfast is good though should be for 10 on weekdays
  excellent food and fab service is what gets the 5 stars inside has a surf atmosphere very open with tv s everywhere menu is slightly confusing but while enjoying an appetizer we figured it out our server was courteous and friendly i had the wings and they didn t disappoint big wings wished the garlic in the parmesan was slightly stronger menu looked to offer lots to choose from will definitely return
  long line but totally worth it they had endless options for food made to order omelettes pancakes french toast bacon sausage and my favorite part was lots of fresh berries huge sweet strawberries most importantly we ordered the champagne beakfast and paid abot 60 for the two of us so it was not cheap but i left full and satisfied not to mention they served gourmet desserts for breakfast the cheese cake and tiramisu were divine
  great healthy alternative for lunch well priced for quality food the first location for this chain in charlotte
  was in town for a football game and wanted to grab some food beforehand i love greek food so hadda try this place it s nestled in a cute shopping area walking distance to univeristy of phoenix stadium we caught them on their opening day and the place was super busy we even met the owner who was very nice and welcoming ordered the gyro pita with the greek fries mmmm very very tasty and good size portions so good that we ate there again after the game 2nd time around we waited crazy long for our food but again it was their first day so i ll cut them some slack must try if you re in the area
  i thought an update was necessary considering i have been here quite a few times the last 6 months i have been slacking on my reviews or perhaps i am just not as motivated on my review updates lol well to be straight up and direct my only reason for visiting this buffet is for the crab legs the crab legs are always the star and winner of the grub session at this buffet also my friend and crab legs eating buddy really enjoys the additional and optional add on for unlimited beer wine and champagne 9 99 she can go through two or three damn bottles of white zinfandel in one sitting i have tried doing the unlimited beer and wine just once but it is just too much to eat and drink like that i can eat a lot but not on a belly full of alcohol hell no the buffet is small really not a whole lot of other options of food items they need to switch up their items it is the same buffet line every time i pretty much know in advance exactly what i will be consuming no surprise as to what will be available at the buffet i mean come on think of us locals that visit on a regular basis it s all about the crab legs i feel like a crab leg whore with every plate i devour variety is the spice of life come on harrah s i know they can do better than this i have faith
  we had a very disappointing experience today at over easy first of all the service was lousy slow and inattentive we had to remind the waiter twice to bring drinks and once to bring toast that came with my father s meal the food was equally unremarkable i had the cheddar biscuits and gravy and they were bland barely seasoned and cold my husband had the famed waffle dogs and he said they were decent but that s about it our friend had the chicken fried steak and found it lacked seasoning and the breading was sliding off of the meat she said the hash browns were the best part of the plate giving them three stars overall we will never come back to over easy again due to the service and bland average food
  improv has turley cranberry sauce and stuffing delicious get without mayo clint eastwood has fajita chicken grilled onions lettuce chipotle sauce pepper jack cheese also good but not as good as the improv which i was very skeptical of free cookie with sandwich order this place exceeded my expectations for a quick sandwich nothing to look at though
  it s a burger joint no wait it s a cocktail bar or maybe a sports bar it s all of these combined i consider m brgr to be one of the leaders in the local downtown burger scene unfortunately i can t get over the prices for the quality of food that you get there my biggest gripe is their burgers and hot dogs have too much bun sure you will have a great time there the service is great the staff are super friendly and go about explaining to you the menu if there is a canadiens game on they will have it showing my recommendation to you if this is your first time stay away from the build a burger menu it can get really expensive try one of their pre made menu burgers or maybe the burger of the day i ve gone twice to m brgr my first bill was 50 tip incl and this was for my wife and i w 2 burgers a little big zak and big zak fry basket and 2 sodas that s 25 a person for burger fries and a soda the big zak is huge be prepared to make a mess and have the bun break apart in your hands a fail in my books for a burger the fry basket is 12 and comes with french fries sweet potato fries and fried onions a la french s fried onions it s okay but a lot of fried items and you ll want to hit the gym after eating it on my second visit i wanted to treat a friend to dinner before the habs game their burger of the week was 60 pulled pork poutine atop their aaa burger cost was 17 i ordered a chili poutine a chili dog and two beers he went for a hot dog and pulled pork poutine with two beers the poutines were good i would have to say that the pulled pork was better than the chili version their pork is smoked in a smoker for a good taste and smothered in a bbq sauce the hot dogs just didn t do anything for us there is simply too much bun being served with this meal the sausage is tasty a little salty but the bun is maybe twice the size of the dog we ate the sausages total bill for that meal was 76 eat at the bar if you can the bar staff are great at not only making you a drink but striking up a conversation a side note that i forgot to mention m brgr does help the community a portion of their sales go towards the montreal children s hospital
  first time at geisha house the interior is beautiful and we were seated right away we ordered drinks i had a lychee martini and it was so good the sushi was good not fantastic but good it was about average with many other sushi restaurants our server not so great we had to keep looking for him and flag him down for drink refills and additional sushi orders the restaurant was not busy at all it was an alright experience i might be back if i happen to be in the area
  the porkbelly buns were a combination of sweet and yummy with a little salty kick to compliment it the price here is kinda expensive our tab was 400 for 16 people
  pretty good food for a buffet i m not too much into buffets but since i was in vegas and you can t leave vegas without a buffet this one was a great one to go too especially if you re tired of the vegas steak prime rib specials the seafood was fresh the food was always served hot and the wait staff was pretty prompt about making sure the tables were clean plates were taken soon after finishing a mean and the drinks were always refilled my sister actually had her wedding reception here and they did a good job accomodating us except when the wanted to seat other guests in the area my sister reserved that i felt was kind of rude a buffet is a buffet so i don t know what else to say bout it but hmmmmm deliciouso
  i was in las vegas vacationing stopped into soul food cafe loved the food best cobbler i have tasted in years hats off to the chefs great customer service friendly family atmosphere recommend the fried chicken very well seasoned top it off with a bowl of cobbler you won t be disappointed
  oh hell ya with a double fist pump in the air that s what i thought when someone handed to me a lunch menu of anna s garden hong kong cuisine it s been a long time coming vegas is in need of a good hong kong style cafe serving some yummy cantonese fare but is it too good to be true ahh yes the food offered at anna s garden is deserving of the highest honor that the cantonese language can bestow on any object that is sold yao peng yao leng translation it is cheap it is good and that my friends is the story of anna s cantonese oasis
  this food warms my soul and i m from the midwest so delicious the ceviche was amazing who knew that serving it with a room temperature potato and yam would be such a delectable combo our entrees were amazing as well ask for the special green sauce it s amazing over the rice save room for the coconut flan we are already planning our next visit to mi peru
  first impressions are first impressionas 25 min wait i ve new waiting on an hour and 45 mins this place is great food wise i hear but seriously on a mon or tues if you re telling folks only 25 mins and they re still waiting 2 hrs its pretty ridiculous get your seating system straight we table of 4 left tired of waiting tons of great restaurants just around the corner
  second time eating here and this time around no wait we were very happy because we did not have to wait we ordered the beef jerky for an appetizer the crispy duck panang and rad na the beef jerky was a lil chewy for my liking but it had great flavor especially the sauce it came with for the main entrees we ordered the crispy duck panang which was pretty amazing def will order that again the rad na was okay i wasn t a fan of the gravy will def go back to try other dishes
  it s our first time here and great food not too salty i think the star of the meal is the chashu roasted pork it s very tender and doesn t have too much fat which is great
  lots of vegetarian options and they are pretty good the 18 dinner includes a soul appetizer and entree i loved the spring roll with mango and the lemongrass peanut tofu entree very friendly staff the portions could have been a bit bigger for my taste
  wait staff nice but food quality really dropped won t be coming back especially since so many new really good crawfish restaurants have opened up
  federal pizza makes a statement once upon a time back in the madcap 80s some people had lots of money to blow on things like cocaine south african gold krugerrands and cabbage patch dolls or deposit their money in savings loan bank like institutions thanks to people like dead local crook charles keating who built the phoenician resort the scandal of savings loans cost everybody lots flash forward all the s ls went belly up one ghost of the era was the derelict federal savings loan on the corner of oregon and central avenues flash more forwarder upward projects who owns and operates area juggernaut postino whose bruschetta is great but not the best that award goes to cibo end of subject the fab windsor with an amazing crab cake sandwich and churn bought the white elephant they ve also purchased the defunct aiello s italian eatery next door poor old veteran nearby dairy queen better be afraid very afraid economists call this a monopoly hence federal pizza was born as a nod to their ancient incarnation the old s l was gutted and fashionably remodeled with reclaimed materials including a ceiling brilliantly utilizing stacks of corrugated cardboard to muffle the thumpa thumpa music the interior is light and airy in the daytime filled with business people and hipsters and intimate in the night filled with hipsters and glitterati the booths filling the center give you a spectacular stage for viewing the clientele and the open kitchen one big boon is the charming tom risner who couldn t be a better tuck trader serving investors the tlc salad 10 is a safe deposit standout with arugula spring greens beets pears smoked almonds fennel pecorino and is a sparkling choice among the five salads you can add chicken for 4 twelve very different interest drawing pizzas star on the menu each imaginatively conceived pie is 12 crafted by master baker that s baker mj coe husband of pastry artist tammie one features roasted brussels sprouts pancetta manchego cheese roasted garlic and lemon zest a variety of tastes make it a surprise but if you don t like the cruciferous sprouts you might stick with the more traditional pepperoni or four kings cheese pizza most of these brick oven babies run around 13 four prime rate sandwiches are available served on the fantastic house made bread however the porchetta with slow roasted pork loin pork belly arugula carmelized onion and lemon 10 was a bad debt fatty fatty fatty may love be your next big wave a side of crispy polenta sticks with romesco sauce 4 earned a high appraisal the former drive thru is re purposed for take away the fancy new speak for take out you won t have to dip into your christmas club account to afford federal pizza but you might want to save a few pennies here and there your account can add up fast if you re a spendthrift and you know where that got the savings loan situation
  this place was really close to my hotel and in this part of pittsburgh it s slim pickins for late night snacks and drinks in fact this was the only place still serving food past 10pm although we had to hurry as they stopped at 11pm my friend and i decided to split the tapas platter for 22 what came out was two tiny pieces of chicken for the satay two miniature hot pocket type crab wontons nickel sized short ribs and a microscopic lump of ahi tuna tartare i could get these items in bulk at trader joe s for half that price i ve dined here in the past and the meals were always good and substantial so a word to the wise if you think this is one of those establishments where you get such large apps that you could order one as a makeshift meal then you will be poor and hungry
  i am typically not a fan of the scottsdale bar scene but kazimierz in an exception they have a very chill environment which is a breath of fresh air in scottsdale it is a speak easy with the entrance located in the back there was multiple comfortable seating areas where my friend and i hung out for hours the night we went there was live music a local band which we enjoyed i love kazimierz
  great hole in the wall restaurant all you can eat dinner is not expensive the quality of the food is still awesome wide selection really great service the owner is really nice too both times i ve been here he made an effort to greet all the guests ask how their experience is going what i find unique about this place is that the owners are latinos so in some of the rolls they have a very hispanic taste when it comes to the spicy salsas they use i love it definitely will be back regularly to get my sushi fix
  i ve heard good things about this place and decided to try it but in my opinion it was overpriced and the food was just okay i had the caipirinha morango cocktail and i was very disappointed the drink was watered down and had one strawberry my friend ordered the same drink and her s was filled with strawberries i asked the waiter if i could have more he said yes but forgot and did not return overall i was not impressed with the food and service for the price and would not return
  great service decent prices awesome patio but not for fight night it s to fighty lol
  first timer from socal having father s day dinner with my dad and my family certainly not the place for anyone concerned about how they look eating in front of others cause they don t backyard family style eating with great food and service our waitress susan provided exceptional service along with the food we had the shrimp with butter garlic sauce by the pound king crab legs with the proper tools to extract the meaty contents gator nuggets yes alligator can i just say excellent and it really does taste like chicken along with clams and oysters no doubt it will be a positive experience when you have a prepared expectation to get messy side note if you wanna unplug your kids for an actual dinner this is one way my teen kids hands were too messy for them to answer their phones text etc we maintained full conversation during dinner overall great seafood dinner experience keep the positives going and when you get susan as your waitress mention she was mentioned on yelp
  maybe i came on a bad day but service was not up to par in comparison to all the other strip restaurants the best part i could say i had was probably the complimentary baguette that was given in the beginning of our dinner our server took a while but we were patient i saw a sandwich from afar and asked her what kind it is and where one could find it on the menu we missed the lunch menu but she said she would make an exception for me and order it turns out it was a steak sandwich and i didn t feel like eating steak and asked for chicken instead grilled chicken breast with brie cheese and tangy granny smith apples sounds great right it should be problem was i had too much bread going on in my sandwich or not enough filler in between my bread my eating companion got the classic steak and frites he has had his fair share of french cuisine and stated he definitely had better but it was decent all in all not sure if i would come back here next time i visit vegas
  max max max max bout damn time you opened up only for me to find out that you still have a lot of kinks to work out based on reviews and word of mouth so i was thinking a couple months should give you enough time to get your s t together fast forward to monday january 6th 7 pm dinner time 8 of us show up and are seated in a timely manner so far service seems legit we ordered garlic fried rice lechon kawali sizziling tofu chicken sisig pakbet sinigang na baboy fried bangus and of course max s fried chicken we ended our feast with buko pandan and halo halo for dessert we got our food rather quickly again service seems very good it was not until we got all our food that the i noticed our server disappeared we were enjoying our food but was wondering when we were going to get refills on all our drinks we also wanted to order dessert i would say we did not see our server for a good 15 minutes we ended up flagging another server to find out where our server was so he finally comes back to attend to our needs as i told him that we needed refills and to order dessert i smell the strong odor of cigarette smoke all over him and his breath as he acknowledged our needs dude now we know where he has been he obviously was on his break smoking pop a breath mint or 20 i hope he at least washed his hands memo to upper management or whoever is in charge of hiring and training your servers either you need to do a better job of keeping an eye on your employees or hire better servers i mean when somebody goes on break someone else is supposed to cover temporarily until that person comes back so we get our refills finally and our desserts at this point i just wanted to finish and pay up so we can get out of there overall i was actually impressed at the beginning until our server went on his break it s such a shame too because the food was 4 star worthy but the service was no better than a 2 so this is where i can justify my rating of 3 at this point in time maybe in another couple months or whenever i feel that enough time has passed for you big wigs to finally pay attention to these reviews that have a common theme and actually do something about it until then i predict your average will not go any higher than a 3 yelp 2014 365 review challenge 8
  very excited about the market by jennifer s as in i tried it this past weekend and oh i m already going back today i was excited to see that the place was packed because i want this market to be around for a long time the location is great in the complex with antique gatherings poor little rich girl and zipps right next to crudo and facing 36th street they ve taken limited exterior space and managed to make a great outdoor patio that doesn t face indian school yay inside ohemgee exposed ceiling french inspired chandeliers and cafe tables the devil is in the details and they nailed it even the water beverage bar is on a french industrial table while the order numbers for your table are made of solid wood with bold font numbers it feels provincial trendy and local at the same time i like a well designed space the service was great diners order at the counter and the food comes to you as soon as we walked in a server told us the process gave us menus and told us to make ourselves comfortable at a table while we decided this avoids a long line at the counter while we sat and looked at the menu we were served water and asked if we had questions although this is an order at the counter cafe we never had to get up to refill our water glasses the servers were on top of this for us and we did have a question which of the menu items do we try because they all sounded ridiculously good traditional lunch and dinner entrees and nosh boards we went for the molten fondue nosh board because we were on a diet i kid i kid fresh fruit locally made sausage bread and pretzel bites on a great wooden board with a small cruet of fondue it was a prefect light lunch for two and it was so good that when we finished the board i was honestly tempted to drink the few remaining drops of the fondue straight maybe they should offer this as a cocktail molten fondue neat we didn t have dessert or pastries but the looked worth the splurge last but not least the grab n go a fridge of prepared entrees that you can buy and pop in the oven at home i was excited to see entrees in a range of palates sophisticated choices for an adult get together to comfort food for the kiddos i hear the mac n cheese is so addictive you should warn your arteries my only point of contention every review has one is that they are closed two days mondays and tuesdays deal breaker nah i m hoping they re testing the waters and might compromise on one day for those of us hoping to pop in to grab an entree or two for dinner so clearly i m a fan i will probably become a norm like regular cen pho arcadia was crying for a place like this casual easy with exceptional food yay yay yay
  good place for lunch though i used to think the portion sizes were great but now me thinks they are a bit much last time i came the bbq was great just too much of a good thing though didn t feel too well after eating my philosophy is to wipe your plate clean i hate to waste food at least you know you get your moneys worth here i did try the spicy bbq sauce available at the counter and it had a good zip to it i think next time i will try the bbq sanwhich instead of the plate maybe it will be juuusssttt right sorry for sounding like goldilocks and the 3 bears
  not a good experience service was slow and not attentive food finally came out which was incomplete i ordered the beet and avocado salad which was one beet sliced the avocado was missing told waitress who brought it back with 4 slices of avocado that were completely brown and soft not edible 12 50 for a small crapy salad this place is over priced and food is sub par
  i like fuel s pizza however they have lost our business we wanted to get one of their meal deals pizza and garlic knots and asked for two slices of pizza with everything on it they said we could not get that as they were not making specialty pizzas today so we could only choose from the five they had out why they can t have customer service and give people the type of pizza on their menu is beyond me they could have easily taken the cheese pizza and added toppings to that we left and forever said goodbye to fuel customer service goes a long way and when you don t have it we will go somewhere else
  this place is located inside the golden nugget where the cafe used to be after remodeling this place is smaller than the cafe they combined cj and a bar in this space service was good food was good large portions like cj are known for i got the black tie chicken pasta it was yummy from the first bite there was a line but it went pretty fast will probably eat there again
  no bs place where you can get good decent vietnamese food i had their excellent spicy tonkinese noodle pho soup a huge bowl with garnish on the side my new death row meal lunch time place was packed with locals and vietnamese what does that tell you
  this place is great flavors are a little different than your traditional chinese but still very good so much so we ve been twice in under a week
  came here for a bday lunch for a friend only 4 or us in attendance we all ordered the lunch special of a white pizza with side cesar salad and an iced tea my companions each received their lunches and then i was advised by our server he forgot to place my order and it would only be 3 5 minutes for my pizza normally the service is good not today when my pizza finally arrived well after the rest of my party was finished eating i asked for a to go box as our lunch hour is over the waiter apologized and told me he was having it compt i was appreciative of the gesture then my bill arrived and the only item compt was the pizza and i was charged separately for my tea and side salad now i did eat the salad and drink the tea but to be charged 7 08 for a side lunch salad and iced tea is ridiculous considering the lunch special for the pizza side salad and drink for my companions was only 9 00 what a joke and i definitely will consider twice before eating at gimaldi s pizzeria again
  busy place on a friday night cool interior although i think their attempt to look authentic comes across as a bit campy still good sushi place sit right at the bar and you ll get instant service we never had a problem getting our orders to us in timely fashion the screaming orgasm was probably the tastiest of the specialty rolls we had the meat was arranged in a poke like fashion over tasty crispy noodles and tangy sauce i agree with a previous critic that they rely on sauce a little too much here but it is tasty nonetheless the jerry roll went down smoothly and the crunch roll can be addicting dynamite was very filling and a good value pick if you don t mind baked rolls for those who don t know it s a mixture of scallop and chopped shrimp baked over rice soaked in a creamy sauce they offer a huge selection of specialty rolls here but they also do nigiri the yellowtail was very thick some of the biggest pieces of nigiri i ve ever seen the squid was as well you don t have to go ayce to get a good value here especially if you re willing to try a number of their nigiri offerings we left quite full and i would gladly return
  came out the snowy cold to the most delicious moule frites mussels and fries the mussels were delicious be sure to ask for some bread to help soak it up mmmm the frites were perfectly cooked but not quite crispy enough maybe cooked a little while ago served with mayonaise of course about 16 i also had a nice but small glass of semillion chardonay for 6 i did not leave hungry i only wich i had room for creme brulee the restaurant is very nice with colorful subdued lighting the bilingual staff was excellent and friendly
  excellent food and service here we love the food and the ambiance ever since the first time we came here and met ruben we always ask for him his engaging smile and personality are an additional treat to a fine dinner and great margaritas best meals carnitas green chile and the ground beef and potato tacos and on those special occasions when it is on the menu the barbacoa is killer
  there were bubbles of soap shining on the tops of my various side dishes so i couldn t even eat my lunch
  awesome i came here while visiting cmu and i was blown away service was exemplary and the food was great i got the california club and it quite good a good casual cafe atmosphere great for studying would definitely become a regular here if i come to cmu
  there are three things that are a must for any vegas trip 1 hot sweaty dance floor action 2 titties at the rhino 3 a big fat juicy piece of meat from stripsteak as far as the steaks go my personal recommendation would be to get the 18 ounce dry aged bone in ribeye 52 its fatty flavorful and absolutely satisfying but if that s not enough for you stripsteak also offers a much larger 30oz porterhouse 69 and for those who want a little slice of heaven you can opt for the 12 oz gold label kobe steak for a whopping 85 might as well right and we all know that no steak dinner is complete without a few sides my faves include teh the scalloped potatoes and the truffled mac and cheese i would say that one side per person is about right but keep in mind that they do send over complimentary duck fat fries to get the juices flowing while you wait for you steak if you re in a rush and want your steak pronto let them know you have to catch a show and they ll throw that sucker on the grill and have it ready for you in no time oh and before you head over to mandalay make sure to hit up restaurant com for a 50 gift certificate below i have also included some eating instructions for you as soon as your steak arrives please take the following steps to ensure maximum satisfaction 1 cut your steak one bite at a time 2 do not stop eating until you have finished you entire steak fat included 3 once you finish your steak begin to eat the steak off of your dining companions plates 4 if they resist stab them in the neck with your knife then proceed to eat their steak as they bleed out
  this is a really cool place with lots of different and delicious food options there are so many potential burgers you can choose from and customize as well as lots of sushi options aside from the burgers the highlight for me was the taste explosion roll it is extremely unique and lives up to its name the downside is that this place is normally very crowded so your wait is long and they will cram you in like sardines to avoid eating dinner with complete strangers i would recommend asking to sit out back on the patio the great food and options here is worth coming back despite the crowd
  ordered the 2 chicken soft tacos so bland and dry i poured salsa all over to help but even then it wasn t so palatable i probably ate half of one of them the mexican rice was gross how do you manage that and the black beans were so salty the outside of the restaurant fools you it looks nice but inside you get really bad food drinks are soooo expensive i ordered a 12 margarita which was good but i can t imagine any margarita being worth that wish i d checked yelp before coming here wish i d gone to pizza hut instead total price of bad food an overpriced drink and decent service for one is 28 makes me sick this restaurant is in business
  last night s attempt at dining at vito s will be our last we had previously visited vito s on a consistent basis initially at least once or twice per week for drinks appetizers and or dinner at the bar while the food is only of mediocre quality the convenience offered by a location so close to home seemed to compensate for this factor as well as the cramped quarters at the bar and the seemingly perpetual presence of at least one or two loud obnoxious patrons who repeatedly made their sojourns to the parking lot only to return reeking of cigarette smoke more recently our visits became a bit less frequent due to the increasing filth present on the bar the last few times we visited we entered to find only one or two patrons at the bar but the entire rest of the bar occupied by other customers dirty dishes that had not been cleared while the staff would quickly clear enough space for us to sit down the dishes would be removed but no effort was ever made to wipe away the food that was caked to the bar glancing around however the reason for the staff s lack of attention to waiting on actual customers typically became readily apparent due to the presence of her royal majesty the owner perched in a prime booth with her entourage demanding the majority of the staff s time and efforts at the expense of the paying customers on numerous occasions we sat with empty glasses for 10 15 minutes while the staff chatted with and tended to the owner and her royal court while the convenience factor allowed us to tolerate these issues the failure of a restaurant to remain open during its posted hours is a fatal error we arrived to dine at vito s last night only to be informed by the bartender that the restaurant had closed a full 45 minutes prior to their posted time customers rely on the hours that a business states that it will be open when making plans and a failure to remain open for business until such a time presents an inconvenience significant enough that we will not burden this establishment with our patronage again vito s may not care about the time customers must waste driving to a different restaurant when they had planned on stopping in for a convenient meal but i can assure them that we will not risk the aggravation of the time wasted on a sunday evening with a long week of work looming on the horizon bye bye vito s we won t miss you
  i was in vegas for business and extended the weekend i had a business dinner here and it was fantastic my colleagues also enjoyed their meals which were short ribs fish and bolognese my caprese salad was amazing my bolognese was perfect small portion perfect sauce the wine sommelier was also helpful as we tried in vein to find a decent wine under 70 we ended up ordering something in the 80 range our waiter was superb friendly knew the entire menu and later i found out is a veteran he was outstanding to our dining experience thank you side note i returned the next night sat at the bar as my colleagues had returned home i arrived late started talking with the bartender who was one of the best bar tenders i have met in a long time showed me the difference in flavor between using citrus in a drink vs slightly singeing citrus peel before you put it in a drink very nice he talked about his upcoming tour to italy that he had won from a bartending contest and was very excited to go i stayed after closing to chat further and met the chef d cuisine who was a charming fellow foodie and whom further educated me on a few new flavors thank you so much great experience i will be back on my next trip
  this was a hit or miss dinner we had a party of eight and some dishes were good others were awful the crispy pigs tails are a must though it would probably be the only thing i would order if i went again which is unlikely
  we enjoyed a nice thursday night at cove trattoria pasta salads and canolis good amount of choices from rich and savory to light and healthy thanks deborah you were great
  great great and more great started with green papaya salad i asked for medium heat and it was plenty spicy tom yum shrimp soup was the best then i had pad thai again ask for little spicy it was perfect i will go back every time i m in vegas
  awesome view over the lake great service and prices come here every time for cross country meets
  we decided to eat here because we were staying at the luxor and didn t want to brave the heat if you have time to burn this is the place service is really slow waited 15 mins for our drinks the appetizers took 40 mins for the wings and another 10 for the mac squares out meals came out an hour and 10 after we ordered it the table behind us called the manager over to complain that they hadn t got there meal and that we order 20 mins after they did i expected the meals to be something more than ordinary but they fell short there too i will not be coming back
  amazing food horrible service the manager didn t seem to care about his poor server we complained about either
  we eat a lot of sushi being from hawaii this place is top notch some of the best sushi we ve ever had love the rolls and hamachi kama we will definitely be back
  i picked up a coconut cream pie for my moms birthday the other day it was bland and really lacked flavor or any good qualities it was definitely not worth the 12 price with tax i don t think we will be back for a pie any time soon
  tried this place last sunday for our father s day cheat meal i had high hopes and was strongly craving some decent mexican seafood upon entering we noticed that there was a guy set up in the back with a laptop and some really loud speakers dj ing ranchero music i am unclear if this was because it was father s day or if this is the normal scene on weekends either way the music was so loud you cannot hear the waitress or each other we ordered a large shrimp cocktail and a shrimp quesadilla to share service time wasn t super quick but we weren t in a huge hurry so this wasn t a major issue the waitress brought us some chips and a good greenish colored salsa i am assuming it was tomatillo based a little while later we received our cocktail and our quesadilla both were ok but the shrimp in each had the mudvain still intact the cocktail was on the watery side but did contain a decent amount of shrimp albeit dirty shrimp and avocado the quesadilla was cheesy and overstuffed i picked out the shrimp with an obvious mudvain and continued to eat the quesadilla because it did have a good flavor the wait for our check was excessive and we eventually had to flag down the waitress to request the bill i am doubtful that i will eat here again but i have heard from friends that the other items on the menu are pretty good
  i was mad at myself that i had not heard of this place until today aparently it s been open since november this beautiful looking middel eastern slightly upscale atmosphere restraunt made my day i had the kafte wrap with a side of potatoes dressed in olive oil lemon juice cilantro and other spices the wrap was delicious the meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked and the tahini sauce dressing the lettuce and tomatoe inside just perfect the only complian i have is that the pita was not warm but the taste of the other ingredients is very satisfying the decour gets a lot of points they have paid a lot of attetion to detail and the tables the cahirs the bar the curtains eveything is very traditional and yet ecelectic and very good quality the location is nice and i can t wait to go back for dinner the owner knows what he s doing and how to make you feel comfortable at your first visit all in all i am glad this place opened up in uptown i can see myself going there for lunch during the work week when i crave for good food i am being told that they will have hooka s sheesha very soon and tables outside by the patio i can t wait for the weather to change and hang out at this place on friday evenings
  the best part is this place open 24 7 the service might be a little slow and cleanliness is just ok but i would drove 10 miles from my home for this place their thai food is really authentic please be careful if you like spicy because their will make it satisfy your needed i will become their regular for sure
  sushi unbelieveable awesome service impeccalbe price holy i love sushi as much as the next person but wow i can t see paying the prices they ask for it was an experience that i m happy to say been there done that unfortunately if i don t hit it big at the tables pre dinner i am not dining there i d have to sell a kidney
  on tuesday thursday or saturday as long as it s not a game day joe s half priced burgers are a power move these things are huge come with a generous portion of fries and it s really the kind of meal you should eat only half of and bring the rest home as leftovers i ve had most of the burgers without mushrooms the bob marley spazzle four twenty dick butkus and california are some of my favorites if you re not feeling fries then their mac n cheese is actually pretty good
  i am definitely a happy camper when it came to my experience last night the service was on par where we had no substantial waits between ordering drinks apps and our main course even though we didn t come for specials our waitress made sure we got every deal that could apply so we got 10 wings and a 10 free for each person at the table we had no issue getting 2 sauces per 10 wings i think i might be a traditionalist because i loved the regular hot sauce my main thought is that the wings which were boneless were way too small to be enough to feed me good thing we got sides buffalo chicken dip and the free fried pickles with checkin offer here is some tidbits the flavored tea is about 4 a glass and the glass is small and mostly filled with ice the flavoring made the tea really foamy and kind of disturbed me however it tasted good but no refills however the menu made it seem like it came with refills the waiter was cool she let us take our time and didn t ever rush us the overall experience was something that leads me to believe i could be a regular my only wish is that the boneless wings were a bit bigger
  if you are in vegas after a long night of partying this is the place to go the portions are huge and completely worth it if you are a total rewards member you get priority seating which is amazing i ordered the omelette while my friends got a chicken benedict i think and it was honestly it was delicious
  while visiting vegas i wanted to give this place a try since i have friends suggesting it to be one of the better pho joint in town unfortunately i can t seem to agree the broth is what makes it or break it it was dingy broth and all i tasted was salt the meat wasn t fresh and the little amount of noodles that they gave was over cooked just didn t do it for me
  a nice change like most of las vegas it s full of corporate coffee houses ie starbucks so it s nice to finally come to a place here that isn t a drive thru or a get them in get them out kinda of business plan with a nice two storey seating area and outside area this business lifts the regular run of the mill standards that have been a custom to in vegas with a nice selection of pastry and sweets to satisfy even the most hardcore sweet tooth this coffee house competes well with the eateries surrounding it last time i was in they had a nice acoustic band playing a little quite music it was a nice change from a cd playing the only cons i can think of is the location is it is surrounded by very popular places so grabbing a park can be quite a effort for a cup of coffee or tea
  reviews are 100 correct food is outstanding and very authentic beware that the place does not look that impressive from the outside but rest assured the food is outstanding
  i didn t think the meal was spectacular but it was fast i love the salsa and chips they put out and the at atmosphere is casual enjoyable i think in the evening it sounds like a fun place but we came for lunch
  the only thing that makes me not a 5 star fan is the price the quality is top notch and it s great but when you have to order 4 pizzas for a gathering it s like 100 again the buffalo chicken pizza is really awesome the carmelized onions make the pie it s about 25 for a large but worth it great the next day too so i look at it like it s multiple beers i also had a beer at the bar while i waited to get it to go also a theme of my reviews lately great beer selection and fun to sit at the bar and watch college football the swimmer eats a whole mighty meaty over two meals and love this for sure
  acceptable service pretty fast juicy meats and yes come here you won t ragrets it fuckingyolo
  some of the peeps at my gf s job recommended this joint so i took my girlie to check it out its a quaint location but don t let the size hinder you cuz the food is delish super friendly staff free refills on sum delicious drinks tried their tacos they were good gf loved them the burger fry s was impressive to me great special sauce on the burgers great on the fry s as arny says i ll be back
  my diagnosis of the yard is that it suffers from bipolar disorder a rare contagious variety that makes me both love and loathe it in return even in writing this review i don t know where to start or what to say from the moment you walk in to the yard there are choices culinary dropout little cleo s inside seating or outside seating your mind reels with the possibilities and you are left wondering who is this place i ve been to culinary dropout a handful of times and each experience much like the mood disorder is different great service one time horrible the next the menu itself can t even decide what it wants to be on it you have your choice of fancy meats and cheeses antipasti or you can order chicken curry you also have a selection of sandwiches and salads but if you re looking for something heartier there s always the meatloaf they ve also included a butternut squash cannelloni for good measure with such an odd variety it becomes difficult to choose something if you re indecisive or have indecisive friends and family this is a great place the food isn t bad but it s not the best either and the portions are pretty skimpy as far as the environment again not sure what the place is supposed to be so it s a little of everything they have a stage at the front of the restaurant far away from most of the seating and i feel bad for the singers and musicians i ve seen there because it s as if they re playing for no one it s an unfortunate layout my recommendation is to come here for happy hour or for a little nosh while you watch the game and be sure to take your lithium before entry
  i was visiting scottsdale for business and my local cousins took me to poncho s for dinner this is their favorite mexican restaurant in the area i tried the sampler with a presidential theme good variety of the mexican dishes available i enjoyed each piece of the plate and the addition of a large marg made it even better i have it on his authority that the pollo fondito is awesome why only 4 and not 5 slow to non existent service at the front and really short handed waitstaff
  after a few long hours of shopping we were famished along the way home my husband pointed out habanero s he said he wanted to try it so off we went the establishment was very clean when we stepped foot inside the cashier was very helpful and answered any questions we had prices are very reasonable and portions are big our total for our meals with three drinks only came out to 30 it s definitely a step up from roberto s item s ordered fish burrito carne asada burrito 2 carne asada tacos chicken taquitos meal the taquitos meal came with a side of rice and beans there were 5 taquitos which was surprising because most establishments only include 3 they were topped off with lettuce cheese and guacamole the carne asada tacos were served on an average sized tortilla instead of the typical small ones and came topped with tomatoes lettuce cilantro and guacamole surprising as well since most places charge extra for guacamole carne asada burrito was huge so was the fish burrito downside they use frozen fish sticks for the fish burrito you could taste them that s the only complaint overall everything was good and had good flavor they have a good variety of self serve salsa s as well employees were very nice we came in with our two small boys and the cashier put on a movie for them to watch meanwhile we dined so thank you habanero s
  oh dotty s i knew ye when ye were a two story staple on state street the new location isn t the same but it is still wonderful big wooden booths and the perfect dark brew pub atmosphere my girlfriends and i hit it up when we are craving a big juicy burger we love the melting pot burger and the swiss and mushroom the fries are also fantastic but you have to buy them seperately my mouth is watering thinking about those fantastic burgers 5 stars
  ok so i know that pizza hut doeant have the best pizza in the world but it should at least be hot right this is now the second time that we have ordered a pizza from this location and nos is the second time that i received a severely cold pizza when it arrived at my door and we only live ten min away at most from the stores location the first time this happened we called and got a credit and figured everything would be ok the next time well we were wrong again today it happened and when we called to tell them the guy who answered the phone blamed it on the football game we ordered an hour before the game because of that reason then he said i could have another credit or i could come pick it up i shouldn t have to pick up a pizza it should be delivered hot and fresh it wasn t hot or fresh it was cold and it was 20 minutes late if you want to test your luck with this store good luck to ya
  the food here is amazing lots of sandwiches to choose from also the staff is very attentive and makes sure the customer is always first stop by today and try one of their delicious sandwiches
  first time i came here and it was great deb our server was the best she knew a lot about the menu and the varieties of draft beers she made a great recommendation for me the food was great big portions at decent prices will definitely come here again real soon
  the service was meh but the kobe burger was pretty solid not sure if the meal was worth the price medium is very very pink but lots of great flavor the skinny fries were not even close to being skinny i was expecting more shoestring and the quantity was not worth the price the milkshakes looked pretty tasty and their beer selection is pretty decent i don t think i would go out of my way to eat at this place again there are plenty of other gourmet burger joints where i would rather spend my hard earned s
  great little place a retro diner feel the burgers are very good and the cheesesteaks are awesome get a cheesesteak with cheesewiz sounds weird but that s how it s done in philly and it s soooooooooooo good the ice cream is wonderful too
  i ve eaten here a few times and i have no complaints the variety of rolls is awesome and they have so many spicy choices i also love the k pop videos they play in the restaurant
  so there is really nothing special about this place its a generic buffet nothing spectacular excpet maybe the chocolate fountain and even then the marshmellows were stale the only thing good with that is the strawberrys the food needed more flavor and the waffles were awful the topping was that suger syrup fruit so no thanks i mean i couldnt expect too much i was just wondering what the line was about and its really not that great the enviorment was hectic and riduculouse people shoving people for a steak it was just sad and annoying overall it was average excpet its true the waiters did ask us if we wanted refills like 30times and they were nice so thats a plus i guess
  it was okay for the price i would not go back the soup and salad were excellent the steak was nothing special the service was good but not great the support staff was better than the actual server although the actual server was very nice and friendly finally and most important it was loud i mean if i say i said what once to the person sitting across the table from me i said it 100 times during the meal if you are looking for a quiet restaurant to share a nice meal go to scottsdale to ruth chris i have to say i am a ruth chris fan and went here to try something new
  fatburger and in n out move over it was the weekend of cityscapes grand opening and one of the busiest places was this burger joint i came here with a friend between concerts and was amazed by how great the burgers were here s the rundown the place nice and clean however it was opened for only a few days when i went they have boxes of peanuts sitting out for you to scoop a bunch and eat while in line or sitting and enjoying your burger i m not a peanut fan but i thought it was pretty cool however they make a mess even with the crew cleaning the shells up constantly the service friendly and fast now when i went about half of phoenix was in the area because of cityscape so it did take a while to get our burgers but that was expected with a line out the door that formed in a matter of minutes i m sure on a normal day the service would be much quicker the price it s pricey yes you get a good burger and a small is the size of a normal burger anywhere else but almost 6 i felt like it was just a tad but too much however you can get almost anything you want on the burger for no additional charge i didn t get fries or a drink because of the price and i already had a pepsi in hand overall i m impressed so far five guys wins my vote as the best burger in phoenix
  i ve had mod pizza a few times and every experience has been great i love the large variety of toppings and sauces the staff seems very happy and is very helpful as well the price is good for what you get they also have a good gluten free option as well for those who cannot eat gluten overall a great restaraunt
  yes i know i am the only person on here to give them 3 stars but please hear me out for my reasoning behind all this on saturday i had made reservations for a party of two at 730pm when he arrived at 720pm it was not really busy nor was it a ghost town in there the hostess stand said it would be a moment as they got our table ready and for us to take a seat at the bar enjoy a cocktail or two and they will get us during our 30 minute wait yes maybe they were short staffed not ready yet etc which i am ok with they sat multiple tables of walk in s and a few reservations of small 2 4 tops i know this because a few sat at the bar whom we spoke to and others i over heard when i stood by the hostess stand to wait to check on my table off to a bad start anyway we had a nice table overlooking the garden down stairs in the back of the restaurant all the back waiters were very prompt and professional with regards to keeping the water glasses full serving the bread clearing the table from the right and serving from the left etc after working in this industry for years i get picky about this crap at high end restaurants the server was pretty on the ball and friendly but a little to relaxed with us yes we are young and eating at a high end restaurant i am ok with that on to the food below is a list of what we ordered and what i thought about it calamari app lightly breaded with light seasoning dipping sauce complimented it very well fillet mignon very tender and medium rare is more of rare but it is better to under cook the steak then burn the hell out of it very tender cut with your fork status sea bass parmesan crusted a little on the very fishy side for my taste which overcame the rest of the flavors cream of spinach very creamy and just was not my style girlfriend liked it though sea salt vinegar fries these shoestring cut fries were epic yes of everything i ate i was most impressed by the large basket of 10 fries warm butter cake once again this was the main reason we went here for my birthday and because the other half loves this dessert more than she loves me multiple layer chocolate birthday cake now to be honest this was what saved mastro s from getting the dreadful 2 star rating from me in my reservation i had noted birthday but no one had seemed to see it hell we even ordered desert and were half way finished with it before they brought out the cake personally did someone at the hostess stand go oops we need to send a birthday cake over to table xx immediately even though they already are half way through their dessert but to be honest they did and it truly made my otherwise mediocre dining experience in to a pleasant one overall mastros maybe i set my expectations to high and i understand you have only been open for a few months now so maybe all the bugs are still getting worked out in the words of my girlfriend it was not as good as the crystal cove ca location yet on par with the one in costa mesa ca sounds like i have to try all this again at the crystal cove location and compare granted thanks for the last minute birthday cake it was nice to see those little comments on open table actually mean something
  we were initially told about 30 min of wait time but luckily we were called with 10 min we got a table outside on the patio great ambience with music playing in the background and the amazing view of bellagio and eiffel tower we ordered nachos platter and chicken enchiladas the food was good but not great the server was so kind and we got free margarita as part of yelp checkin it s vegas what can you expect the patio table was too small and it could barely fit for 4ppl and their food
  this place was really great and we will definitely be back my wife and i went for dinner on a thurs night and we loved the food and the overall experience i had the rotisserie chicken and my wife had butternut squash enchiladas we were both very happy with the main course but the funny thing was that we really loved the house salad and the ceaser salad we got to start off strange but they were delicious the service was very good so no complaints there parking is tough but we found street parking the prices were very fair and i had a beer and the wife had a mojito which was very good we also had coffee after dinner and it was delish
  for grind i am really torn between 3 and 4 stars the inside is cute the burgers are good and big and the toppings are plentiful and unique however i think the 9 burger cost not including fries or drink or even cheese is quite high the thing that is pushing it to 4 stars is the quick takeout service for lunch and the fact that it seems to be independently owned we need more of those in vegas
  last time we ate here i rated it a 5 this time was average i ordered 2 8oz steaks a 6oz steak and a philly cheesesteak the food was average at best and the service wasn t much better the server did a great job but i probably will not go back while we were sitting outside a different waiter had the nerve to pull the heater away to his table without asking us first very rude
  when i heard they were building a jimmy johns near my house i was excited love their subs but the experience i ve had at this particular location bad they always get my order wrong and what irritated me the most is when they forget to put veggies on the sandwich that already come with the sandwich it s happened multiple times like they don t have the pics that tell you what each sandwich has on it for them to follow or they are trying to be to freaky fast that they mess up the order then the manager says they can t do anything about it don t even offer a free sandwich next time you go in or damn even a bag chips never going back they suck and bad customer service the one on 99th ave and mcdowell way better
  what a nice treat we were seated inside quickly and served quickly our server jeanine was pleasant i ordered the steel cut oatmeal and it was cooked perfectly my husband s scrambled eggs and lox was delicious we both enjoyed the coffee served in bright cheery yellow mugs our neighbors had ordered the lobster eggs benedict and the baguette french toast and loved their breakfast as well highly recommend this pleasant spot in the wynn ps had a little giggle after seeing the very professional hostesses in hot pink suits talking on secret service microphones but they were extremely efficient
  don t believe the hype this place is terrible dirty hole in the wall basic breakfast food my husband ordered a couple different plates to try one was worse than the next how do you mess up store bought hash browns and bacon they are completely unflexible with subsitutions and a little pricey for breakfast we live across the street and will not be returning
  love the romantic ambiance here we dropped in after a show for some drinks and snacks and even though all the tables were taken we had a great time at the bar great late night snack menu
  what a yummy find wandering around old scottsdale and didn t know what we wanted to eat hula s looked inviting so we stopped for lunch my shrimp tacos were awesome steve s habanero lime chicken tacos were great and not searing hot the flavors were well blended server reuben was very good and my mai tai was bueno we d come back
  we had a very enjoyable dinner tonight i had the cod fish fry and my wife had the poor man s lobster both were good though the poor man s was a bit blan the garlic potatoes were very good the atmosphere is a compelling reason to come 1855 as it is so comfort and welcoming
  the keg is a great place to go and spend a special evening with someone i ve dined there almost a dozen times and even after trying a few more well known or more expensive steakhouses i continue to go to the keg i first went to the keg when they opened tempe marketplace with my boyfriend on one of our vey first dates it s very modern and dimly lit which i love i always request a booth so i ve never had a problem with seating or being stuck in a loud section of the restaurant my experiences have always been quiet with light background music perfect for conversation because it was our first visit to the restaurant the manager sent over a complimentary shrimp cocktail which was actually really awesome because we both love shrimp cocktail the kegs shrimp cocktail comes with nice big shrimp displayed beautifully in a martini glass and we have ordered it every time since we normally get a bottle of wine the keg has a good standard selection with fair prices taking into account that you are paying for presentation and atmosphere i m a stickler for wine presentation so i love that for the most part all of the servers i ve had at the keg know what they re doing the dinner menu is simple which is nice i hate cluttered menus i always get the petite filet mignon which is wrapped in bacon i ll send a steak back if it s not done the way i asked and i ve never sent anything back while dining at the keg the service has always been excellent all the servers are friendly and know the menu well i ve never had a bad experience actually i normally have really great experiences where i save the servers name so i can request them another time all in all i would definitely recommend the keg to anyone who would like to enjoy a wonderful evening of good wine and great steaks in a modern atmosphere right here in tempe
  although panera is always good tonight was a bit of a challenge went with my sister and our parents around 6 30pm no flatbread no squash soup in trying to combine our orders into pick two batches to save us some money the employee failed to cancel a flatbread when i brought the receipt back up to their attention they immediately gave me the cash back and gave me a free pastry for their mistake food was good
  gave this a try based on other yelp reviews you know how you read about a restaurant with mixed reviews and you just hope that the reviewers with the bad reviews were really picky yeah that s what i was hoping i m here to say that the reviews weren t wrong service is definitely lacking at la catrina and one of the reasons we likely won t return when we arrived around 6 for dinner there were multiple tables on the right side of the restaurant shoved together with a bunch of kids and adults who looked to have recently been to a swim meet there were several booths in the area with kids and adults too the person seating my husband and i bypassed several empty tables on the left side of the restaurant and tried to seat us at a booth in between and right in the middle of all the kids and adults i ve got nothing against kids but why would you sit two adults who are just hoping to have a nice meal in the very center of tables with mostly kids when there are so many other tables available i asked that we move to a different area so instead of putting us somewhere quieter he just moved us to a booth on the other side of the same section noise level was pretty intense until the large groups left we tried to order beers on draft but were informed draft beer was not available for some reason so we ordered two bottled beers it took 10 minutes for us to get our beers i was in full sight of the bar so i watched as our waiter didn t even try going to the bar to get our beers until roughly the 10 minute mark when our beers were finally brought my husband had been given the wrong one the waiter was pouring out of the bottles into the glasses and my husband had to ask him to remove his hand from the label so he could confirm which beer it was he d ordered a darker beer and noticed the beer being poured was more of a light ale lager style our food wasn t memorable but it was okay salsa was really watered down and runny there are so many better mexican restaurants within a 5 minute drive that i just can t imagine why we would ever return here again
  the service was alright the guy that took my order seemed annoyed that i was there and also that i couldn t read their tiny printed menu the food was really good really authentic i grabbed some silverware and it was still dirty service is everything to me i wouldn t come back just because i hate feeling like i m an inconvenience to people working
  you must get a old fashion lazy susan cheese curds and no 30 at some point we were left alone for long periods of time and they did mess up one thing on our order but the manager came out and fixed it just gave us the wrong burger place is loud put the food is excellent
  my friends really like this place i guess i just don t like crawfish or the sound of people eating and spitting them the whole scene totally grossed me out but like i said everyone i was with ate and enjoyed i think they should expand the menu a bit and offer non fried selections to friends of people who like crawfish slurping
  is it bad to go here twice within 12 hours well the last time was like 4 in 24 hours shush i was hungry when i got there after the pool then for dinner then late nigh after the club gosh this time it was after the pool and after the club i got tuna melt both times omg that was so juicy and cheesy i am drooling just thinking about it the second time i waited in a really long line at 4am worth it
  this is one of our favorite go to places for lunch or dinner the food is always great and the portions are always large in my opinion and the menu has a lot of variety for kids and adults not to mention my husband loves the sports theme restaursnt bar with tvs and the bar entertaining the most current games i love the patio for cooler weather and it s nestled in cozy downtown chandler minutes from our house the staff are regular so it s nice to see familiar faces with great service even the owner runs food and waits tables now and then at least we think he s the owner super tall handsome blondish guy
  yum my boyfriend was very sweet to take me here during a dinner break while we were at the golden nugget we don t usually go to downtown lv but it s actually pretty cool anyway this steakhouse is great we ordered crabcake appetizer yumm it s basically all crab meat and no filler totally great the crab pieces are gigantic and plump it comes with a little sauce drizzled on the top with a few chopped tomatoes delicious i wish i could eat some right now this was probably the best thing i ate filet mignon perfectly cooked medium rare they re great cuz they verify what medium rare means to them so that no one gets something they weren t expecting australian lobster tail mmm so many times i have overcooked lobster and it just tastes so gross but this was so good dipped in butter yumm i forgot prepared but it doesn t matter au gratin potatoes just cheesy potatoes i couldn t stop eating it so good the potatoes are chopped into little pieces rather than sliced and the cheese is perfectly burnt just a little on top we also ordered the most amazing red wine per recommendation of the waiter wow it was so good it was the first time that i actually saved the cork unfortunately i can t remember what it was perhaps i drank too much we didn t have time for dessert but i m sure it would have been good or if you re here you can skip dessert and then go across the street and get some deep fried oreos to end your night if you are in downtown lv definitely stop by vic anthony s
  well after about 8 visits i am moving on to the next bar why is it so hard to find a bar where you can get great service great food and fast drinks i own a restauarant in north scottsdale and work alot so at the most 2 or 3 time a week a beer or three is needed after work i always go alone and have met some great friends at twin peaks the beer is cold that being said the girls that work there have the business all wrong i had the same problem at kilt i don t care if you wear a sweater i just want good service i usually have to clean the bar where i sit ask for a menu if i dare eat and am always getting treated like a loser they give you nasty looks have no personality and seem like its the worst place to work ever manager comes out every hour to play on the computer and talk to noone why not ask the customer how their experience is from what i can see here you will still get the dirtbags that like to throw coasters at the girls and get the dirty looks but us industry people know better we want good service and we will continue to hop until we find it one things for sure over my last 8 visits it isn t here it isn t a bad night and i won t be wasting the little time i get to be treated like this ever again best of luck to you i hope you can find better service staff because if you don t your destined to be stocking up on budweiser
  being that i m from the dirty south people point me in the direction of this little hole in the wall with pride as if its some place id like to enter i went once and then once more just to get a second feel of the place this place is so unsafe that i allow the husband to go in the day time only because he likes the catfish but no he wont go alone at night to get robbed by a common cat burglar they have some ok catfish no its not slap your mama good once inside the floors are very nasty people are selling foodstamps and knock off purses as well as cd s and these people get mad if you pass them by and don t choose to buy what they trying to sell like people with missing teeth who yell at you and beg omg its just sad and unsafe the employees are loud and unprofessional they talk about everything from sex to fighting in the store i started to text people just so they would know where i was and so they would know i was not in a safe place the inside of the store itself i could not belly so i took my little self and got back in my car and locked the door i kept texting my husband to see if he was ok once back in the car with me he was like who is your friend i looked at him like really some bum is taping on my window begging for change and u title him as my friend rolls my eyes so knowing i was safe with my husband in the car i rolled down my window and gave the man ten bucks i hated to see him hungry he said he was hungry but he smelled like he had been to fat tuesdays last monday and i know he was drunk so my husband has a bright idea to dig into his fish i yelled as he ate are you crazy start this car lets go i m not trying to get shot because you want to eat our next stop was the beauty shop once inside i told my girls about what just happen they was laughing at me telling me if you go mwm leave your coach bag at home put your money in your pocket and don t make eye contact with the men at all just hop out the car and run inside and get your food and leave i was explaining i don t want to eat from a place where its like a action packed scene from a movie when i go just to get food as i sat and ate my mwm i knew i would never be one of those ladies who was willing to make a mad dash for mwm if i ever have the stuff it will be because of my brave husband and his willingness to provide the fish or whatever else they got that i may want i give it two stars i was told the floor was dirty because it was raining
  don t you forget about me don t don t don t don t don t you forget about me simple mind don t you forget about me the breakfast club was a cult classic in the 80 s the breakfast club in scottsdale does not disappoint though not so much a classic yet they do serve a mean breakfast yum i ordered the eggs benedict while my partner ordered 2 eggs breakfast eggs benedict arnold haha peter griffin from family guy needless to say i loved a good old fashion breakfast and they did not skimp on the portions enough for 5 mischievous students hmmm like going back in time back to the 80 s where breakfast was a time to stuff your face my eggs were over easy for sure while the soft and warm hollandaise sauce gently glazed over the eggs and ham not too overpowering and just the right sweetness i had my hash extra crispy and my bacon i like them soft and chewy i added some hot sauce and i had myself a grand meal will you recognize me after eating here and gaining some weight call my name and walk on by a walk more like a run i ll need rain keeps falling rain keeps falling more like falling asleep down down down down i go simple mind don t you forget about me the place itself had a business diner yet modern feel not your typical dive diner for sure service was spot on and keep that coffee flowing enjoy
  food is usually pretty good my team eats here a lot today we ordered lunch for 5 to go and both of my 3 pc shrimp kebabs came as 2 1 4pc shrimp kebabs it was pretty tacky sending 2 nice shrimp plus a tiny pc of the 3rd i ll post the picture i posted to facebook if i can figure out how
  i may be in bizaro world but this denny s was great compared to all the cleveland denny s the decor was actually new and clean not overly packed for a saturday after hours food was out quick and it all was cooked to order i had the peaches and french toast breakfast i left satisfied and ready to sleep to catch my flight the next morning oh i forgot it is morning hope i don t miss my flight phoenix az is a place i could possibly move to also the waitress offered us a free dessert because the friend i was with did not write in his gratuity correctly after he thought it was her mistake he then realized it was his mistake wow now that s customer service
  i have heard all about this place and all of the cali locations seem to be a bit out of control with crowds so i decided to visit this location on my holiday vegas trip after doing some shopping at the premium outlets i decided to head over and check this place out since it was only about 10 min away i walked in around 5 30ish on a friday and it was pretty empty there were only about 2 3 other tables occupied score for me i had my pick of tables and booths to choose from i settled into my booth and tackled the menu i thought it was nice that they had several tvs hanging around the restaurant which worked out great for folks like me who decided to dine alone so i got right to it i ordered the 2 lbs of the king crab legs with the whole shabang medium sauce and the cajun fries i was going to order the catfish as well but thought that it would be way too much food for me i was right the crab legs and fries were a perfect dinner for me the whole shabang sauce that everyone raves about lived up to the hype it was garlicky spicy and delicious i even dipped my fries in it the fries were crispy and delicious and the cajun seasoning had just the right amount of spice to them service was pretty standard not bad but not spectacular all in all i was impressed with my first boiling crab experience i will def be sure to check out one of the locations in cali
  always yummy the steak is outstanding and the salmon isn t bad either i love this steakhouse far more than other more expensive places there can be a bit of a wait during dinner time but i don t mind because the food is always awesome the appetizers are also good especially the onion blossom
  my second time eating here while i love the flavors and fusions of food that i d never expect to go together tonight the service was too lax it was downright cold in the restaurant i am rarely cold so others much have been freezing which exaggerated the lax service i was in a hurry to eat and leave because of the discomfort it was a 70 meal for one and while delicious the service and temperature both brought the experience down til tonight this was my favorite vegas restaurant overall delicious food in an upscale modern atmosphere the short ribs are delicious and foie gras a nice mix of sweet and gamey
  seeing all these amazing reviews has me really second guessing why i turn to yelp i m not exactly sure if this is constant issue but there were flys all over just landing on around you your food which from the beginning made me question what i was doing there this taco cart really is not that great i ordered a carne asada al pastor taco the flour tortillas were obviously freshly made but lacking that special something of a homemade tortilla i ve gotten better tasting carne asada at filibertos so i m so confused why everyone is praising it my al pastor was better than my carne asada but weirdly chorizo y tasting and crispy the prices were decent the size of the tacos were also decent so better than a one star rating for me
  surprisingly good korean food for a small neighborhood place they are just seconds from my house so i go in every few weeks for some take out everything i have ever eaten here has been great the galbi is excellent all of the sides are fresh and tasty and they vary from time to time so you can try different things if you go more than once they even sell them in large jars if you want to stock up for the winter the kimchi jigae is also great hot and spicy just the way i like it even better when you have a terrible cold the best korean food i am aware of in henderson yummy think i m headed over there right now bye
  quick delivery and cannot stress enough to register for email deals because i never pay full price savings up to 50 off regular price
  clean fast and easy going service qualifies this place as good fast food in montreal salads are fairly portioned and the fish chips was more than enough for me to eat on its own i d be happy to go back here if i was in the area on my next trip into montreal
  this place has switched owners about a billion times ok maybe only four times since we moved to this neighborhood three years ago i guess it s hard to make this place work as a burger joint the veggie burger is ok but even though this place is within walking distance we d rather go somewhere else 99 of the time last time we went i had a craving for onion rings but the ones i got were burnt which made me sad i love onion rings the fries weren t that good either the menu seems to be having an identity crisis there s a lot to choose from but the food isn t outstanding or notable in any way to me but i have not had their non veggie food so maybe for meat eaters it s amazing i don t know the owner and his wife are really nice and i mean both the current owner and wife and the previous owner and wife of jimmy g s and you always get great service here which is why this place gets 3 stars they will even deliver out to your car if you call in your order
  my husband and i stopped in for lunch and we are so pleasantly surprised we live in mn and have a kona grill in our town eden prairie and we seldom go there bc the food is not all that great our server jen w was so great i am pregnant but really wanted sushi so i was looking for some compromises on the raw jen went thru the sushi menu with us and helped us customize the perfect rolls to suit our needs and wants we also split the kona chopped salad it was delish overall a lovely easy well taken care of lunch we will definitely be back thank you to the wonderful and talented sushi chefs and jen w for making it a great visit
  you might see the three stars and believe this restaurant is mediocre or average and i guess you wouldn t be too far off i have been coming to this location for years now and today i finally felt it appropriate to judge my experience s almost every time i come into this location i have to wait a ridiculous amount of time to either be seated or greeted by a server i am 23 and look young and i am often accompanied by a young child as a server i know the combination can be a deadly one tip wise but that s no excuse to provide me little to no service today 04 24 15 i walked in at about 4 00pm the bar was semi busy and the patio had plenty of room the inside of the place was deserted plenty of tables were available and i was ready to be sat and fed there was a gentlemen at the host desk on the phone he didn t look up at me he didn t acknowledge me i was patient and waited until he hung up but even after the call was ended he walked away without saying a word to me at this point i grew annoyed i looked over to my right and i saw two managers sitting in a booth both had seen me come in and both had seen this guy walk away without saying a word you d think that one of them would jump up and save the day but no they continued on with their meeting i finally approached a young lady and asked her if i was supposed to seat myself perhaps that was the case all along and i was the clueless one she assured me that i was right to wait to be seated and that she d be happy to help she eventually came by to serve myself and my little pal she was friendly competent respectful and quick she had no idea that i was a very generous tipper but today i believe i will have made her day she was not only serving us because no one else seemed interested but she was managing take out and all over the place after a while i realized that we were not even in her section she took care of us voluntarily and i respect the heck out of her for doing that the food as always is just fine it s bar food there is nothing exceptionally grand about it but it tastes good and that s what i count on had management stepped up and looked the least bit interested in their servers and clientele and had that young man said hi like he s paid to do i would have given uncle bear s 4 stars there is nothing 5 star about this place as a whole but our server deserves a shout out for sure isabel was her name i believe a skinny blonde girl i appreciate your help and your care
  we had a great meal here the service was attentive we had lobster and tuna appetizers both of which were fantastic the entrees were tasty and the dessert was yummy very conveniently located for the michael jackson one show some minor misses i found the decor strange our window side table was isolated from the dining room by the high backed eggshell shaped chairs of the booth next to us also our seating was arranged with our backs to the window which i found a bit odd
  i was seated at the counter immediately coffee arrived quickly and my order was taken as soon as i put the menu down omelet was large and tasty home fries were plentiful sever kept my coffee cup full did notice a person at the counter for five minutes that never received attention he got up and left as i would have
  for this place to be new they sure killed their first impression with me i ordered my favorite pie like i always do when i see a popeye s but this particular one was very disgusting the pie taste so old that i just threw it on the ground never again
  food 3 stars service 4 stars atmosphere 4 stars tao is the place to go when your in vegas and it s always packed with trendy fun people i really enjoy the atmosphere but i ve never been really impressed with the food if you have a few friends in town that want to experience the vegas seen for dinner and go clubbing all night than this is a great place to start if you re a real foodie who enjoys amazing food and the experience is only a small part of the dinner save your money and head to nobu
  our family has been here a handful if times some food has been great other food not so much for example the flavor and spice level if the chili seems to depend on the days chef we go back every now and then and just choose carefully but breakfast is always good
  theres 2 things i don t like about this restaurant 1 waited 57 minutes just to get to my table 2 the shirts that say legalize marinara but there are many things that out number those 2 things the servers are nice and friendly but when they are busy it seems like they rush the garlic bread is amazing maybe the best garlic bread i ever ate the lasagna was pretty good but you have to wait 1 2 an hour to get it the all you can eat pasta bowl was good like always and if you can t eat a second bowl you can just bring it home free of charge the meatball sub was huge my dad could only eat 1 2 the sub but what kind of trip is it if you don t get the pizza cookie the pizza cookie is the best dessert ever words can t describe how good this restaurant is
  gluten free allergy sensitive this is one of my faves great menu with lots of gf choices and dessert too they do not balk at any allergy requests and seem happy to do so i always get the mussels appetizer the soup no pasta and the chicken marsala it is so big i always have lunch for the next day
  love the decor love the food love the owners yes it is on the pricey side but a you are in scottsdale and b you get what you pay for the food is high quality the freshest mozzarella is used in their salads pizza etc and the desserts are outstanding the tirimisu and macaroons specifically love it i ll be back often
  their smoothie machine just wasn t having it today so they immediately gave me my money back a coupon for a free mccafe drink and a free large strawberry shake they were so nice and accommodating they re lucky it was me this happened to
  really good family owned restaurant home made tortillas waiters really knock themselves out to make sure your dining experience is everything it can be i ordered a burrito it was huge i have no small appetite and was only able to eat about 1 4 of it we ordered guacamole really yummy they make it up for you at the table we had some who like spicy some mild he made two bowls one of each my husband had chiles rellenos his yardstick by which he rates any and all mexican restaurants and gives them a full five stars knocking off a couple of stars for the following ac was off for most of our visit i don t care how good the food is if you re uncomfortable the overall experience suffers we had to relocate to another booth because we were sardined in the next table over had ample room for the 4 of us the soup they serve to everyone at the beginning of the meal reminds me of lipton noodle soup bleh
  i don t know why this doesn t get better reviews still a great breakfast especially considering the price my gf got one of their omelet creations and i got a belgium waffle with strawberries everything was very fresh and portions more than plentiful i think that the decor is a nice touch as well definitely my fave breakfast joint in vegas
  i have to say it is the best taco in town we stopped by this taco shop at 2am after clubbing it is a good hang over food the only problem is long waiting line
  this is the best burrito in charlotte in my opinion i have been to phat burrito too and was unimpressed they have more meat selections than your typical moe s chipotle qdoba etc they load the burrito up with toppings and they don t charge extra for guac yes the hot sauces they have are hot and i love it it sucks this place is uptown or else i would be a regular
  alas another fatality in this strip mall graveyard showed up there last night to find a small hand written sign on the locked door to the effect sorry for the inconvenience there was an indication that they expect to re open but then most restaurants do and since this was already the second incarnation at this location it s hard to imagine someone taking a third roll of the dice pity this area could definitely use an indian restaurant now if only people would actually eat there
  the epicurean experience is fabulous and should not be missed delicious different and entertaining the chefs are inviting and it s fun to watch this well orchestrated kitchen working get there at 5 30 and enjoy
  this place is beautiful no wonder there is always a line every time i walk by service good nothing spectacular ambiance the decor is beautiful but that s sort of vegas food tasteful but not amazing go with scallop price crowd impressive feel with good blend love the vegas crowd everyone is just out to enjoy life personal favorite ambiance and crowd worst expected a bit more from a celebrity chef my meal for two 140 final say drinks at the bar with appetizer should suffice
  better than average but not great i wouldn t choose to come here but i certainly don t mind it i came here for brunch and found the quality was pretty decent there wasn t anything really outstanding or unusual like what you d see at the buffet at bellagio but then again this one is half the price there s a good selection of foods all prepared decently well and enough turnover in the restaurant to ensure that you re not getting left with 2 hour old food like you see at some of the less frequented buffets
  ordered the special slice which i d have to say was a lot bigger than i have expected i love thin pizzas and theirs was just that they were generous on my slice with toppings i had mine to go so it was as fresh out the oven but i def would come back again and recommend to others it s not inexpensive but wasn t over priced this is a case of you get what you pay for and i enjoyed their friendly service and the pizza as well
  duh after a night in vegas you only need pho because thats the best hungover food for you and they have a sign inside to say so if you check in they give you free egg rolls which were really good because they use real meat instead of cabbage the waiter was really sweet i had some pho that was peanut butter y or thick i really don t know what i ordered i should have not gone outside the traditional pho so my bad but the portions were huge with tons of meat
  expensive and poor customer service food was terrible
  came tot his place because of the name tinoco which isn t a popular last name yet it belongs to my boyfriend and his family went here for his parents anniversary dinner when we happened to be in vegas at the same time for a conference parking is in the lot down fremont street it is charged by the hour and i think it cost us 5 total which includes walking down the fremont strip eating and walking back and looking at everything service was friendly small place to eat hidden away inside a hotel food slightly overpriced but oh well i love my lobster raviloli which came with grilled shrimp on the side the corn chowder and shrimp pasta in garlic sauce was good too the owner s wife i m assuming came over to ask us how we were doing and we ended up talking to her when she found out we were celebrating an anniversary she gave us free slices of cheesecake which was only okay due to the caramel swirl overall good service good food i don t know how the bill came out since i didn t pay but i m assuming it was about 20 per person
  don t order a salad to go from here i ve had the kale and quinoa salad in the restaurant before and it was delicious i ordered it to go and was not impressed there was a very very thin layer of kale and quinoa with massive amounts of feta which is not on the menu description and dressing i ordered it with shrimp so it came to 15 for a disgusting salad that i couldn t even eat they turned a very healthy option into a fat covered mess
  great atmosphere and great food the burgers are fantastic big fan of the barbecue bacon bleu burger don t forget to hit them up on your birthday for ten bucks off your meal
  i don t write many reviews but this place deserves zero stars the 13 cheeseburger was small and grossly overlooked i took 2 bites and sent it back best part is they took 30 off my bill and expected me to pay it don t think so go somewhere else there s a mcdonalds outside the palazzo get a burger there
  restaurant ambiance was great we went for my husband s birthday with reservations we were unable to get a table in the outdoor patio but they gave us a table close to the windows the food was only ok overall i would return
  you gotta sit down stairs order from the bar and enjoy get a sconnie beer and some brats red or white both good
  highlights great sandwiches at a great price sandwiches are more fun sized turnaround speed is alright limited seating when you find yourself in vegas there are lots of options and plenty of tourist traps waiting to inhale your wallet fortunately the earl of sandwich stands ready to relieve you of your overspending woes now the value isn t super incredible you re still paying chipotle pricing for a smaller sandwich but think of it like the snickers fun sized version of a subway sub it s more compact but still full of meat and sauce and cheese i got to try the montegu and the 1762 original both were good but i think i preferred the horseradish flavor of the 1762 big horseradish fan i am the ciabatta like bread was nicely crunchy but soft i think similar to schlotzky s and full of flavor the ratio of bread to meat to cheese sauce was good on both where no one element of the sandwich was overpowering overall very satisfying
  we had the a la acarte and sat on the other side the other side was for all you can eat with the cook your own meat grill the service was good and fast which is what you expect at most asian restaurants the bulgogi was really good i have been looking for a place that had the same taste and flavor as the one back home and this one is quite similar the only thing was the cleanliness of the restaurant it wasn t in tip top shape and i don t like eating while i have to shoo a fly away next time i may just have the order to go ohh and another thing it was a little pricey than i had expected typically you can judge at how much a restaurant will be based on looking at the restaurant i think the bulgogi was 14 a little steep
  came for pie and coffee with my lady the pie was excellent the coffee was hot and the server isaiah was superb
  finally tried them i had family in town and they had no interest in visiting the strip so we planned to do tons of local things this was one of them since out first attempt at the sliders was a complete failure and coupled with the fact that i was super anxious to try the sliders i planned to be at the location listed spring valley park on 5 8 2010 at least 30 mins ahead ok not to sound like a total geek we took our pup to the dog park while we waited so it was like a 2fer pup gets to play while we wait for the munchies i felt like i was 5 years old again when i saw the slider truck pulling up i was so excited ridiculously so we get into line and the slider guy started setting up he was really nice and even asked us how we heard about him i said yelp he was so excited when i said that because well i guess yelp is where he gets a lot of his business go yelp i also think that the truck fits the personality of the slider truck guy when you meet him you ll know what i mean so you place your order wait for your number to be called and find a place to sit luckily we were at a park so there were plenty of park benches to park our rears we ordered a total of 12 sliders for 3 people which btw is too much for 3 people i only ate 2 my son had 3 and my husband had 4 so we went home with 3 left over pep peps capreses and i don t remember what the others were because well i got too full before i could eat them lol and my brother ordered a bag of fries for all of us to share as small as the sliders are they are sooo filling they re all full of flavor and everything is made with such quality the fries are seasoned and weren t as bad as some of the reviews that i ve seen so i have a couple suggestions 1 the sliders all have such tasty sauces and kinda get all over your hands all he has are wet naps so bring a few napkins it ll assist with the clean up 2 if you have no intention of sitting in your car or parking your booty on the curb to eat your food i suggest that you bring some chairs he provides the food and service not really a place to sit lol reheat value my husband thought that they taste better the next day personally i don t i have no palette and he does um let me know who s right
  good food good service lemongrass soup perfect for the winter had the king chicken which was tasty good atmosphere overall
  over priced and the food is blah the only thing that i found good on the menu was the choco taco and those can be picked up for a couple of bucks at any convenience store
  this place has faster and better service than pho kinh do and nem nuong they provide a good portion of meat in their beef noodle soup compared to other restaurants the place is quite packed but they have enough staff that you can get faster service than other pho places recommend rib eye pho yummm
  phoenix city grille is a ok in my book great food and service we were here last friday it was my father in laws 60th bday celebration there were about 20 25 of us and yes we had reservations they actually have a private room for large parties super sweet we only had one waitress but it seemed that we were her only table while we were there she was pretty on top of things my wine glass never hit empty she took our orders and i was surprised at how fast the food came out very impressive i ordered the tilapia it had an almond i think crust with a raspberry sauce served over roasted veggies the tilapia was amazing and so were the veggies though the veggie portion was very small one more small scoop wont break the bank pcg its a cozy and dark romantic type setting
  just say no no no to ho ho ho i made the mistake of using their restroom after i had just placed my order for garlic shrimp it was dirty the sink had black dirt residue it was so filthy and the bathroom is also used as a storage facility although they had toilet seat covers in boxes they were not stocked for use i was on lunch at work and decided on the garlic shrimp w lo mein soft noodles there was very little shrimp it was mostly water chestnuts bamboo shoots and mushrooms i really think it should be named garlic mushroom because that was all it was the lo mein noodles were even horrible as they were way too salty thick and dry with zero flavor that was my first and last visit i have had some bad chinese food in the past however this really is the worst i have ever had no doubt it is an insult to associate the word gourmet in any way shape or form with this disaster of a chinese restaurant never again my mistake for not reading yelp reviews prior to visit as i have never been here before i was on lunch from work and drove by and stopped if i had read yelp first then i would have never stopped to dine here
  hot n juicy messy n delicious i love this place a bit ghetto shocking when you walk by the tables with their carnage of crawfish carcasses and other assorted shellfish we had so much fun here ordering crawfish snowcrab by the pound you pick your sauce and your spice level you can even opt for a no spice our waitress was a sweetheart and even demonstrated to us how to peel a crawfish it was my first time having them and they are a lot of work by far my favourite combination was hot n juicy mild spice snow crab the meat is so sweet tender and meaty you can remove an entire section and use it like a paintbrush with the juice so good will be back each time i m in town
  this is a wonderful mexican restaurant i love coming here and have never been disappointed by a single meal best margaritas i have ever had service is amazing
  stayed at the hotel and found this restaurant it doesn t look bad and decided to give a try the waiter was nice and friendly they are very attendant to provide me refills the prime ribs was big and juicy this place did not disappoint me
  man what a night i had about 8 friends in town and my son and i asked them to meet us at maria bonita s we were seated right a way and within a few minutes our order was taken there was only four tables seated when we arrived my son and i ordered first and within a few minutes all orders were taken i also ordered a drink from the bar after about 20 minutes meals started coming to the table still no drink from bar half way through the meal my son s and my dish still had not arrived still no drink i tried to get the waiter but he was not out by tables i finally flagged him down and he said it was coming that they were very busy again only four tables filled now finally everyone had finished meal and some of the party had to leave because they had small kids still no meal i flagged the waiter again and walked to kitchen window no one spoke english in kitchen so they did not know what i was saying the waiter finally came up and said since we order last really our dish was still being made long story short never got me dish never got an i am sorry the waiter was very rude it was his fault i think he never turned in ticket for us he would not tell me his name and kept saying he was the manager we will never go back it was also very embarrassing for my son and i to have invite our quest and to be treated that way awful place left my name and number for the owners or real manager never heard from anyone surprise surprise
  3 5 stars i like the decor was impressed when the server asked how i want my burger done med rare yet dissapointed when my burger came out well done but kinda expected it too anyway so i really didnt mind and happily munched away on it their pizza oven wasnt working i didnt mind bc i had been craving a burger anyway but then the side i chose was potato salad and they didnt have that either no biggie tho the bar was full of what must be thier regular mid day happy hour customers an older working class crowd that must work in the buildings around caps we had hoped to sit up at the bar but they had it all on lock down so we scored a high rise table instead service was good they checked on us often and we had a pitcher or beer at a reasonable price id go back again id like to try thier pizza when the oven is working of course
  can t go wrong with fried tofu roast duck and xo noodle everything is so favorable reminds me of china town honolulu
  i have loved eating at monami since my first visit the staff is always nice and helpful and the food is delicious the first time i came i had the filet mignon which was the best fillet i had tasted to date always have to munch on the bread butter carrot spread or pate try to put your name in for the patio seating at night so you can watch the bellagio water show while eating we always make it a point to have one meal at monami while in vegas breakfast dishes are also very good and the coffee is perfect
  this place is close to the house and i have been in a few times i have had the bbq chicken wrap the steak caesar wrap and the breakfast protein bowl a few times all are very good and the portions are just right i like going here to have a wholesome meal in a short amount of time
  divine pies usually surly or indifferent service even for take out i ve tried a myriad of slices here including the tennessee lemon jack daniel s pecan pie lemon meringue triple berry crumb and cherry all have been delicious from crust to filling the meringue and cream pies when ordered whole look beautiful with high topped meringue peaks and perfectly sculpted rings of cream covering the filling they even have a special sugar free apple crumb pie that has a bit of a hint of splenda fake sugar taste but otherwise very good we ve eaten at the restaurant and their regular menu is just ok nothing to write home about your standard typical american type fare of sandwiches burgers some home style dinners and a few fried selections like i said before unless you get one of the owners you probably are going to be met with an indifferent stare once you enter the store restaurant at least that s been the case when i ve been there it s worth it for the delicious pies though
  this place is absolutely amazing the ambience is trendy and and relaxing the food was delicious i had the carnitas the meat was so tender and served on the bone the margaritas here are out of this world they claim their margaritas are the best in the world and i haven t had one better i ll definitely return next time i m in vegas
  a small menu but a nice mix of choices although the food truck that inspired this restaurant is famous for its dumplings they were my least favorite of the items here although still good i loved the fabulous calamari dry cooked and so good they don t need sauce and the fried tofu crispy outside with garlic scallions and soy sauce small plates there are also four entree choices for meats served with rice and three delicious sounding salads the only menu category i didn t try
  at first i thought i was going to a restaurant that offers doughnuts and vietnamese foods then i saw that they were two different restaurants you basically have to order pay take a table number small styrofoam cup and sit yourself down place is pretty small but it was able to accommodate people who just want a quick soup or sandwich i paid 8 20 tax included for a beef pho soup there was only two choices of soups there and i was hesitant in ordering any egg rolls as i was not sure how big they would be so my 4 year old son and i waited when they server gave my order i was surprised with the size of the bowl the picture makes it look bigger than it was soup had no tendon or tripe the pho would be good for someone who never had it before i ve had better pho but surprisingly this small bowl filled me up by the way you don t get much bean sprouts like the picture in front of the restaurant size is more or a small version of saigon pho my son liked it at the end of our meal i was surprised by one of the employees or owners talking to customers it seems like the restaurant has regular customers without the great customer service i wouldn t come back here but next time i will order the sandwich that the guy next to us ordered they have a clean bathroom too so that was a plus
  the best in the city i come from the uk and we think we know curry i will just say i am in vegas at least once a year and mt everest is one of my first stops
  best sandwich in town veggie avocado add turkey and roast beef bread is fresh out the oven
  love this restaurant it s one of my regular spots now all the servers i ve had so far have all been great they have some kind of fish dinner that is to die for big portions for the price you pay i usually can t finish all of my fish but i can t avoid stuffing myself from trying i also usually get the bunny toes drink it s like a mint chocolate white russian has bailey s mint chocolate in it it s delicious
  i ve never had a bad meal here at north the service is always top rate you must not leave without getting a side of creamy polenta no seriously get the polenta zucca chips sweet savory spaghetti meatballs chef s board so simple but so well executed i love north
  the interesting things about frank lupe s are the name and the decor but other than that nothing else really stood out oh except for the chips great chips but a restaurant can not only be about chips the food was mediocre i didn t even finish my enchiladas which is rare for me didn t find it was worth the calories might be a cool place for just drinks and app s but certainly not dinner
  holy canolli this place is fantastic how have i never been here before the set up of the restaurant is very open and they piped in old school tunes frank sinatra harry james and tommy dorsey it really reminded me of artie bucco s sister restaurant the service was excellent and the staff was friendly and hospitable we even heard the owner chef yelling at the staff from the kitchen wize this fettuccine sitting owt heaar it was classic he really showed a passion for both the guests and the food i had read a few yelp reviews before i chose this place and i can only mirror what everyone else said the italian bread and focaccia with red pepper olive oil and garlic butter are amazing the spaghetti and meatballs were to die for the meatballs literally melt in your mouth i want to go back and try everything on the menu spoiler alert after the meal the owner came to our table and asked us to guess a number between 1 and 99 you get the number and dinner is free we didn t win but it was a fun game and a nice way to end the meal i will be back i am anxious to try lunch and the pizzas they are selling out the back
  tilapia tacos rule
  unpretentious and as truly italian as you will find in arizona i wasn t real hungry so i chose the steamed clams with white wine sauce it was outstanding great service with reasonable prices it is a little difficult to find your way to the parking lot but it is well worth the effort
  make reservations ahead of time otherwise you may have a very hard time getting in or get turned away even with reservations you may need to wait up to half an hour our group of 3 did but it went by quickly and we got a free drink out of it we had tarragon bison tongue amazing the sauce that it is in has some really distinct flavours duck in a can presentation is great the duck itself was delicious some people on here don t seem to have glowing reviews of it but i thought it was great the duck is cooked just right and the sauce is absolutely delicious pied du cochon this was very good i am not sure if i would order it again because i am a fan of rich full flavours and this had that but not to the level of some of the other menu items
  very happy to review this place after so many visits it may not look like much with no seating and a deli like set up but the food is something that really temps fulfills the soul first off the quality and authenticity is truly something to be admired i have always been impressed with everything i ve received my personal favorites are ahi limu ahi wasabi and ahi kimchi although the sauce base is used for most or all of the ahi poke i believe each one is still unique and nothing short of flavor come in early and they are more than happy to let you sample anything to your interest or liking when fresh product is still available around noon or so also they do military discount which is a great deal for such quality customer service is so personable and warming really makes you fee like you are walking into their home one of my favorite places for raw fish anything
  very few restaurants manage to balance price and quality as well as zen fusion very reasonable prices with excellent service and great food try the paella you will not be disappointed
  the crab bisque was odd the waiter placed a few pieces of crab on a plate and then poured the bisque onto the plate wasn t what i expected also ordered the crab stone claws and the bone in ribeye i asked for medium well and it came out rubbery crab was just alright
  this location had turned over so many different restaurants you wonder if native will make it but it does seem to have found the right type of crowd for this location have been eating at native for a long time when it was at various locations and hit the nights when they had the specials like the current tuesday 0 35 wings how can you go wrong at that price i think i liked the wings more in the past when they did not have a crust on the wings i always order the mild and the salt pepper the asiago parmesan are also good have had the pizza and burgers which are also good this is s good place to watch a game while having wings and drinks there are tv s every where and a separate dining area from the bar area located close to wangs it is very accessible with plenty of parking the staff is always helpful and friendly as long as the have the tuesday 0 35 wing night i will come back
  lately i tend to go back to a place a few times before giving a review and pizza people pub is no exception to this recent trend on my first visit i came during their opening week for a downtowner s lunch uye they had 5 specials this week on many of their pizzas and salads of course we all ordered two items and left over stuffed that particular day the salad was so tasty that i might actually be willing to admit that i liked it more than the pizza whaaat did i just say that out loud for the super bowl 2014 pizza people put out a pizza appetizer and salad buffet best pizza buffet in town i ve seen them do a pizza buffet once or twice since and it s worth every penny of the 15 or 20 per person they charge for it i ve been back for a random lunch once or twice since and the quality is always good but still not my favorite pizza in town if you love salads i would suggest you come here order a salad and leave ecstatic that you just had a fantastic salad if you re here for the pizza everyone has their own opinion and everyone seems to have their own favorite this isn t my personal favorite but i d never say no if friends wanted to go here for the random lunch or dinner happy yelping phoenix if you haven t yet picked your favorite pizza in phoenix and even if you have be sure to stop by pizza people pub
  went to lunch with my family at smashburgers first time here and was very pleased the food was great the service was exceptional the restaurant is very clean i would definitely recommend and visit again
  love this place great lunch special for pizza and a drink for 5 go there all the time and the owner is extremely pleasant
  awesome place for indian food try it you ll love it best lamb gyro in a long time
  i came here because word of mouth i ordered a half order of garlic knots a large pizza topped with sausage and mushrooms and an order of the sausage stuffed chicken wing i also tried the grilled rosemary lemonade that came with in a mason jar the garlic knots was perfect with a flavor of rosemary next time i ll order a full order the pizza tasted delicious and fresh the cheese was superb i also loved that there were puzzles toys and a chalk board for my two little girls to play with so it was very family friendly great eatery and will have to come back for more
  place was clean for the most part paid 20 for two dinner meals and two drinks we had the beef broccoli and the garlic chicken both meals were good but not great both the beef and chicken had a different texture almost like it was imitation service was a little wanting as well we got what we paid for and even that seemed a little too generous over all fair
  honestly i m very upset right now very very upset it s friday night and i wanted to get something a little nice for my parents and brother to have for dinner i drive the 20 minutes it takes me to get to this firehouse i order and the girl behind the counter tells me it ll be a 15 minute wait there was no one there but i let it slide i had no where else to be they re done on time i ll give them that but as soon i get home and give them to my family i see that they didn t even make them right i ordered a hero with no ham they put extra ham it says no ham on the receipt i ordered 2 of the cheddar briskets with no mayo the one has mayo and they forgot the cheddar and bbq sauce on the other really seriously i paid 10 a piece for those damn sandwiches i drove out of my way to get them it already took way too long for those girls to make them and they do it wrong i hope they lose their jobs this is ridiculous and unacceptable they re probably the same age as me early college years i know exactly what it s like to work in food and customer service if i had done that i wouldn t have a job right now i m never going to that location again and i m definitely calling there tomorrow to speak with the manager all you do is make sandwiches it can t be that hard to get my damn order right especially when i m far more than polite and understanding to you
  i must say the service is terrible we were a party of 7 but one of us was a baby so we bought 6 ayce lunches the quality of the food is average but the service fell far below average we would wait 15 20 minutes in between each order and they only refilled our drinks once throughout the whole meal at the end they included the tip for our 6 meals i was alright with the included tip but usually included tips for casual dining places like this establishment only charge like 12 18 included tip for fine dining but this place had an included tip of 20 for 6 people i believe they counted the baby and they didn t specify it anywhere or not anywhere convenient i left feeling ripped off especially for the service highly doubt i would return and i wouldn t recommend
  where should i begin hard to say i think i should begin by the good quite obviously the neighbourhood is looking for a place like this serving non pretentious food with a relaxed home y atmosphere and friendly staff we came to eat brunch today and the first thing i noticed was the line up at the door a tell tale sign of something there a need for though having a line up a relaxed atmosphere and a nice setting gets you a line up it doesn t guarantee you repeat and loyal customers at this point of my review if you are the owner operator or employee you might be saying to yourself what basis does this customer have to offer any criticism towards my restaurant let me answer that by saying i have been working in the restaurant hotel industry for the last 15yrs and i have seen the good and the bad your establishment falls somewhere in between now on with the not so good please take this as constructive and nothing else i am not here to bash i am writing this in the hopes that this might help your restaurant cafe have a long fruitful life the seating process was dealt with nicely we were promptly seated with a sense of urgency the table layout was a bit confusing it didn t look well organized i understand wanting the maximum of seated clients at one time but if the staff could not handle that many seated you should remove a few tables and encourage more tales being turned over our waitress took our coffee order after 10mins of being seated this should be something that s delay with as soon as the client is seated thus minimizing the perception of waiting times also let me say that a table just wanting a simple filter coffee doesn t want to wait 10 mins to get an alongee with a minimum investment for a drip coffee machine you could satisfy these clients after our order was taken i noticed the dishwasher with a cigarette non lit in his mouth in the kitchen area this should not be permitted near or around the food lit or not during the wait time for our food approx 30mins i noticed our waitress chatting with a friend at the bar and walking around aimlessly with no sense of urgency i saw some of her tables have to get up walk to the back and pay at the cash instead of at the table because of this though the other waitresses looked like they were bustling maybe we just got unlucky with our pick when the food arrived it was good the only thing not excusable was the burnt potatoes on the fritata dish not slightly burnt they were petrified and non edible the advice i could offer to shorten wait times for the food would be either invest some money into more updated kitchen equipment or construct a new condensed menu to handle the kitchens abilities i noticed the staff is working off an old 6 burner stove with 3 of these burner being taken up by a make shift steam table this leaves 3 burners for everything else this cannot suffice to feed a full restaurant in a reasonable amount of delay now let me finish by saying congratulations to own a business where there is a line up out the door for there offering is the dream for any owner operator i hate to say it though if some things are not adjusted and or invested that line up could dwindle away quickly we will be back to eat eventually and i hope to see the line up twice as long and i hope to be waiting in it to be seated again regards
  worth the triple d hype we always stop here when we drive cross country i think we ve been here 4 times total they have moved into a larger building and their competition around the corner puts a sign up across the street to lure the hungry waiting patrons away from matt s nice tactic but i will say this place is worth the wait everything is fresh real homemade doesn t get better i always get the pancakes the chop and chick is good too their home fries and coffee are great fresh preserves on fresh bread just go to there it s great
  by far the best sushi in cu i wouldn t go anywhere else service sets this place apart servers are efficient friendly and accommodating someone is always available to answer questions about the rotating rice wine sake menu fish is always fresh here and they are generous with sashimi sizes i don t think that they have the largest selection most unique rolls but the ones they have are quality and beautiful it s a small space but we ve never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table once in you will completely forget that you re in the middle of green st save for all the students around you perfect vibe and decor for the food served even the soy sauce dispensers are great
  we ve had both delivery and take out for both lunch and dinner and the food is always predictable good will definitely keep eating here and priced just right
  mitchell s has upped its game adding a 24 tap system with 20 rotating crafts the prices are reasonable for a downtown establishment and a great place to go if you are parking and walking to an event at consol or hopping the t to heinzfield or pncpark they also hired a new chef he is formerly of the urban tap and brought a new and inventive menu with him the classics that mitchell s was famous for are still here but the menu compliments the changes they made that the front of the house one final note the bar area is non smoking during the day great for business lunch or happy hour but becomes smoker friendly later in the evening highly recommend mitchell s
  their ham and bacon sandwich didn t disappoint it was delicious and different the waffle wasn t soggy at all just light and crispy and a little chewy the pumpkin waffles with whipped cream were great also the prices are very reasonable 5 99 for a sandwich i might have to go back tomorrow to try their fruit sandwich or waffle pizza
  i have found a new teharu and i am in love again i will never go back to the one on ray but i will drive the extra 15 miles anytime for this location plenty of everything no loud obnoxious crowds and the staff actually pay attention i got my tea refilled that may sound like a dumb statement but it would take me getting up and getting my own at the other location keep it up
  i just want to say again that i had another exquisite visit to the house i was invited to a bridal shower on december 29th the patio could not have been more comfortable or inviting it truly felt like we were at someone s home i was so amazed at how much i enjoyed the food i was still so stuffed as i tried to taste more of the shared pork dish only on sundays and it s accompaniments the service was stellar i would recommend hosting an event here anytime
  i ve been here twice already very impressive with the taste of their food and the environment i like their spicy intestine in hot plate
  they got two out of three orders wrong and the service was horrible it took over 20 minutes to get our check i am done with this cheesecake factory
  small plates in a hotel this sounds like a recipe for crappy food at a high price i was surprised to find the food here is really good but when you throw on the hotel prices it s getting up there with some of the big players in canada for that i had to bring the score down as it s good but you can get much better in the amazing gastronomical city of montreal for the same style of food the service is great as well as the atmosphere if you re looking to impress the ladies then this might be a place to do it otherwise i d steer clear of here for those occasions
  top notch caring staff for what they serve at all hours of the day never a let down i eat here whenever i need a cooking break now
  jolene our waitress was phenomenal food was great appetizers superb but az s loss to osu put a damper on the evening i d recommend four points for beer certainly as well as for food
  happy hour thursday 5ish party of 3 restaurant was fairly empty first timer sat on patio we ordered pomegranate and strawberry margaritas rose garden beer marguerita pizza deviled eggs and chicken nachos mind blown the deviled eggs were the best thing i ve ever tasted the chicken nachos were huge and worth every penny the pizza was good to one i ll be back for sure
  the waitress was chinese and she was so helpful and i ordered orange chicken and fried noodles i think the fried noodles is a better choice and it s pretty good and i will come there to eat more chinese food the single in the restaurant is bad i can t call in side and the wifi won t that good i suggest to eat near the door
  i ll have to agree with most of the comments it s a hit or miss the first time i ate here i was thrilled to finally have a good sit down pizzeria close to home pizza was delicious but service sucked i decided to give it a second chance but after the second time i won t be back pizza was not as good as the first time and service was still the same oh well no angelina s for me
  service was exceptional this evening and the food was awesome appreciate all the other great reviews that led us here to begin with a definite place to stop for greek food
  their poutine was the best that i have tried i also had their bbq wings it was expensive but still very delicious
  amazing we shared the pad thai holy basil chicken the papaya salad and super soup thai hot is legit
  the pizza is surprisingly good and they have rogue dead guy ale as well which is a mean feat in these ol carolinas umm anyways don t fear the potato pizza it s good and you ll like it
  well i was standing in line behind an older woman who was trying to decide what to get then her 3 friends showed up joined her cut in front of me and one of them starting grilling the poor kid behind the counter about how she knows good bbq since she s from kansas city one of the older women turned to me after about 5 minutes and said we just cut you huh it s not rynos fault i just thought it was interesting no one said anything from the staff i didn t take into account on my rating i got the pulled pork brisket mac and cheese and sweet beans the meat comes dry meaning no sauce the meat itself was not dry and extremely tasty and smokey the sauces were both good and i found myself wanting more hot sauce i got it to go overall the meat wasn t bad my only take away was that it s pulled brisket they don t advertise that i wanted a cut of brisket when i went out on my bbq lunch adventure so i was a little disappointed there the meat was priced fairly i read that the mac and cheese was pretty good so i got two small sides let me tell you they are small 2 50 for a sample sized side i can get bigger samples at cold stone that was my first knock the mac and cheese is great and i think they gave me their spicy beans instead of sweet because my mouth is still on fire while i was waiting for my food i read that the soda machines had duct tape on them which they didn t but the iced tea machine had two band aids in a x on one of the flavors yikes i don t want to see band aids while i m about to scarf down food overall the food was good i ll be back again for the meat but no sides
  one of my hands down favorite places in charlotte great food great beer great service you must try the pulled chicken sandwich with dinosaur sauce and of course the famous pretzels with beer cheese wether you feel like sitting inside or outside you re bound to have a wonderful time they ve got life sized chess connect four jenga plus a massive patio and volleyball courts outside it s all around an awesome experience
  we go here at least once a month if not more however no longer will that be the case deciding to go here for my birthday breakfast we come in and get seated in the back by the kitchen being an non average looking couple we expect that seating placement by the kitchen to be from places who really don t want us there i should of used my experience to know this was the first red flag and leave took a long time for anyone to come over to get our drinks i guess its really hard to see an odd looking couple in the back corner by the kitchen finally the manager comes over and asks if we were served yet nope so he took our drink orders and came right back with our drinks then we waited and waited and waited finely our waitress comes over and takes our orders being my birthday i was really craving crepes its something i only get on special occasions i was really excited to get them it was closer to lunch time so my husband ordered a sandwich she took our orders and left us to wait wait wait waiting bummer the service is so slow today i was in no hurry so i could wait bet those crepes are going to be great about a good 25 minutes later our waitress comes over with my husbands sandwich and before she places it on the table she informed me that there are no crepes left and will be an additional 15 minutes before they could get any more and make them wait what ran out on my birthday of all days couldn t you have told me that 45 minuets ago before we put the time in the sit there and enjoy the village inn kitchen ambiance really my husband refused his sandwich and we left so disappointed on my birthday too sigh
  you must come here if you come to vegas totally like a traditional beerhall in germany don t forget your shots you need to get spanked here this place is so much fun and the band gets you singing and enjoying your time even more you re compelled to meet your neighbors at your table and all have a great time i ll tell you this if you are in a group just get a few dishes the portions are huge and the beer steins are huge if you are with one other person get one dish forget the whole touristy stigma of a beerhall in vegas you are in vegas do it sing and drink and eat with your friends you will have the best time here
  excellent food just like their sister restaurant someburro s i was expecting table cloths and waiters there were waiters but it was definitely casual the service was great we were there at lunch on a sunday and were pleasantly surprised to find happy hour and a lunch menu in effect margaritas were tasty and on special discount for margarita day all in all very pleasant experience the only complaint i had was that the chips complimentary and passable but someburro s has better come in a little basket with a paper liner the basket was stained with old caked on salsa everywhere sides top bottom they looked dirty and i am not sure they could be cleaned someburro s is much closer to me and much cheaper for dinner so i would opt for that normally and especially at dinner
  great food great atmosphere the hawaiian ribeye is my favorite and don t for get the hot fudge sunday
  i would say this place is very nice and the customer service is top notch they have the best tapas that i had in long time the owner ryan is great he is very friendly i would suggest this place to any one who is looking for good tapas and chill and drink beer and wine i will be returning soon here
  i still think this is a great place for lunch this review is for their dinner service the porch does best with things like pizza and sandwiches relatively simple lunch food the dinner menu includes some full plate entrees it is here that everything falls apart i ordered a plate of salmon the fish itself was merely passable a little dry it was presented with some sort of eggplant goo and some stir fried greens kale i love eggplants and green vegetables but these three ingredients completely did not play well together as another reviewer also mentioned at night time the space feels a little dark and dingy as opposed to intimate and romantic the service pace was also off everything was slow but not in a well managed sort of way e g long stretch of wait time between seating and drinks being served and no the restaurant was not busy that night so the lesson i learned stick to lunch
  they are just great great food great taste simply their food is just amazing if you like the persian food you must try it
  prepare to pay 10 dollah for parking across the street unless you happen to be parked elsewhere for a concert or game not for the the girlfriends wives dressed to kill in matching sexy stilletoe heels because prepare to hobble food is usual bar and grill food ambiance is standard double jumbo tron projection tvs and multiple smaller flat screens blaring the game of the day svc is standard good for the creepy old midlife crisis men who ogle young twenty somethings dressed in mini skirt kilts and unbuttoned tight shirts food is rather decent if you send back your food to the kitchen to have it reheated or re done that usually gets the management s attention to make it right and bring it back faster otherwise prepare to wait and wait but for the average customer here just to watch a game one barely notices i never did receive my order of famous galric fries because they forgot to bring my order and the steamed clams they brought out were icy cold and shriveled to tiny black nubbins when i asked them to taste for themselves they made a face and quickly brought out a brand new batch which were plump and tasty then why did it take 45 minutes for me to get my first order i didn t even get any alcohol drink it s one of those novelty themed sports bars where a guy goes for standard brew and some mediocre chow to fill some kind of psychological void while watching a game not a romantic date place for sure and not so much fun for the family with kids either unless one takes a bunch of boys here to celebrate their bar mitzvahs i went because my love so desperately wanted to see sunday football someplace different than zipps while i desperately wanted to have gourmet food and go shopping at a mall might as well drop your man off at this sports bar which can serve as a sort of day care center while the ladies make a run to the mall otherwise one is better off to go the local sports bar unless you want to shell out extra mulah for standard food and tv fare
  i looking for jimbo or leslie or any of the old crew please email me i been eating at manda since i was 16 yrs old in the early 90s i was a regular until moving away to the phoenix area after many trips back to vegas for jimbos sushi and to see family i was sad to hear the old place was closing until a new place was found i recieved an email from crystal i believe and was told the new location we headed to vegas for some sushi i was amazed when i walked in at the new look it was beutiful after going there for a few times when we were in town me and a few friends found out the hard way they were closed some time short after life threw me a bad one and i spent almost a year in one hospital or another from az to md and now left disabled for some time so my point is i lost touch with all of them over time i was told over a year ago that jimbo was at some place on decatur but i don t remember where if you can email me if you know where i can find jimbo i would treat you to sushi i m serious miss you guys so much you all were more than food to me and were a big part of me being raised and growing up in las vegas brokenrt gmail com
  what a wonderful place to have dinner our daughter found this place because it had alot of gluten free items the people who run this place are the nicest and most genuine people you will ever meet don t be fooled by the location in a strip mall the food was absolutely to die for talk about scandinavian home cooking at its best well here it is there are some real surprise dishes well worth the wait for them to cook just like you would at grandmas house wow what a treat this place was check it out
  honestly i don t like giving out 5 star ratings all that much i most definitely end up giving them out more than i think i should but usually it s because i find the restaurants or business to be great this place is not an exception and i think they definitely deserve 5 stars we were leaving a friend s house in anthem and were hungry for some sushi we noticed a new restaurant hiroba and decided on a whim to pop in and give it a try they had not yet had their grand opening we caught them in their soft opening i still don t think they ve had the official opening yet and we are very glad we decided to give it a try we ordered the snow white roll the jackpot roll a deep fried spam roll and some oyster shooters they were all delicious on top of the food being fantastic the prices were also very reasonable the rolls were about 7 each the oyster shooters were 4 50 each and the deep friend spam roll was on 2 95 i think maybe it was 2 50 either way it was cheap and delicious in short this is a great restaurant i highly recommend this place and i will definitely be coming here again myself very soon
  sometimes you have to try another location sarasota to appreciate your own local store i love this location helpful friendly and the deep dish is heaven keep it up guys some of your colleagues can t come close to the store on ray
  okay if you re in vegas eating on a budget i would highly suggest stopping in for at least breakfast i think we paid 3 95 for eggs your choice of either ham bacon or sausage potatoes and fresh tortillas how do you go wrong with that everything tasted delicious too maybe that s because we started drinking at 6am hahaha they do have 99 cent bloody marys during breakfast too so it s definitely a smart spot for a breakfast adult beverage it can get packed in here but even so we were greeted quickly our food took a little longer to get to us but for a complete meal under 10 dollars including tip out you can t be too picky making this a pit stop every time in vegas
  best burger in phoenix they have a great beer selection too
  we went here for lunch and ordered the daily paella it was amazingly delicious and we enjoyed seeing them make it over the open fire pit the lunch menu is limited so just a warning dinner gives you all the options of the tapas
  clean fun menu authentic menu and plenty of choices the first thing i noticed when walking in was how modern open and clean the restaurant is the menu is easy to read and includes some pictures as well the restaurant uses the basic plate meal concept often found in hawaii which simply means you have your entree plus two sides this is not traditional american bbq so don t walk in with this expectation the menu like hawaii is a fusion of several asian cuisines as well as unique hawaiian items like their spam appetizer with rice and seaweed i also recommend the seaweed salad for something different it s very refreshing and delicious i ve had a couple of meals there and also enjoyed the crisp fried mahi mahi and bbq chicken the prices are reasonable but slightly higher than your average fast food joint with good reason in my opinion try it for yourself
  oh macayo you are a part of my youth and i am destine to return to you the food is predictably decent drinks are reasonable service is good
  thai restaurants and i go way back if you are looking for thai food this isn t the spot for you i give it two stars only because the pork pot stickers were decent the servicers were attentive and it was a neat ambiance ordered spicy chicken basil no bueno all the food was very bland my husband had the crispy noodles with beef the meat was chewie grisly he asked for it spicy and they brought him a side of chili paste not sure why they couldn t make it spicy for him while preparing the food i won t be returning
  i ve been to a considerable amount of sushi places in las vegas and i have to say that this one is my favorite so far they don t have ayce but it doesn t matter to me i never do that anyway if you like edamame their garlic edamame is the best one i ve had at any sushi places you must get it as far as their sushi goes i never get rolls but i always get nigiri and their fish is super fresh
  best pho ever easily the best in arizona
  this looks like a typical new york pizza joint in manhattan in brooklyn and new jersey we have tables the glass counter the ovens no space a narrow counter on the side with a couple of stools if you refuse to stand up and eat your pizza i had a plain and also a veggie the pizza was good but not great unless you re from fargo nd you can take the pizza place out of new york but you can t take the pizza it is acceptable for vegas even good for vegas but it ain t new york pizza still if you happen to find yourself at the cosmopolitan a place i absolutely adore and you re on a budget you can get a slice or two and be perfectly satisfied budget is a dirty word at some of the other restaurants up there on floor 3
  well done tasty miso ramen spicy and great service too
  can t go wrong with panera their menu is big enough and tasty enough to pretty much eat every meal here i usually just go for lunch lately i have been doing their pick two option for lunch so 1 2 salad and 1 2 a sandwich or 1 2 a sandwich and a cup of soup mix and match it was a little crowded today i thought the rain would force everyone to stay indoors so there was some jockeying going on for tables since it was also cold outside had a bowl of warm broccoli cheddar soup with half a tuna sandwich on honey wheat hit the spot
  as some one who has been coming here for years i can tell you the items on the menu are hit and miss my family loves the baked spaghetti pizzas calzones pizza muffins and eggplant parm i ve had several of there other pasta dishes eg alfredo and was not a fan you just have to know what to order from there the pizza and calzones are awesome
  best buffet and definitely worth it we went here for lunch buffet the selection was overwhelming great food the desserts were to die for service was excellent this place is a must go definitely going back next time in vegas
  if juan jaime was from mexico he would be totally embarrassed to eat what they call mexican in this tacos and tequila joint i ordered some tacos one with carne asada one with pork and one with chicken you could not make a decent taco out of these three no flavor no juiciness no taste whatsoever the black beans were dry and tasteless so was the rice juan if you can hear me please tell your people they need to educate themselves on real mexican food after all it is your name that it is at stake a good place to go and familiarize with true authentic mexican food is los reyes de la torta mexican food at its best i dare you juan to check it out
  that s some dang good coffee wow friendly staff too it s a bit expensive but they use local products and they re like the corner coffee shop so i don t mind definitely worth checking this place out
  the red chile mango steak salad is one of the top 5 best salads i have ever had if not 1 the combination of steak blue cheese spicy walnuts tomatoes and fresh chunks of mangos provides a flavor combination that is out of this world sweet spicy salty savory all it one delicious salad what could make for a better lunch the service is pretty good the cornbread is hot and the margaritas are worth every penny go there for lunch or for the bloody mary bar on saturdays only at this location or sundays their brunch menu on the weekends is also one of my favorites plus if you sign up for z tejas emails you ll get a 10 coupon to use during the month of your birthday
  finally was able to find a location around after watching all these golden corral commercials the price is pretty cheap for the amount of food you get it isn t the best i mean we are not in vegas here but not bad and a good enough variety came during lunch but wish we came around 330pm so that we could be around for the dinner menu in my opinion it is better than home town buffet luckily i came when there was no line but place was still pretty pack my niece especially love the cotton candy in her mind it is the best buffet around just because it has that definitely will be coming back
  hubert keller is an instant hit with me dwelling in san francisco for only a year and a half of my life was an increscribale twist in the direction my world headed i guess that is why i am drawn to chef s from sf i have been eyeing this place after seeing a piece on the travel channel nestled between a bunch of chic stores art galleries and bars i dug it i was totally pleased with the menu setup 4 basic burger types with all the sides sold separately on the side milkshake beer lists as well were very very detailed great touch the surroundings were causal but people seemed touristy and business suit types i would see this gem as a great place to get around midnight after one too many cocktails or after a day at moorea beach the adult pool i ordered the buffalo burger with caramelized onions bacon swiss cheese the zucchini fries and the skinny fries they are a separate charge from the burger tried the 5 beer sampler and a wheat hoegarden left a little tipsy and the perfect amount of fullness job well done burger bar
  great music good food and nice intimate ambiance love this place every time loving the band
  this place does serve some pretty good pizza the atmosphere though doesn t look all that great i do like though is that they do have pictures around the place that do scream out america any kind of pizza that you order would be good
  everything is good except the price i feel like these items are as good as the other dim sum places and don t need to be as expensive plus this hotel isn t all that either lol but on the bright side i do very much enjoy the sticky rice green tea filled dessert i also enjoyed the shrimp shumai
  i was a little worried because the place is on the fancy side and i wasn t dressed for the occasion i sat at the bar anyhow the server was so pleasant and helpful with food and wine suggestions i ordered the shrimp and chips the shrimp was huge literally the biggest i d ever had or seen in my life my friend even joked that it was fake lol also they have a house ketchup that s to die for they could totally give heinz a run for their money the food was well priced too the wine on the other hand was much more than i anticipated 11 for the glass i had at any rate i would go again but i ll be getting a cocktail this time and some ketchup to take back to nyc
  if you re looking for good indian food that cooked with soul this is the place to go everything about our experience here tonight was fabulous we ordered the lamb chops and a chicken saag spinach a great combo to share with two they provided a complimentary papadum basket for a apparently standard 15 min wait to make the chops the mint chutney was delicious and who am i to complain about complimentary papadum the chef also went out of his way to make an off the menu dish when i described a particular roti i have eaten elsewhere in the past this was spectacular even better than the naan i d say and perfect for eating with the saag spinach our waitress gena was very friendly and helpful to select our dishes the rest of the staff was courteous and attentive i m really glad to find this gem in my neighborhood the waitress spoke the absolutely truth when we initially arrived and discovered it was our first visit to the restaurant saying you will definitely come back again
  all i m going to say about this place is that i ve seen the workers multiple times in the trash area at kierland commons storing preparing food back there items included lettuce heads breads and macaroni and cheese disgusting i m not making this up unfortunately i contacted health services about this and when someone came to inspect the trash area there was no food back there i along with co workers noticed this on the daily back in high school when i worked at cold stone
  have been wanting to try this place for a long time as i love a good byob the food here was great the flat bread started was amazing fish and chips great as well the only downside here was the atmosphere on a crowded night you can be seated pretty close to other groups in my case it was a loud and obnoxious group sitting 2 feet away that being said cafe du jour in the southside still has my vote for best pittsburgh byob
  very happy with this place our server diena was really good we had a party of ten six kids four adults all with different orders our server got it perfect the food was really good value was much better than then expected i didn t care for the choice of music in the background or the gaming at its he bar restaurant was very clean we will visit again next year when we are in town i do recommend this place
  i came here twice within one week we ordered lamb curry and butter chicken with naan the first time and samosas naan 2 orders of lamb curry the latter the first time was a saturday evening and it was busy taking us close to 45 min to get our food but goodness everything was fresh i would wait that long again the curry was labeled mild but had a lot of spices and seasonings which made it great service was nice but best of all were the prices amazing meal with quality and portions but won t break the bank
  love the bagels the service is great coffee not so great but i hear that the ice coffee is good
  i came here for a large dinner with a fixed menu so i m going to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt when i say that that s probably why our food wasn t great the one highlight was definitely the moscow mule cocktail which wasn t part of the set menu delicious to start they brought out bread that was completely cold i m not sure if this is normal or not we had some hummus and pita which was ok cesar salad was ok but not very flavorful i had the corn ravioli which i thought was oddly thick in terms of the pasta itself almost as if it wasn t cooked properly the sauce and inside of the ravioli was also not impressive my boyfriend had the halibut which was pretty dry and fishy and the couscous underneath wasn t great either for dessert we had a chocolate lava cake which oddly didn t taste very strongly of chocolate i don t really want to come back and try this place without a set menu just because this experience was pretty disappointing and i know this place is pricey
  four of us tried this restaurant 11 14 15 we had been to pampas planet hollywood countless of times so it was fitting that we would compare bertolucci to it service at bertolucci was a lot better we all agreed that the meats served on our table at bertolucci were tastier and cooked just right the buffet table at bertolucci had plenty of choices the caesar salad dressing seemed to be from a bottle and the beef soup labeled erroneously as chicken soup was too salty however the chicken salad coleslaw warm chicken dishes fried corn bread on the buffet were good overall we recommend this neighborhood gem to those visiting las vegas
  sooooooooooooo glad they finally came to arizona it s a ride for us on the west side whenever we are in that area have to stop in
  our first find on yelp in montreal thank you yelp chicken with everything and more of what i read on ratings fresh slaw killer chicken and whoever is reading this get the fries its worth every calorie
  they should move the oyster bar in here
  a puppy amongst dogs i had a the chance to get to bad dog s this past saturday for lunch i can t exactly tell you why my gf and i decided to go to bad dog s maybe just looking to try something off the beaten path and not your average dog we arrived there a little after 1pm walked down into the bar and set up shop at the bar the bartender was a polite dude took our drink orders immediately had menus ready for us and was ready and willing to take our orders whenever we were ready ordered the chicken quesadillas see pics my gf ordered the bad dog burger which is basically a bacon cheeseburger see pics the quesadillas were good not great they were about what you would expect for a bar of this nature my gf s burger was tasty as i took a few huge bites the maple flavored bacon added a unique flavor for sure the bill came to 20 17 see pics which is fairly priced for the quality of burger and size of the quesadillas we received keep in mind however that fries do not come with the burger which are 2 00 extra very tasty hand cut fries it still stinks that they don t just come with the burger but oh well hey this isn t the greatest food you will ever eat the actual bar itself isn t the classiest bar you will ever hang out in not as long as you know that going in then you should be ok the service is great the food is good not great there are plenty of drink specials from day to day bad dog s only fault if you can call it that is that it doesn t do anything to distinguish itself from the many other bars in the university area sorry to say but i look at bad dog s as a puppy compared to the big dog bars in the area such as b walks picasso s taco mac hickory tavern and others
  in the new cosmopolitan hotel in las vegas lays this fast fun hideaway sushi restaraunt fried chicken too yep my friends dad got it i sampled it with the fun sauce and it was fabulous this place has gotten an award best fried chicken says the ny times oh ya and the sushi was delicious too of course
  subtle seemingly simple dishes with pleasantly complex flavors this was the best meal i had in vegas to be honest it should also be noted that i hate olives but the olive butter was it butter does it matter was surprisingly good for being made of presumably 99 mashed olives the portion sizes were good also frequently in my brief visit to vegas the dinners were just huge and felt wasteful but not here
  i do recommend this place for their great breakfast dishes and gut busting sandwiches and i like the fact that it s not a chain restaurant like about 95 of the other eateries in surprise but i really do wish the breakfast cook knew how to cook an egg i have never had a medium well egg in this place a med well egg is flipped unbroken yolk yolk cooked to have a firm but wet appearing center i hate it when the egg white is runny and the only way to get an eatable egg at archies is to order a scrambled egg or a well done egg and my last complaint about archies is that sometimes the waitresses can get a bit distracted which means the service suffers a bit don t you just hate it when they never come back for a refill on your coffee other than those two issues this is a good place to visit for a good not great breakfast
  so i use to go to yogis a lot about 3 years back and the quality of the food as well as the service has gone down sadly i also noticed the portions went down as prices went up i hate that the lunch combo price went high as well still good but just not the same
  my friend in arizona recommended curry corner after finding it via the food network app overall the experience was good but i don t think i d return if i were in the area as i ve had better indian and pakistani food we arrived on a lazy sunday afternoon close to 12 and the place was quite empty we sat at one of the few small tables against the wall and began debating what we should order we started with an order of the tikka masala fries which i d seen recommended on yelp they were good especially the portions with feta cheese but i d recommend skipping them the fries were pretty soggy which is understandable but the tikka masala sauce wasn t very flavorful or spicy i ordered the vegetarian thali a combination of 2 vegetable curries lentils rice naan yogurt and a small salad it was good though the lentils were incredibly salty the standout for me was the yogurt dip which i found really refreshing the curries were good just not outstanding still the price can t be beat for the amount of food you get my friend ordered the arabic plate which is like the thali plates in that you get two kinds of curry hers had chicken lentils biryani rice hummus instead of yogurt salad and naan i liked these curries better than my vegetarian ones personally the oddest part of our visit was watching someone presumably an employee wander back and forth between the kitchen and cleaning the outdoor windows it made me feel slightly awkward about the potential for unsanitary conditions where my food was being made i d honestly skip curry corner but it s not a bad decision
  order the fried squash crispy it s great salads are fresh green leaf with cuke and cherry tomatoes not a bowl of iceberg shreds we also love the vegetable soup and all of the homestyle vegetables
  i did go back to this place after my first review and again i had really good service like the first time i liked the fact that someone was going around asking for suggestions on how to make the place better shows that they care about their customers it was just a first bad experience i definitely want to try the rest of the menu and my favorite beer victoria on draft
  i work 8 am to 6pm monday thru saturday with no lunch break constantly busy so when i need food i need it in a timely manner these guys always seem to pull through i call there and they already know my name and address from previous orders and they are definitely always freaky fast for me thanks guys
  i ve been here once recently for a business meeting it s a small little place that can be missed if you don t slow down your driving inside it is clean and quiet i ve only got coffee here once to get some quick work done and stayed briefly the coffee wasn t memorable nor do i recall if they have a signature coffee item so until i sample a few more i like to provide another followup review the service is what you expect of an independent coffee house it s neither systematic or mechanic like starbucks this place gives a feeling of being in a mature setting where harmony is preferred opposite of sitting out in the old days at counter culture cafe at night i would come back again when i m in the area
  i ve wanted to try the pho bang for quite some time vietnamese for me is inexpensive comfort food it s a great name also pho bang so i had to check out the noise to see what s it all about pho bang is as the name suggests is a busy restaurant maybe that s where the new york portion of the name comes in entering the place i was lucky to get a table right at the front the place was packed like grand central train station at 5pm packed tables close together and servers weaving around the place serving food in a very efficient and calculated fashion if crowded spaces are busy restaurants are not your deal then this is not your restaurant as in other hellacious busy vietnamese restaurants it s about efficient service and you don t come here for a server asking hello how are you doing honey it s order your food eat pay leave and come again don t screw with the system here or come in with inflated expectations perusing the menu they had wonderful pictogram images of their dishes most items under 10 i had selected a bun noodle vermicelli dish that was grilled chicken and beef with this i shared a plate of pork based spring rolls with my brother who i ate with serving size was a bit smaller for the vermicelli as mentioned by my bro but overall quality and flavour was excellent and fresh for the noodle bowl the spring rolls were crispy and filling inside was a mix of ground pork and veg overall a solid meal meal with tax and tip for the two of us was just shy of 29 which is awesome and one of the reasons i come for vietnamese this is a busy place the food is on the upper end of good and one of the copious viet places in chinatown
  i m sorry but i don t agree with bob not at all first of all it s a country themed texas style roadhouse with that being said everything that you would expect from that kind of a place the service was impressive hubby and i went there on mother s day with our daughter and the wait time was accurate 5 10 min and they were busy the appetizer came out very very quickly and piping hot too our salad came out quickly as well and just about every single employee that we walked by said thank you for coming in have a wonderful mother s day the manager even came over to ask how our meal was and it was great food a bit pricey though but huge portions we paid 80 dollars for 2 cocktails 2 steak combo dinners and an appetizer but what we would expect from a traditional roadhouse overall wonderful experience and we will be going back there
  best pizza
  so i ve been meaning to come here because of many referrals from friends the staff was really welcoming my waitress alex was very nice and made the whole experience the food was amazing i ve been to a lot of ramen joints here in vegas and this place definitely on my top 3
  i have had better pad thai tom yum and dumplings nothing special here it was like an expensive fast food chinese place plenty of other places i would go to
  my boyfriend and i have been coming to la gourmandise for three years now since it opened i think it is a little on the expensive side for breakfast which is what we usually go there for but it s a nice treat we usually get the la gourmandise omelette which is amazing recently they ve also upgraded to larger portions so one entree really fills a person up their ingredients are always fresh and the service is friendly i ve noticed a lot of confusion about the french german mix of the cafe and we actually asked the owner about it a while back it s really his parents dream and one of them is french the mom i believe and the other is german they wanted to do a fusion of their two culture to celebrate so many happy years of married life such a sweet story
  all the seasoned food taste two kind too sweet or too spicy i love korean bbq but not in this place
  came in with my father and place was great definitely something new out there now super great service by staff as well recommend any one who is tired of the same food in vegas to check this place out
  i have eaten here in the past and the crab legs were pretty good well i guess they have gotten cheap and replaced the normal crab legs with a blue crab idk it was horrible horrible horrible i felt totally taken advantage of the rest of the food was not that good either bland no taste and just plain nasty fruit flies every where you could hardly enjoy your food even if you did like the food i normally don t go this far with reviews but this was just horrible i know it s a buffet but that does not mean you have to serve the poorest quality of food oh and to top it all of i have been double charged for this horrible meal believe me i won t be back oh and i think it s time for a upgrade this place looks old and outdated so disappointed but at least our server was nice and attentive
  awesome pizza and good pasta and the pizookie is gnarly i wish there was one in san fran
  i visited the octagon cafe during my visit to az with my fiance and we had a wonderful time we chose to sit out on the patio as it was a beautiful day and the view of the gigantic fountain is breathtaking the food is fantastic i had the chicken salad which i was told it is a homemade recipe it was delicious the iced tea is amazing as well be sure to try both flavors they have a full bar and beer on tap including stella which is one of my favs the staff are friendly and the owner jim takes time to great every one who enters and made us feel right at home if you find yourself in fountain hills do yourself a favor and check out the octagon cafe
  delicious i was pleasantly surprised to discover this poutinerie right in my neighborhood from the outside it appears quite boring and i would never have thought to go there but a friend had recommended it to me the poutine was pretty delicious and they had lots of options for adding veg and meat if that gets your wheeling turning i enjoy my poutine in the classic fashion and i thought their cheese was very good and that the portion size excellent they have a student discount and are open till 4am on weekends also they have loads of flavoured mayonnaise to choose from which i used to cover every fry not already drenched in gravy mmmm
  great atmosphere and chris w was a fantastic waiter not to mention easy on the eyes for these two texas girls looking for a local eatery the cheese plate fried green toatoes and salad that we split were awesome finally also a place that makes a good dirty martini yummy
  the restaurant is for some reason divided in two fancier upstairs we walked on unknowingly to the top floor i wanted the catfish sloppy joe but that was for the lower level service 6 10 waiters gave us the downstairs menu after asking good waiters but no single waiter was the lead this led to repeat questions one waiter told us 2 sex jokes not professional but they were funny food 7 10 catfish was fair sea bass was good ambiance 8 10 nice and relaxing cleanliness 9 10 very well kept
  best sandwiches everrr going to vegas with my best friend for the first time as 21 year olds oh heeeeyy we didn t only anticipate gambling and drinking but mostly where to eat this was number one on our list especially since we stayed at planet hollywood what i love most about their sandwiches is the bread it s so light and soo yummy i ve tried the earl s club the full montagu tuna melt surprisingly super good and i m not even a fan of tuna and the italian personal fave the italian such good sandwiches you have no idea until you actually try them and they re cheap too can t wait to go back to vegas and eat here again
  one of my favorite spots for elite burgers i usually splurge on the high end beef cuts when i go to burger bar so i can t speak to the other products i love the gourmet options available the beer selection cannot be overlooked here i know many beer snob that frequent burger bar for some unique beers they get from time to time they always seem to have something wonderful to pour
  sandwiches are good if you like healthy tasting sandwiches like i do juices are really good service even though it s just counter service is sub par just walked of of there after waiting 15 minutes for a blended coffee drink off hours mid morning 4 girls working in the back well at least one busy checking her pink cell phone i was the only person that had an order pending the cashier saw me throughout those 15 minutes and didn t bother to make sure my order was started i had to go up to the counter to ask for a status and only then did they start my drink not the first service related frustration i ve experienced but the latest i ll continue going here because it s the only healthy restaurant within walking distance of my office and the food is decent
  food was so good the greek salad was well dressed and the feta cheese was a good amount service took awhile i do understand it s a friday during lunch time 30 minute wait for a salad i definitely will come back to try their other good looking foods
  i must say i was hesitant to try out this place after reading all the reviews but since this is the only buffet place in cesar s and i had dinner voucher for this place i decided to take the risk during the holidays they had special sea food special going on which include unlimited shrimps and crab legs the seafood was fresh and delicious and for me that was a deal maker in itself in general buffet i didn t find much variety i tried dim sum average fried rice average two kind of sushi below average salad bar baked fish average and 4 different kind of potato awesome off the hook the dessert bar was another deal maker for me because it consisted of about 20 different kind of desserts i think for 27 this place is definitely worth it especially if they have seafood platter as well the server practically ignored our table hence the three stars
  this choice for indian came from others reviews on yelp so i needed give my support i am visitor from a large city with many indian cuisine places to choose what a nice surprise to experience somethng not fast food or chain when i called to confirm if reservations were required i was greeted with a friendly response of time and number in the party the location is easy to locate the wait staff was quick as was the food one the people in my party was hesitant to try a dish the prices to much for experimenting but once the rest of the items were served she promptly ordered a dish to go
  this restaurant makes you feel special the staff are very polite and nice outside area is full of flowers and quiet you may forgot that you are in the middle of down town the main dish prepared artistically and it is super delicious do not forget to have dessert there tiramisu is well made
  so we were at work trying to figure out what to eat and passed over this place a couple of times soooooooo happy we didnt i got the chinco fries and the pastrami boyger it was the best lunch ive had it was soooo good they have a lot on the menu so i will have to return a few times just to be sure aha the cashier and the cook were nice also the establishment is a little small but i will definitely be returning
  add our names to the list of we came here strictly for the poutine were not disappointed we order a large la taquies sour cream tomatoes guacamole a small straight up vegetarian poutine both with veggie gravy la taquies was delicious but i m also glad we got the classic version as well the guacamole was more of an avocado spread but i know cilantro isn t for everyone so its probably better for the masses they achieved what i thought to be the perfect ratio of cheese curds to gravy to fries there s a split right after the door to separate people ordering take out from those waiting for a table fyi they don t have a liquor license for their patio but you ll be fine get drunk off how amazing your meal is
  a great new spot if you like good music and great drinks this is the new spot in chinatown
  located in mgm grand on the famous las vegas strip this newly re opened seafood restaurant is the latest in the emeril s dynasty this place is great here are the must tries alligator balls yes i said alligator balls the frog legs sort of served buffalo style bbq shrimp also everything from the raw bar is incredible i should also mention the tropical mojito usually not my thing too sweet but this thing was on fire live it up you are in las vegas for cryin out loud
  my husband and i went here last night for dinner and i booked the restaurant only because it had outdoor seating by the wynn lake i made the reservations on opentable over a week beforehand when we got there we were told that an outside seat would be an hour wait immediately i was annoyed because this is the reason i made reservations ahead of time and i requested a seat outside i ve worked in the restaurant business if you can t guarantee outdoor seating then make a note of that on reservations sites etc or don t overbook your patio if wait had been 15 30 minutes i would have been understanding and had gone to the bar to wait but an hour wait is ridiculous poor planning in my opinion dinner was pretty good my husband and i ordered a bottle of wine and got a dozen oysters to start usually at restaurants they will explain where the oysters are from etc at a seafood restaurant i would expect that an more nope nothing if i m paying 40 for oysters i d like to know a little bit about them and since i noticed we got 2 different kinds it would have been nice to have know the difference between the two i guess i ll ask next time next my husband and i ordered the specialty whole lobster from their 4 different choices offered they bring live lobsters to your table beforehand and explain where each one is from and the price per pound my husband got the scottish blue 160ish total for 2 5lbs and i went with the classic maine 100 2 5lbs we opted for the chili rub food arrived beautifully prepared butter came on a warming dish but flame underneath was not lit so butter got cold quickly my husband s lobster was perfect but mine had a little surprise waiting i started with the tail and once i started cutting into it there was a massive amount of slimey black dark green ooze coated on the inside of the tail the lighting was dim so i kind of ate the parts that weren t covered and finished off the claw meat i then asked the server what the black green slime was and he said it was roe meaning lobster eggs my lobster was pregnant he told me i was lucky that i got a lobster with roe however it s not what i ordered and was expecting plus it s slimey and not pretty to look at and there was so much it made it so unappetizing the server also said one time they had a live lobster that they picked up that had been oozing roe just before cooking he explained that it was apparently illegal for it to be sold in that condition i m assuming for ecological reasons but then why would you still serve that he also said i got a lot of it i was looking forward to dessert after dinner but because my lobster was not appealing at all i lost my appetite i m a huge fan of cavier but because lobster roe is slimey and black and there were huge gobs of it it was not something i found to be a delicacy and i did not feel lucky at all i didn t have the heart to tell them i didn t like it because i ate the claw meat and as much of the tail as i could muster despite some chewiness my husband looked up online regarding the situation and found different reviews regarding lobster roe being a delicacy and other reviews explained that usually the lobster should not be served if roe is found inside i felt really disappointed with our 500 meal won t be going back if you get lobster with roe make sure you put all your money on black then you re lucky i guess
  i have been going to los olivos for more years than i care to remember they still have the best mexican food in town and you can t beat the salsa
  they know how to treat you here everything is top notch excellent martinis steaks and sides generous enough to share with several people for our special occasion they threw in free desserts
  this place was well worth it i ve been meaning to eat here for a while now since it opened and my fiance and i finally made reservations the weird part is they only have reservations for 5 and 9pm the food is amazing i ordered the signature beef wellington and it was delicious i will definitely be making a trip out here again we also got to take a picture with the executive chef christina i had a great time and enjoyed everything
  our go to style restaurant with my boyfriend is any thai food restaurant we re suckers for a good thai tea _ anyways there was a good thai tea huge typical menu and moderately slow service like most are server was a kind smiley woman that checked in often they deserve five stars simple because it was a quite hole in the wall place we expected delicious
  this place is amazing i ve been told to come here by multiple people including friends from back home in oregon i love that not every burger is the same and they make it for you the way you want it the fries they have there are also very good and this place is defiantly worth stopping by
  skip the delivery go for pickup this has to be one of the most creative lobbies of a pizza place i ve come across 4 tvs with one always on nick jr my 3 year old appreciates that not to mention a basketball hoop hula hoops and other fun things to keep you occupied that is to say you won t be waiting forever for your pizza typically just a few minutes but a fun atmosphere to be in the food oh yeah it s solid great specialty pizzas including the buffalo chicken pizza and the taco pizza not too many places make a taco pizza around here this place does and it s great it s a great choice for the family while it may not be the cheapest place in town it s a great choice
  can i just say never would i have imagined i would fall in love with a mushroom burger and i m not talking about a portabello slapped between 2 pieces of bread if you ve seen ground turkey or veggie patty that s how this burger was made and whatever was used to keep it altogether was awesome my friend had the pasta dish but it was a bit dry perhaps eating at 330am would be one of the reasons for dry pasa i don t know but i would stick with the burgers at those times i even had breakfast and was happy to see that their food was consistently good overall and went back to have another burger the next day at a casino cafe don t expect great service nor fast however the staff at this location was efficient quick and tried to get to all customers as quick as possible this location has a better setup than the palazzo so if you were like me and stayed at the palazzo perhaps stay at the venetian shorter walk and open 24 7 i ate at the palazzo location and the mushroom burger is the same at both but as for the rest of the food you ll have to be the judge i plan to try the la location of this establishment hopefully the food is up to par like in vegas
  solid food and service they took care of us even though the kitchen was about to close the shredded pan fried chicken and moros was great and is recommended
  ya no i have been here so many times i cant count when i visit bww i get the same product every time if the place is packed sure the wait is a little long but the cold beer makes up for it i have always had the game i wanted turned on and theres a shelf for beer at the golden tee machine 3 words wings sports beer dont be a baby
  every year i go to miami for winter music conference i have been lured to go eat at sushi samba over on lincoln but i have never had the chance to eat there not sure why maybe it always seemed to packed and i didn t want to wait i know now that i missed out on some damn good meals right before thanksgiving my wife and my father in law traveled over to las vegas for a few nights as we walked into the venetian hotel i saw a billboard for sushi samba at the adjoining hotel the palazzo and i knew then where we were going for dinner we went up to our room freshened up and headed out we were quickly seated it was a sunday night and the place was half full and placed some drink orders my wife had one of the specialty drinks which was quite good and i had some nigiri sake we started off with the otsumami appetizer which came with edamame shishito peppers and green bean tempura with black truffle aioli all 3 were excellent but we found ourselves fighting over the green beans and that yummy aioli next up was a mixture of ceviches and tiraditos we tried 4 all together with both salmon and yellowtail amazing flavor the yellowtail ceviche taquitos were also amazing i could eat those all day we also had a couple of things from the robata grill the stand out was the miso glazed sea bass it was incredible so tasty it was the best sea bass i have ever had period the peruvian corn that came with it also was quite tasty the waitress recommended the mushroom toban yaki with some grilled duck from the robata grill it was so intense and earthy i definitely got use of those umami tastebuds with this dish loved every bit after all that we saved room for 2 speciality sushi rolls the samba strip roll and the neo tokyo roll both were amazing and filled with different flavors all in all one of the best meais i have had in a while and i have had some amazing meals recently if in vegas you owe yourself do it
  ok
  i must say i did not fully experience this restaurant so i am only reviewing by the quality of their clam chowder and the little bit of service i received while i was in the establishment the chowder was so so it is the best i have found in the immediate area so it might be worth going to if you re nearby and have a craving however for the portion you get it in pretty expensive i have had better chowder at a lower price the service was old school no non sense i kind of liked it the atmosphere is pretty dumpy and kind of creepy i wouldn t recommend women walk across the parking lot alone in fact i might pack heat if i ever visit again some of the biker dudes next door were looking at me like they liked me
  holy crap the red velvet pancakes is some serious business it is amazing what s a better word for amazing orgasmic hahahaha i ordered the short comes with 3 pancakes we also ordered the kalua pig benedict which was also amazing never had a benedict like that before and it was evenly portioned out between the shredded pork and cabbage yanno how some places give you more cabbage than meat yuck but not babycakes the pancakes come with an amazing cream cheese syrup which completes the entree i was in heaven we split both entrees so it was a perfect amount got a little bit of dessert and regular food this is a must go to spot if you have a car the drive is worth it we didn t even have to wait because we went at the buttcrack of dawn but as time went on the place got really packed fast plus the restaurant is pretty small so i can see there being a wait also keep in mind they close at 3pm awww yah
  daaaaannnggg this place is great the bf and i wandered in friday night after attending mmoca nights courtesy of yelp thanks yelp we were strolling around the square feeling a little uninspired over the usual places hamilton s caught my attention out of the corner of my eye the exposed stone and cool lanterns over the bar made me think this is a place i want to sit inside of we walked over and saw a few open tables and assumed there would be a wait those open tables must be for reservations we figured nope we were seated right away and were able to score a table at the window the one seat had a gorgeous view of the capitol i was surprised to see the poor reviews regarding service both the host and our server were extremely friendly and prompt our server was one of the best and most friendly i ve had in awhile we ordered drinks rather quickly very nice list of cocktails with a few unusual selections and our server came back a few minutes later to let us know there would be a small wait because a bunch of people had just sat down at the bar no problem and thanks for letting us know the drinks were great i had the rum sour which was delightfully refreshing one of those drinks that tastes like vacation in a glass the bf had the manhattan which was quite strong but enjoyable for dinner i had the ricotta gnudi and wow just wow the gnudi were outstanding and the broth was perfect not an overwhelming squash flavor at all the broth was so delicious i would have licked the bowl clean if this was socially acceptable alas it is not luckily this dish is served with a spoon so i was able to scrape up as much as possible i m new to madison but those who aren t would know hamilton s is in the previous space which was the blue marlin in a nod to the past occupant the special saturday night was a shrimp diablo my dining companion had that and wow it was also excellent five decent sized shrimp along with some crazy delicious sausage crumbles in a cream sriracha sauce with penne yum yum yum it was exceptional we were both pleasantly surprised at how amazing our food was we will be back for sure the space is really more of a 4 star space and the food really outshines the ambiance i loved the exposed stone walls and lanterns it reminded me a little of chicago s violet hour but the other wall is a little odd and the music doesn t seem to quite go with the feel of the place it wasn t loud at all as other reviewers have written
  this place is good definitely affordable fine dining and i would recommend friends to stop by is it amazing and must try yes and no i m sure there are other vegas establishments more on the wow factor but pricewise for food and the experience yes please do visit i came here with a friend and were able to request and get a seat by the window that looks over to the bellagio water fountains pretty cool i must say the bread oh my they serve awesome bread here there was a piece of sourdough bread on top of the basket covering two pieces of warm wheat type bread two rosemary focaccia and our favorite cheese and salami wrapped bread this last one was soooooo yummy the awesome bread basket came with salted butter a tomato tapenade and olive oil oh my we finished most of the bread basket except the rosemary focaccia and had to ask for a second round of bread to accompany our meal yes that good the salami cheese bread was probably my most favorite thing for dinner lol i ordered the lobster pici which was good there were large pieces of lobster meat in it there better be if it costed 38 the pici was cooked perfectly nothing worng with this dish but tasted like something i could have made at home my friend ordered the ricotta and mushroom agnolotti this was really good i had a few pieces and the wrapper on the agnolotti was super soft it should be since they make their own spaghetti everyday my first choice for entree though was the duck and foie gras ravioli un lucky for me my other friend went to dinner before me and had some leftovers which i was able to try these little suckers were really good heated up so i can only imagine what they would have tasted like if i ordered at dinner and the plate set in front of me drools so i would recommend this dish definitely all in all a really good dinner the staff was all super professional accommodating and attentive good job staff
  about the only decent italian place in south charlotte and well worth the effort great service when we last dined in the bar at a high top and the wine is not too badly priced try the pasta fajiole and the lasgna
  none of their staff seems very excited to be there ever i have been here at all different times and it is always the same humdrum this last time i went with a friend of mine for a late dinner there was still 40 minutes till close so it was not like we skipped in at the last second you could tell the bartender was not too happy about us showing up he offered us drinks and i had to request a menu then he stood there staring at us while we decided what to order we ended up ordering 3 different kinds of tacos he failed to ask us if we wanted flour or corn tortillas and they came out with flour tortillas i am not a fan of flour tortillas it was just not a pleasant dining experience aside from my company i can say they have a great taco tuesday happy hour but otherwise i would never come here for anything else
  we were craving for some good indian food this was perfect destination the buttermilk was super awesome with mint in it totally recommend this place to anybody who loves spicy food
  great patio good happy hour love the carnitas tacos good drink selection interesting options had some jalenpeno margarita of some sorts nice upscale place with a very friendly comfortable atmosphere located in scottsdale quarter just east of brio if you turn in the parking garage off greenway parkway it is just to the left of the parking garage entrance
  this is now my favorite vietnamese restaurant in town i have gone here a few times after trying it for the first time earlier this month not only is the food delicious but the waitress was very nice she would make suggestions on how to dress up the food with the different sauces on the table she doesn t do tell you in a pushy way she is just being nice and helpful i highly recommend 29
  i ve been coming to habanero s since they opened they are the best and most authentic mexican spot in the scottsdale airpark the food is always delicious they have great service and great prices they have two locations in scottsdale now the other one is on scottsdale and shea
  as a las vegas local this is a must go to place when i have visitors in town pork belly steamed buns are soooo delicious
  let s just start by saying i m in such a wow from food to service to the environment my husband and i were here in las vegas for 2 months continuing to build our vacation home on new years eve we sat at the bar first time there friend recommended and this beautiful young woman approached us i believe her name was janna she was very attentive answered all of our questions and even suggested a red wine that would compliment what we were having for dinner we returned last night 1 9 and i was so happy to see her again she remembered what we had from appetizers down to the wine she is such a great spirit we hope to see her more and more when we visit from l a if you haven t tried echo rig yet you are strange
  premier hookah lounge friendly staff best shisha in pittsburgh nawa will see to your every need
  definitely recommend this place i study in mariano and close to this restaurant the manager was so patient i ordered butternut squash soup with coconut milk it was fabulous the crab cake was fantastic since i was alone and with small appetite i couldn t order a main anymore for dessert there were chocolate pot mousse and pudding cake with hot caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream heard pudding cake would come in big portion so i chose chocolate mousse the mousse was average definitely going to come back and try the jampon and the dessert
  good coffee breakfast sandwiches and tea selection much needed in north scottsdale
  ah fuel fuddle fuel fuddle was one of my college dining favorites but since i m no longer a student i wondered when i stopped in today if the place would be as good as i remembered it was woo a friend and i came by for dinner after a day at the museums and as previous pitt students the noise and collection of young diners didn t surprise us we just got our seat and raised our voices so we could hear each other as we talked while looking at the menu i was surprised by how many beers and ciders and whatnot they offered the last time i ate here i was under 21 so i didn t remember this at all i saw that the portobello sandwich i d eaten here previously was still on the menu ah good times but figured it would be nice to try a few other things so my friend and i each ordered a burger his made with regular beef mine a black bean patty and decided to split their rollafatty the rollafatty appetizer is basically two mini pepperoni rolls served with a side of sauce very greasy very cheesy and very yummy i m glad i split it though then our main courses came out on that were plates 100 covered by our food i think the burgers were pretty standard restaurant sized burgers and the other half of our plates were full with a mix of regular and sweet potato fries the fries while a bit salty were absolutely delicious so was my black bean burger the garden of eat n i love black bean sandwiches and appetizers in general and this one was covered in pesto sauce and mixed with other burger toppings very yummy i loved what i ate but ultimately left with about a third of my sandwich and most of my fries plus my friend s he didn t want them as neither of us could finish our entire meals i doubt we could have even if we skipped the rollafatty appetizer graduate or not i m definitely still a fan of fuel fuddle it s not fine dining but it s good pub restaurant burgers sandwiches pizzas salads etc and they have a great selection of drinks and the service is generally really quick given the crowds they bring in of course if you stop in while school s in session you will have to share your eating space with students so as long as you re ok with that i recommend stopping in to eat here sometime the sweet potato fries alone are worth it
  this place is actually pretty awesome but i feel like we managed to come at a perfect moment just before the mad rush that forced people to wait for an hour while i luxuriated like caesar on a comfy couch stuffing my face with delight waiting anywhere sucks and brgr doesn t have quite enough room to fit the herd of people that were forced to wait in the cramped entry way i imagine if i had to wait an hour for a burger i d be inclined to bitch about the font choice on the sign as well but as i said we had to wait for about three minutes for our glorious table as the sign would suggest this place is primarily a burger joint though it does have an excellent bar i d recommend the button buster for your burger and a scotty karate beer to accompany the addition of flat screens doesn t really seem to fit in with the rest of decor for the most part it seems to be striving for a high end jacket required type of restaurant and on the other hand you can watch women s basketball service was very good for how busy it ended up getting with a special shout out to the animated male host who was our initial welcome into the joint recommended for a group of four or more don t take a first date there we watched several awkward couples trying to politely wrap their mouths around gargantuan burgers oh and try an alcoholic milkshake because we re all going to die from something and it might as well be from a novelty drink
  do not order from this place it took an hr and a half to get the food from delivery ordered chilly cheese fires had no cheese and they were so sogy and gross looking looked like something my dog would throw up the burger was so under cooked to where you could get sick eating it oh and the bun was the cheap 99 cent buns you get from the store the cheesesteak was also cheap bun no meat at all they just fill it with a lot of cheese and other crap horrible i wouldn t give this to my worst enemies people in jail get better meals
  went here with a group of girlfriends the food is delicious and the scenery obviously awesome the menu is a la carte we each ordered our own entree and sides i wish our server would have told us that the sides were large enough to feed a whole family we would have saved a lot of money and spared all the wasted food but all that food was delicious perfectly cooked tender steak creamy mashed potatoes and flavorful asparagus i would definitely return for a romantic dinner and we would share
  pretty nice little hole in the wall mexican joint conveniently situated next to home depot its out of the way and real easy to miss but if you come to hd for a ladder or paint or whatever and happen to be hungry then this little place is for you do not expect anything fancy or special but i do not think you will be disappointed give it s shot it will not cost you much either i like
  i honestly can t talk this place up enough the first time i had the dogs i ll admit i was a little tipsy who isn t when you re hanging around downtown that late at night i may not have even tasted the hot dog the first time i had one because i ate it so quickly i was quick to declare this the best hot dog in town because honestly everything tastes amazing when you re drunk right it took a sober encounter with these dirty water dogs just a nickname don t let it throw you before i could really genuinely appreciate how good they are my advice is to get them with everything on em you ll really get the entire range of flavors and textures that way these days i really can t leave the stand with only one at 3 they are definitely a steal there s only one downer i can think of while cheffini does accept credit debit cards using the square app on his phone it ll cost you an extra dollar to pay that way i get that it s a convenience and i m always willing to pay an extra dollar to a small business but it s an unpleasant surprise if you re not ready for it
  if we could give this location no stars we would i m writing this on behalf of my boyfriend who recently patronized this location and wound up with food poisoning he ordered a corned beef sandwich and the following morning was violently ill eat at your own risk
  it s subway what do you want
  great food wonderful service as soon as you walk in you know this place is going to be good the atmosphere is great native chinese own and operate this business we love the orange chicken and the steamed vegetables we love this place great for the price for sure
  wow very impressed i just moved to a new apartment recently and took a chance on this place for delivery i used the online order option and was quoted 45 60 minutes for delivery my order arrived in less than 30 minutes hot and delicious i order sweet and sour shrimp crab puffs and shrimp fried rice the order before the tip was 20 and well worth it since it was easily enough for 2 people the shrimp was packaged separate from the sauce so it wasn t soggy and the crab puffs are the best will definitely stay with this option
  i was really impressed with this place initially i thought the idea of an oatmeal cafe seemed a little silly because really is it that hard to mix hot water and oats but it s so much more than that the owner gave me an overview of their offerings and i went for muesli option since i m a euro wannabe she suggested the campfire s mores mix and i was so delighted to hear that they use gelatin free marshmallows it s one of the hardest things to turn down as a vegetarian i loved the oatmeal so much that i went out to the farmer s market a few days later to buy more mixes for home the cafe also has lots of great tea selections i got the vanilla mate and brewed a second mug at work per the owner s suggestion there s also muffins smoothies and pancakes but what i m looking forward to the most on my next visit is the veggie burgers
  the worst imaginable food disgusting a joke
  i regret to say that our dinner experience was quite terrible here our food was bad the spinach pie was off and the soup was rancid the service was slow we were left at our table waiting for 30 minutes waiting for a check after we declined dessert not many vegetarian options
  just tried this place had two rolls and a dinner special box the rolls are sooooo good i tried kiss of fire and the no rice roll that s four different fish in soy paper i forgot the name also the 2 piece sushi orders the quality of fish is so great also tried hot sake and the cold lemon sake i never really like cold sake but this one was really good also can t go wrong with mochi for dessert shared green tea mango strawberry and red bean with my friends
  awesome local find on a sunday in madison wi and the packers are playing adding to the vibe
  only in vegas can you eat at a restaurant where the ceilings and walls changes every 20 minutes it was quite the experience music comes on and the whole restaurant dims as if a magic show was about to start the decor changing wasn t anything spectacular but it was entertaining for sure this restaurant is definitely pricey but that s what you can expect for dining at encore we started off with the grilled octopus which came with potatoes olives tomatoes cured lemon oil i was worried the octopus was going to be chewy but it wasn t at all the potatoes lemon oil and tomatoes were a perfect compliment to this dish giving it a light and delicate taste i also ordered the hudson valley foie gras that came with chesnut cranberry cake and cranberry syrup it was easily the best tasting foie gras dish i have ever had and would highly recommend it if you are a fan of foie gras the chestnut cranberry cake with cranberry syrup brightened up the foie gras the flavors came together effortlessly and were truly divine for steaks we ordered the dry aged new york strip and bone in rib eye the new york strip had a deep beefy flavor it was delicious the rib eye was juicy and made to perfection the steaks come with a roasted clove of garlic which had great flavor and complimented the steak very well for sides we shared the yukon gold potato gratin dauphinois and the black truffle creamed spinach my favorite was the creamed spinach you can definitely taste the black truffle in the spinach and it gave the dish an infusion of flavors
  a part of me cringed when a friend suggested the grand cafe as a dinner option it is not so much the food that induces this reaction but more about the memories it brings back i spent a few years working at gvr and drifted between many of the food outlets by far the cafe was the toughest to handle let s just say the movie waiting felt like our lives minus the unhygienic shenanigans now that i am on the other side i can definitely appreciate it a little more the service was pleasant and prompt my friend and i had ordered the prime rib dinner i got mine with a baked potato and he got his with mashed we were both pleased with our meals it was not out of this world but it was good it is the same prime rib that is served at the buffet if you want to stuff yourself then it would be best to go next door the remodel does bring a more sophisticated atmosphere to the coffee shop the layout is still the same as the old one but updated with nicer furniture and fixtures i would dine here again if i was in the gvr
  beautiful setting on a farm and the property itself is very nice service was pleasant but a bit slow the food was good but very pricey and the wine list was arizona centric with very few from other wine regions of the world i ve noticed that in the few upscale arizona restaurants i have been to they really emphasize local wines while being from ny i hardly see ny wines on ny nyc restaurant wine lists hmmmm interesting anyway my beef tartare was very good though it was served with pickled veggies and two small cubes of blue cheese which i felt were unnecessary and didn t belong yet i hardly got any toast to put my tartare on only two small pieces my enree of bone in pork belly was interesting and tasty but way too fatty even for pork belly again very pricey here entrees average upper 30 s low 40 s and i feel it is worth it as a one time thing for a special occasion but not a standout experience
  there are so many different places in scottsdale that are better the food is mediocre and the staff are total jerks the bartender we dealt with gave us bad service and on top of that other members of the staff were very rude someone should remind them that customers drive their business so they shouldn t alienate them we will not be back and you shouldn t go either
  overall my party was very happy with rita s we started off with the chips and guac which were fantastic very crisp but not stale chips and guac that wasn t too salty or spicy although they can make it as salty or as spicy as you like my boyfriend ordered a caesar and i honestly think it s the best caesar i ve ever had because the dressing was really creamy i had the shrimp enchiladas and a side of their corn which they were nice enough to take off of the cob for me i love mexican corn and this was some of the best the enchiladas were great too my boyfriend had the seabass and it was well cooked and had a pretty good flavor although maybe not as rich as i prefer seabass to be i can t remember what our friends had but i know they were happy as well the service was just as good as the food i would definitely recommend it
  meh i ve experienced better sums up my experience with the place i ve been here a few times and have tried a couple of different items and have pretty much had the same experience each time the goods friendly service decent wings good crust sauce on the pizza the not so goods it s kind of hard for me to pin point what exactly is wrong with this place the servers are friendly but they don t seem to know what can and can t be done example i ask for a small cup of water and here is what i was replied with the times i asked 1 grab a bottle of water and it should be fine 2 sure here s a cup and you can use the fountain 3 ok i will give you a cup but be sure not to fill it up with soda and they they charged me for fountain soda anyway i didn t realize until after i paid to continue with the lack of consistency even though we eat in every single time we are often brought out food already boxed up as if we ordered pick up or delivery one time once we ordered a pizza the server walked out with the pizza in the box without any plates or utensils you might ask why utensils read later at least attempt to cater towards your dine in visitors lets talk about the pizza i am a major pizza enthusiast and i don t believe there is a such thing as a bad pizza but i ve never been more disappointed with a pie in such a long time i tried the supreme pizza and outside of the crust and sauce everything was such a complete hope mess it just seemed like they threw on numerous frozen vegetables and then caked a lot of cheese on the top of the toppings and assumed that was it the peppers and onions weren t fully cooked and the toppings were so heavy i could barely even hold a slice without all of the cheese and toppings falling off this is why having utensils would be nice so i can at least some pieces and eat the pizza with the cheese and toppings in one bite this pizza would be somewhat passable if they only delivered but if i m dining in i would expect some kind of quality increase since the pizza would generally be fresher i severely question the reviews that say this is the best pizza in town i understand that this is a local establishment but that doesn t mean it should get favorable reviews for unfavorable flavors is this better than digorno nope is this better than little caesars sorry but not really i like lc though but why would i come to a place that has lower quality pizza for double the price of lc 8 for a supreme despite the fact that some of their other food is decent mainly the wings i place a heavy weight on the pizza itself i really wanted this to be a great place but soniamdissapoint it just seems like they are on the cusp of making a damn good pizza hopefully they take actual criticism and will make proper adjustments if anyone is wondering why am i so critical of the pizza it s because it s a pizzeria idonotproofreadsomyreviewsmightsoundlikegibberish
  horrible service they don t let us sit until all parties arrived our kids are starving and crying and the host manager katrina just ignored us and walked away without any help at all to get the problems resolved we are the hotel guests and being treated like this i asked for her manager contact info and she refuses to give it to us worst experience at all i hope the ceo or the pr of resort see this review and improve their customer service at the buffet immediately
  this place is great the food was interesting and prepared well the wine shop attached to the restaurant was what really set this place apart being able to select your wine from the fantastic selection based upon your menu choices was fun and only added to the wonderful evening believe me when i say i will be back this place is a true hidden gem in vegas
  this place is my most favorite chinese restaurant i can drink the warm tea by the gallon and the service is always spot on along with the food i go here every time i am in phoenix or near it s not exactly in a real great area but it s worth the trip i had pad thai with shrimp last time and we started with pork dumplings the portions are good for a couple meals and this review makes me want to eat there now
  this is good standard fare for a brewhouse there is a good beer list and a wide range of menu items we have been here many times and always have a good meal great for families as well and there are lots of tv s around to catch any game going on we will definitely be back again
  excellent food very surprising from looking at the small pub but the atmosphere and food are both awesome
  4 5 goodness gracious is there always a line here we waited 2 hours on a monday evening off peak and non holiday weekend ate dinner at 10 pm you have been forewarned limited seating 16 seats and only 12 people in line when we first got there this being my first time here i just followed suit we all got the combo pan roasts in varying degrees of spiciness which is one of their most popular dishes i wanted to try the gumbo but my friend said it wasn t as good as the pan roast oh well next time verdict excellent 1 shared between two girls was perfect we were full and satisfied and we re big eaters too the guys who each had their own pan roast were in pain for an hour afterwards because they didn t share yet had to eat every last drop because we re asian mwahahaha oysters on the half shell were large and juicy but not as creamy as i like the best oysters are still found in the nw sigh i didn t care much for the bread but it made for good dipping tip ask for the rice on the side if you don t plan to eat it all otherwise they automatically add it to the roast and because of all the cream sauce it s hard to differentiate if the leftovers are unnecessary carbs from rice or a tasty piece of seafood you accidentally left behind
  the pizza here is pretty tasty and the slices are huge my stepdaughter got three meals out of a single slice i think they put entirely too much cheese on their pizza i like to be able to taste the sauce and not have to search for it under an inch of gooey cheese i recognize that i m probably in the minority in that sense the sandwich i had was so so it s called the italian w peppers or something along those lines but there were no peppers on mine i like that they serve boar s head meats because as far as lunchmeat goes theirs has the least amount of junk in it their fries were awful they tasted like reheated fast food fries i paid an extra 1 25 to upgrade but i won t do it again all in all though i m glad this place is in my neighborhood it s clean cheap quick and the pizza is far better than any of the chain places in the area
  just ok the winner on the brunch buffet was the cocktail shrimp the loser of the whole experience was the waitress no personality and terrible service coffee was ok my husband likes it but i ve had better most of the hot items were cold on the buffet the food could have been warmer or fresh off the griddle oven and you have to toast your own croissants bagels breads they had crab legs on the menu but they were cold and hard to eat when you sit a few inches away from your neighbor it s a one and done kind of place tried it but did not love enough to come back
  go there at 6pm or before to the the pre theatre prix fixe menu for about half the price of the normal prix fixe
  i did not expect to find such an amazing array of steaks at a place called the ocean club i opted for the none in 12 oz filet mignon and i was absolutely in heaven after the first bite just an incredible dining experience from beginning to end and the staff was very attentive to every detail we will be back and next time we will make reservations
  new izakaya in vegas i really like this place black white and lavender color decor looks very nice all servers are friendly and nice too i like their cute picture menu reminds me of local izakaya that i used to go to back in japan i really like their hamachi carpaccio they use super yummy belly part with unique toppings with seaweed salad amazing i also love black cod misoyaki very traditional izakaya menu that i ve always wished i could have here in vegas well now i can they have variety of skewers and they are ok just ok though it s not the best skewers you can get in town too bad but i like most of the other stuff they have chicken nanban is also my favorite i usually ask them to cook chicken well done i ve had it little pinkish once so i just want to make sure it s well cooked when i order them over all it s my new favorite japanese restaurant i was so happy to have warabi mochi i love japanese old school sweets
  great beer here and a better atmosphere to boot i ventured out to this place and was quite impressed with the beer offerings that they had i had the black star stout the hardway ipa and the all nighter and all of them were stellar for dinner i had the cajun pasta which i would highly recommend to anyone the guy sitting next to me at the bar who appeared to be a regular told me the deep dish pizzas here were stellar but since i was a party of one i thought that a whole deep dish would be too much my waistline the rest of the menu appeared to be standard brewery fare with a solid selection of pastas pizza sandwiches burgers and appetizers the atmosphere of this place was kinda nice downstairs had a enclosed smoking area bar where i learned the bartenders can take your food order but not deliver it to your table due to smoking laws they leave you food right outside the section tell you it s ready and you have to get it yourself complete with many tvs and there was an upstairs section as well that had a golden tee machine and a cigar lounge there also was a normal dining area and a patio as well service in the smoking area of the bar was a bit slow as the bartenders seemed a bit preoccupied by the girls at the end of the bar rather than my empty beer glass but i can t really blame them too much since the girls were hot great food great beer great atmosphere hit his place up if you are ever in the area
  i love gecko grill my family and i don t go out to eat much but when we do gecko grill is one of the top choices i ve tried lots of things on the menu over the years and am convinced that anything i order would be good i recommend the chicken mango quesadilla
  because i would be arriving during mother s day weekend at u of i i emailed ahead and asked if i could make a reservation since i knew it would be packed i received an answer promptly and was accommodated service was great and friendly our party enjoyed chicken parm fish tacos and the chicken wraps all were very tasty my contact via email sam came over to our table and checked how things were going we all enjoyed our experience and will be back thanks to sam and pete for going out of their way to make our dining experience a pleasant one
  after walking out of tc s ribs today this is the place we decided to go to instead it s in the same strip mall and looked pretty promising we walked in and it looked reminiscient of roberto s though much cleaner on the inside dad ordered two carne asade burritos and i decided to try the machaca we both thought it was strange that this place doesn t have rice but we still decided to give it a chance the chips and salsa came first and they were the best part of the entire meal they tasted homemade and the pico de gallo was amazing i can t say the same for the other salsas they provided which were just alright both of our burritos were extremely bland they didn t taste bad but they definently had very little flavor it was also a bummer that they put beans in the machaca burrito the guy at the counter had even asked me if i had wanted them and i said no i probably won t be coming back again but i will say that the employees were really friendly and the food was cheap
  an awesome place to become a regular at the food is wonderful as is the very friendly staff as they help you venture down new roads in thai cuisine i just enjoyed the wonton soup although similar to the chinese version this was full of taste roast pork veggies and homemade wontons the shrimp rolls are outstanding and should not be missed i was lucky and found the best crying tiger that i have ever eaten it has changed the way that i eat beef the sauce is remarkable i think the best thing that i can share with those that have not experienced the thai cafe yet is that each dish is full of taste and some heat depending upon your wishes but the heat never overpowers the dish all that i can say is try it out for yourself i hope that i haven t lost my seat there once the word is out this is one restaurant that will be crowded for sure
  for a breakfast place mickies is fantastic this place has great scrambles and omelettes the potatoes here were well cooked and well seasoned a bit greasy but for breakfast cooking eggs in bacon fat is fantastic unfortunately it s rather packed in here during the morning and can be a bit cramped and uncomfortable the service was quick and friendly all in all pretty solid food for a great price would highly recommend
  the reason i am giving 4 stars is not because this is the best sushi in the valley this was my first conveyor belt sushi experience i was happy to see that most of the rolls had a cover over them this was a concern of mine so the four stars there were several really great rolls and the fresh tuna was awesome some of the selections were just ok but still worth eating there were 3 of us that night and we all got stuffed to the max for 27 dollars total the price is right the food good and we all had a great time choosing the rolls and trying different selections definitely would visit again
  i can t believe i finallymade it here every time we go to vegas i want to eat here and we ususally get sooooo f cked up we never make it it has to be one of the top 10 restaurants i ve ever been to the service was perfect the food was perfect and the the bathrooms were works of art i beleive we got at least one of everything on the menu that wasn t seafood i don t do seafood we must have gotten at least 3 4orders of foie fras never had it grilled beforeand it was awesome i guess they import thier charcoal from japan and use pieces of it for chop stick rests too they also import 3 4 soy sauces from japan and blend them we were drinking the stuff man did we all swell the next day but it was worth it from now on we re going here everytime i m in vegas
  if i was born on a farm and was retarded bruges might impress me but i wasn t and i m not so it doesn t colin farrell in bruges i must respectfully disagree mr farrell park bruges thoroughly impressed me with their variety of classical belgian dishes friendly and competent staff cozy location and impressive beer list my ever present girlfriend and i met a few friends at park bruges one tuesday evening for some dinner it was a beautiful night so we opted to sit outside it was also the only remaining four top in the restaurant since we were the second to arrive our friends already had a table outside therefore i will refrain from reviiwing the atmosphere inside the actual restaurant for the time being i am going back so look for it in either another review or an edit of this one what i did see through the large picture window looked like a cozy little place with a nice bar and seating for maybe 40 to lead off any good meal i think you need a good beer park bruges certainly comes through in that department while their draft selection is a little limited they more than make up for it by having a very very nice selection of bottles both belgian and craft import this is a big plus for my friend jon a belgian beer nut who likes park bruges even more than i do while i respect the belgian ales and do partake on occassion i like a greater variety than the yeasty sweetness you get in those particular styles and the melange of other options pleased me greatly the service was very good also our server was nice attentive and informative a great combination for a waitress she always made sure our glasses were never empty our old plates were always quickly whisked away almost as soon as we were done and we always had plenty of fresh bread this is very important as you will see in a minute on to the main event the food i went there expecting to get a nice meal maybe an appetizer dessert and main that all went out the window when i saw the menu and wanted everything on it that s usually a good sign so i went with my gut literally i was starving and loaded up on slald soup fries a burger mussels and dessert yes i am a fatass but at least i am a happy fatass for the salad i got the regular house salad tossed in a champagne vinegarette overall i remember it being a good salad but the other items i had kind of overshadowed it so sorry i can t be a little more detailed as my salad was coming out my friends were getting their onion soups one look and a whif later i am chasing down the waitress to get one for myself one of the better ideas i have had in some time if i may say it came out piping hot like a good onion soup should and somthered in creamy melty emmental cheese the apples they put in it kind of threw me through a loop but it was a good loop to be sure the next item i got was the pei mussels in a classic garlic onion white wine and cream sauce they mussels were cooked well so they were firm but not rubbery the sauce they were in was the true star of the dish i was a little thinner than what i would have made myself but it tasted fantastic this is where all that extra bread came in handy they didn t even need to rinse the plate after i got through with it for dinner i got the bruges burger with coleslaw and an order of the pomme frites the burger was cooked medium rare like i like it and the shredded short ribs mixed with the creamy gruyere was a delightful little pop to the sandwich it was a good burger not the best i have had but i wouldn t hesitate to order it again the fries were also done properly as well they were double fried and seasoned well take note pittsburgh crispy salty fries are invading and i am telling them where to find resistance fighters and the garlic mayo added the perfect bit of zazz to go with them for dessert we had a stout infused belgian waffle with a homemade chocolate candied walnut ice cream it was good and a manager told me it was an experiment but i felt it fell a little flat the stout just made the waffle taste burned but the ice cream the truly good part covered up the flavor well i would liked to have seen perhaps a fruit sorbet with the stout waffle or maybe a lindeman s framboise or kriek infused waffle with the same ice cream all said and done i really enjoyed my visit to park bruges i wish that i could have rated them higher but it was just a few flaws that kept them out of the top slot i gave them the yay i m a fan rating because the one or two little misteps kept them out of the realm of woohoo as good as it gets park bruges may not be as good as it gets but they are pretty damn close i look forward to my next visit
  really oily food lacking the great seasonings to make up for it the calamari didn t have the light breading as advertised and was over fried that s all i remember
  what a cool place the beercave was very unique if i hadn t just had my wisdom teeth out i would have totally sampled some of the fine brews they had stocked away what i did enjoy was the friend zucchini it was hot from the fryer when it got to our table and it absolutely hit the spot i d never had it before and zucchini is one of my favorite vegetables my friend said that the service can be slow but we didn t have any problems
  stopped in here for a slice after shopping really good pizza and the staff was extra friendly fast and delicious highly recommend
  kind of annoyed with them i ordered an oreo mcflurry with hot fudge paid for my ice cream but no hot fudge on it asked for and was told they were out
  the most authentic thai food ever you must try this place out the barbecue chicken at this place was absolutely phenomenal i highly recommend it and get the sweet thai chili sauce it s absolutely amazing
  what how did i not write a review for this yet that s wild this is a cash only pretzel extravaganza every type of warm soft pretzel you can think of from tomato parmesan to chicken salad family owned makes auntie anne s look like mcdonalds in comparison this is a place that embodies the term just take my money look for groupon deals and get a whole bunch for an event or party
  we tried their curry chicken fried rice and the pad woon sen i am not into hot spicy foods so of course i ordered these two dishes mild and with less oil i was impressed that the kitchen actually got it right and both items were cooked with less oil and spice i must say that i liked it a lot the silver noodles were very tasty the fried rice was also good but next time i think i will tell them not to put in the green leaves basil leaf that was stir fried with the rice overall i quite like their food the service was a little slow but that was because there was a big take out order and there was only one waitress handling the whole front end two thumbs up though i will definitely be going back to try some of their other dishes
  wow we really changed things up and ate an early dinner at the bar fred is awesome and attentive to excellent customer service
  well caveat emptor with this place i had the groupon so i made my reservation on a day that it was about 103 degrees in pittsburgh i called and gave my name and phone number this is why i was surprised when i got there to learn that the air condition had broken they didn t even think to call and tell me i decided to perservere and took a seat outside with my friend while the initial waiter was friendly i had to wave down the other waiter that continued to walk by and completely ignore us we ordered the rabbit as an appetizer the waiter set it down and left they forgot to serve it with the crustini so what we had was a plate of a rabbit patte with nothing to scoop onto disaster and not good for dinner my friend and i both ordered the beet salad while it was very tasty the portion size equaled approximately half a cup for 11 it was a rip off the grand finale was when the bill arrived and i was given a leaky pen that exploded all over my dress and hands while the waiter was kind and got me soda water there was no offer for dry cleaning nor to take any money off our bill i would not return here i d also be amazed if it is there in six months given all the terrible reviews too bad it s a great location with a lot of potential
  i loved it but it is no longer there
  solid food love coming to this place
  what actually makes a good chinese takeaway because isn t all chinese takeaway food the same it s always too sweet full of msg and congealed so it doesn t really matter which chinese takeaway you go to you can expect the same thing gili gulu unfortunately isn t much different i mean it s a little better in that the sauces aren t as thick but everything is so sweet i m giving them 3 because it s one of the better chinese takeaways i ve ever had but that isn t saying much i had shredded chilli beef which was ok the beef was soggy not crispy but the sauce was suitably hot and the rice was nice and fluffy delivery was pretty prompt and we did get a free bag of prawn crackers and i do love prawn crackers but i should really stop getting chinese takeaways you re better off making it yourself or going out to a restaurant
  this is the best steak i have ever had in my life and i felt compelled to add a review based off of what some of the other reviewers have wrote here some people have said the food was so bad that they cried from sadness what i feel sorry for anyone who tasted this meal and had tears of sadness forming from it that is ridiculous and absolutely not true there were also some statements that after their horrible meal they went down stairs and ordered pizza instead my god people get off your high horses and just enjoy a well crafted meal the rib cap was amazing highly recommended the beef wellington was also a favorite of mine as welll mix in some mac and cheese with a baked potato and you have a glorious meal to dig in on wine was reasonably priced and i absolutely got my monies worth will be back and again best steak ever
  quality dinner with a side of ric flair wooo
  one of my favorite places in c u the strawberry goat cheese salad is my favorite and don t forget the strawberry pale ale
  well cooked but predictable with some some meh service so this was a reco from a few friends we scored a last minute reservation and we were kind of excited to try so at the end of the day some of the food was really good turnip soup w bacon and some was just kind of good but expected i thought the food would be more exciting but in the end it was well made but not really memorable the lamb shank was fine the fish was a bit dull and smothered in cream sauce soup the service was super over friendly which is fine except they disappeared for almost an hour leaving us staring at an empty table between app and entree not the end of the world but kind of puts a damper on the night nobody came to check on us or give us any explanation we obviously left somewhat unhappy but the waiter chose not to really give a shit was it worth the big bucks the 40 in cab fare for us nope but maybe it was just a bad night either way i had to grab a sandwich afterwards
  we use bertha s at work for lunch catering and they are always on time affordable and delicious i always make sure to order myself an additional sandwich salad combo when they deliver so to start bertha s is fantastic some of my favorite sandwiches roasted turkey pesto chicken roast beef and blue cheese chicken curry their harvest salad and thai chicken salads are also fantastic i m a fan
  kona rubbed steak and a bottle of jordan cab tough to beat place is a little dark otherwise a great steakhouse
  food was fine but it literally took a half an hour with 3 cars in front of us in the drive thru not sure what was wrong
  oh my days loudons why didn t i visit you sooner what a gorgeous vast yet simultaneously cosy cafe space what an amazing array of cakes scones croissants and rocklobster chocs greet my eyes what a wonderfully extensive range of teas coffees and sinfully tempting lunch options and what s this free wifi you had me at hello loudons has only been open for a month or two and after hearing much buzz on the twittosphere about it i had been meaning to go for an age slightly off my beaten path in fountainbridge near tollcross i had to make it an official diary entry for a mutual working morning coffee and laptop meetup and it worked quite the charm as i ve said and you can see from my uploaded photos the space is really quite vast there are a few couches and lots of tables that are perfect for such laptop larks occupying a corner space it also has floor to ceiling windows on two walls it s so bright even on a slightly overcast february morning in auld reekie the tea much to my delight is loose leaf the chocolates are supplied by rock lobster and really worth gazing over for a good few minutes the cakes oh my i had already had my breakfast but by 10am i couldn t resist any more i had a date slice oats and dates that s healthy right as recommended by the barrista i thanked her several times it was delicious i could really taste the honey and was that vanilla crunchy oats gooey dates inbetween lush and perfect with my loose leaf tea i spent a good few hours here in the early morning working chatting eating date slice and generally soaking up the atmosphere in that time several similar work types also came in for breakfast meetings and general paper reading oh yes they have a lot of papers and magazines to browse including wired ftw so if you end up here alone you definitely won t feel lonely after only one visit loudons is a firm favourite i will be back again for an early morning scone and tea and then perhaps a soup or sandwich oh and why not another date slice
  they definitely disclose that it s not typical mexican tacos so if that s what you want go somewhere else they have very innovative delicious ingredients and i ve loved every taco i ve tried the nachos are especially delicious and the tequila selection is great
  this place is great love the chicken tikka masala and the naan love the garlic this place singlehandedly put the word naan in our kids vocabulary they clamor for it each time we are there also the prices are fantastic
  great food my daughter is obsessed great staff always friendly very clean but always cold inside so bring a light jacket a little pricey but it s worth it for the amount of food you get bring an appetite and leave stuffed
  burger is hands down one of the top in lv and i m somewhat of a burger connoisseur style and design were great i love the brick walls art pigs color palette etc light too bright over booths felt very cafeteria ish i would dim those down some tables at the booths were a little small also my back started hurting because i couldn t sit all the way back and eat over the table i was hunched over most of the time service is so so a little more education on the menu items and customer service would do some wonders all in all it s worth the trip to try the burger
  i ve been to pigglys about a handful of times and have tried a few menu items the fried desserts are really good but i feel are a little pricey for fried oreos the corn dog is huge and delicious and big enough to share for a starter i ve tried the brisket and pulled pork platter and was pleased at the amount of the flavor tenderness and variety of bbq you get to choose i ve also had the salad bar each time and it s been fresh and delicious and sometimes i just get that and a few drinks the last time i visited i came with my cousin and her two kids she had suggested charleston s but i thought pigglys was more kid appropriate with the cool decor and being able to doodle up your table because they put down butcher paper we did have a great time coloring and playing tic tac toe i just got the salad bar and they went with the taco tuesday special to be honest i didn t think the tacos looked great but they didn t say they were horrible either so i guess for unlimited tacos they were happy with what they got i love corn bread very much and have had some of the best around but pigglys bread was a little on the dry side or maybe we got a bad batch so i just added some sour cream and salsa to wet it up a bit all in all great atmosphere nice bartenders decent food and fun for the family thanks
  i have been going here since it opened the only decent sushi in the sw valley good service
  i went to fusion sushi china bistro for the first time with a friend of mine who has visited this place many times we ordered take out not knowing that they will deliver when slow i believe their delivery times start at 5pm and go til 9pm don t quote me on that though they have a wide variety of chinese food and sushi the man i spoke to when picking up the order said they have been opening chinese food restaurants since 1984 and this is the first time they have ever combined the types of food he also said they have been open for about 3 months anyways we ordered the spicy tuna roll spider roll las vegas roll and the summer roll all were quite amazing the spicy tuna roll was great all the flavors were fresh and they were perfect bite sizes spicy too of course the spider roll is soft shell crab with the normal ingredients and this was also amazing soft shell crab is my favorite and they did a great job the las vegas roll was truly a treat basically it is a california roll with cream cheese deep fried w eel sauce mmmmm i believe i may have found a new favorite and last but not least the summer roll this thing tastes like summer in your mouth the mango on the outside is so sweet this is the perfect place for a wonderful afternoon lunch a must try enjoy
  just went there to have dinner with friends great atmosphere good foods and wonderful customer service best teppanyaki in las vegas must try
  this location has a charming ambience as it is located in a rather old building went there for lunch and had an okay meal started with the soup it was their oktoberfest cheese soup i swear i ordered a cup but received and was charged for a bowl it was fine though it would ve been nice if it were served with bread for my entree i had the parmesan crusted tilapia served with a side of pasta the pasta was cooked a perfect al dente and the sauce was tasty though applied sparingly the fish had a very nice crisp crust unfortunately it utterly lacked seasoning including salt a cardinal sin of the kitchen service was friendly but absent minded i was offered freshly grated parmesan but the server had to go get it by the time she found her way back to the table some time later i was already halfway through my lunch though i was only dining with one companion she couldn t recall who got what dish warning the parking is valet only they do not charge for the valet but of course you are expected to tip this isn t something most people expect when dining in the suburbs so make sure you have a few ones on you
  one of the best places in phoenix situated in the old historic district cibo has great wines great appetizer s too i recommend one of my favorite pizza s that is prepared just like you would have in italy the pizza con proscuitto crudo
  a
  i m with mark the best pizza in town best that i ve had anyway it s like new york city pie big slices foldable but actually better carmine s has better pizza than my favorite place in queens if you can t trust a fat man s opinion on pizza who can you trust beer selection is pretty good they had a lovely brooklyn amber ale on tap and a few tasty treats maureen the barkeeper is a real beauty and even nicer and more professional than you can imagine i just love this place and hope that they can make a go of it in this location i m rooting for them and will be a regular oh and the video poker machines are pretty loose
  one of the top spots in pittsburgh for breakfast brunch
  ya i used to work here and the management was horrible i as an employee was often working by myself during a lunch rush with a line out the door and nobody to help me we often ran out of products because management never ordered things in time i pretty much held this place together for a year and i told them that when i left that they would close within 3 to 4 months because the location was not good that was in may and they have now since closed
  i am not really burger guy but this place makes the most delicious burgers go early or late open till midnight cause it does get busy and as per every american restaurant they will take your empty plate away asap europeans hate that wait untill everyone is finished cause we wont leave quicker anyway i ordered the ronin burger honey had the kiki burger we also ordered pepper salt garlic fries very good and a fois grass appetizer nice presentation the buns were soft caramelized onions were sweet angus beef was cooked perfectly and the sauce on it was special they have a lot of great soda drinks too felix the waiter knew his menu and was very helpful in helping us to select we ll be back but not too soon cause my calorie intake yesterday was a bit too high
  happy hour everyday 2 5pm half price drinks n slushes
  delish we stopped by sugar factory around brunch time we put down our names and were told there would be a 15 minute wait we took our buzzer and headed a few steps away into the candy shop section of the store about 5 minutes later just enough time to get a chocolate chip cookie and brownie we were buzzed and seated they had a pretty good assortment of items to choose from and have a decent sized cocktail menu which features drinks in fun goblets i ordered the tomato mozzarella pizza and my boyfriend order steak sandwich with fries my pizza was supposedly an individual sizd portion but it was eight slices and i definitely had to get the rest to go it was delicious had a hint of garlic chewy crust a tad too much cheese for my taste but overall tasty my boyfriend devoured his steak sandwich and fries i m not normally a french fry eater but i could help snatch a few for our two meals we paid 36 before tip the only drinks we got were waters our waiter was super friendly and attentive i felt that he was genuinely kind and didnt have the fake snobby attitude as the hostesses in the front did the bistro and the candy shop are both definitely places that i ll return to during my next trip
  mr sandwich is a great quick pho place the pho and sandwiches here are amazing and everything is cheap they have a loyalty card for drinks and entrees you can earn a free meal at 7 which is fairly low the interior is a little small and could be cleaner but never anything to worry about the service is amazing here and they are very quick
  mediocre bland obviously low quality food sold for high prices to captive audiences stuck at the hotel first awesome views from the place it would be great for dessert second awful dirty silverware and glasses my butter knife had gunk on it that started things off on the wrong food y wine glass had lipstick and water marks the amuse buche had been in the fridge so long it had that familiar funky aftertaste it was the best course the rest was so unremarkable its not worth writing about not bad just bland and boring oh and the wine list is weak
  so i never went to the place that used to be here even though i live right down the street manly due to the fact i always do a quick yelp search before i try something i went over to order something from pizzalicious but they had closed early i noticed that the chinese food place had a new name happy wok did another yelp search and it had overall positive reviews so i decided to give it a try ordered food to go for my boyfriend an i prices were very reasonable each entree came with the choice of fried rice or while rice picked the mongolian beef and tomato beef plus a large order of the egg drop soup took about 15 minutes to complete the order so not too long of a wait went home and had one of the best experiences with chinese take out the tomato beef was in a puree of tomato with lots of cut pieces of tomato as a tomato lover i was impressed mongolian beef was nothing short of a nice spicy kick you can tell that the chef really cares about his food which is something you don t really see in chinese take out at all oh and the fried rice portions are off the charts we still haven t finished a complete box overall great experience and delicious cheap to go food we went about a week later and tried different menu items wor wonton soup curry beef and honey walnut shrimp all items were delicious again
  my wife and i went there for a late lunch it was a busy sunday afternoon we were seated at the last table which was a tight fit and it backed up to their ice freezer which they filled up while we were eating i ordered the pork and mushrooms and my wife had the noodles and vegetables she had specifically asked for a plate with lots of vegetables but was sorely disappointed the noodles were salty and the vegetables were non existent my pork dish was good i like the menu choices and will give it another try because i like authentic chinese food this trip was so so
  can t beat happy hour all day every day excellent food great presentation the staff always makes us feel very welcomed super friendly people we come here several times a month and have been doing this for over a year
  4 6 12 my first visit and it s been a long time coming according to my bookmarks page i ve wanted to try chez vous since 4 25 2011 funny that it took almost a year to do make it over here liked the interior which is a mish mash of dark brown leather seats and tables near a playable piano i know bec i played long long ago on it and regular wooden chairs and tables across the display cases it is intimate and very cozy yet not too claustrophobic i met romain the affable young son of the owners of cv who informed me that he d just arrived from france less than two months ago i also enjoyed the music selections playing that morning and mentioned this to romain who replied that the music was from his ipod it was easy to like romain whose enthusiasm for music was clearly evident when he d sing along as he did his tasks ah how do i love the french accent too bad romain s a bit too young for me perhaps he has an older brother for my fist visit i ordered a cappuccino and a chocolate croissant to start http www yelp com biz_photos m9afzk1f8tsv248yerbpqa select 88ypfgok2frk_juiwxffzq 88ypfgok2frk_juiwxffzq and a chef s choice savory crepe for my main http www yelp com biz_photos m9afzk1f8tsv248yerbpqa select y_zuht95male5jd9efhgxq y_zuht95male5jd9efhgxq the cappuccino was beautiful to look at and delicious to taste the foam in it was perfect the chocolate croissant i was told was fresh from the oven although mine wasn t warm to the touch however it tasted marvelous and the crisp layers of the croissant revealed the freshness of the pastry i did order another croissant to go which had just come out of the oven it was all i could do to eat only half of the pastry since i still had the savory crepe to look forward to the buckwheat crepe was filled with warmed cubes of green apple and chevre and drizzled with honey and chives and it came with a side salad it automatically came with a brown sugar mustard dressing something i cannot have and which romain replaced with fresh salad and caesar dressing for me http www yelp com biz_photos m9afzk1f8tsv248yerbpqa select 5b0khkj_s6rit_1hruvvlw 5b0khkj_s6rit_1hruvvlw it was dee lish sweet enough to satisfy my sweet breakfast cravings yet not too sweet that the back of my lower jaw where it meets my ears hurts it felt a bit weird to have salad that early in the day but i tried it anyway in case it wilted before i had a chance to try it for lunch the dressing tasted very fresh and i asked if it had eggs in it to which romain replied that it didn t but didn t it taste like it did yes it does i truly enjoyed breakfast here and as you can see it wouldn t be too long until my next visit
  this was my first time at this restaurant everything was great the food service and the atmosphere i ordered the fillet mignon and it was perfect the mashed potatoes were the best i ve had yet our waitress was very attentive and sweet it was nice to see the manager on duty walking around and talking with the customers i will definetley be back again
  you know how you go to a place for the first time and its totally awesome then you go back sometime later and the experience is not as good then the first thats rio mirage in el mirage az the first time we stopped in this place was awesome they had the yummiest rice and beans as well as very good chimi s enchiladas etc but since the first time we ve been there it just hasn t been as good the rice dry and greasy the beans run of the mill food being burnt and greasy greasy greasy spotty service and in my opinion sub par ingredients make this place now an avoid what a shame too since they had so much going for them very disappointing
  the outside reminded me of mimi s cafe and automatically assumed that the food was going to be mediocre but i should always remember to not judge a book by it s cover as cliche as it sounds anyway it was my birthday and my parents wanted to treat me for a nice lunch to which we all decided after looking online at what cheddar s was all about to try it out when we got there the inside looked amazing a bit upscale and the menu selection looked inviting and i was happy about the combination choices as well given that i am that person that needs to try everything we ordered the stack of onion rings as an appetizer which was delicious i also ordered strawberry lemonade which was really good a bit on the sweet side though for an entree i had a half rack of ribs fried shrimp combo with fries and a side of mac and cheese which was amazing i would definitely come back for more
  local favorite and always stinking busy if your going to show this place off with a new friend go early or really late on the weekend or skip it beer is great food is above par for a place like this
  just want to update fellow yelpers on my experience with this establishment the owner tara personally messaged me on here to let me know the wi fi was fixed and to thank me for my business i am currently in ground control and everything is working great bumping my rating back up to 4 stars for the pro active communication and service by the owner of ground control
  this review is more based on customer service and a recent order than it is for the typical quality of their food usually the food is pretty good the last order was the tom yung pad thai and chicken pan ang all were ordered at a five spice level when i got the food home and we started digging in it was more like a 9 i called to let them know and they basically told me it was my fault for not knowing that the peppers right now are much spicier not sure how that is relevant if the peppers are spicier you put less in so that a five is a five not a nine they did offer to make a new order but that was not feasible so they offered to give me a soup the next time i came in a soup really i just spend 35 on food that was inedible and the compensation was a soup i told them that i would like a new order the next time i came in i was told i would have to bring in the old food for them to see so in order for this to happen the food would sit in the fridge for maybe two weeks then sit in my car all day and then i would bring it in to them so they cold look at it and then if they maybe thought they didn t believe me that it was too spicy they wouldn t credit this does not make sense i was going to do this but then i took it as an insult i won t say that i am one of their best customers but maybe once or twice a month this place is convenient but there are plenty of thai places that are just as good if not better so i figure i won t be patronizing them for a while
  overpriced food it didn t taste that good maybe because i was hungover however the view right in front of bellagio fountain that makes up for everything
  we tried this place on our anniversary and the lasagna was cheesy and just had a really good flavor they have this huge brownie sundae that we re definitely going to have to try next ti
  great food great service erica was excellent made great drinks and they took the aarp card ya yummy
  salty good god so salty maybe i just had a bad pasty or something but i never went back afterwords besides the flavor of salt there just wasn t a whole lot going on in one of these pasties sit in the window for god knows how long but i never once saw them putting fresh product out it might be nice to grab one on a winter day walking to work but i m just not sure it d warrant taking off my gloves to eat
  overall the food was good i had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac n cheese and the fried green tomatoes i do not have anything bad to say about the restaurant it s just not my favorite bbq in the area i am more of a fan of the tomato molasses bbq sauce and they only had vinegar based the sauce to me is what really makes the bbq sandwich and it just wasn t my favorite i would still recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area
  the latte was so good that i had to dish out my first 5 star for a coffee shop the latte they serve was truly exceptional even when i order it iced i draw my line for iced latte at about 20 below freezing i have no idea where they got a croissant from but that was incredible as well it s hard to imagine this being a chain store i m a huge fan of croissants and their croissants are well layered with buttery flakes this can t be good for my health but it s utterly delicious for my taste buds this is going to break my starbucks addiction while i m in montreal
  we went here for my husband s 30th birthday and it was great it wasn t the best i ve ever had the portion was huge and the meat was tender and juicy the only negatives were 1 too much butter for a good quality steak and 2 i asked for medium rare and the meat came out overcooked overall i would recommend it
  suzanne and my favorite restaurant in vegas especially when stone crab is in season the king crab and steak and everything else is also awesome
  wanna to switch it up from the same ole same ole dinning experience in vegas you should check out the barrymore it s located just off the strip near the encore it s located inside a small hotel and with a not so appealing outside do not let this stop you from checking this place out trust me when i walked in the barrymore i was stoked i found a gem and i know i won t be let down immediately to my right was an old school vegas lounge singer and his piano man i kid you not the singer said i m here every night except next friday i m taking my girlfriend out it was such a cliche lounge singer statement but it worked we were seated in their very cozy intimate main dining room our waiter promptly greeted us the barrymore has a very impressive wine list i opted for a glass of the whispering angel rose and found to be light and satisfying we were served with a basket of freshly baked breads and warm salted butter the breads were so delicious the basket was empty before we knew it with great will power we declined a second basket we choose all items suggested by our waiter we had scallops for our appetizer halla the scallop appetizer was something to write home about yum yum our main entrees bone in filet and chilean sea bass both items were good but i must say they were a bit on the over cooked side not too much but just enough to notice for desert we got the apple cheesecake tart thingy perfect size we were super stuffed but wanted to experience all courses offered another great suggestion from our waiter i can t say enough good things about the staff they made us feel welcomed and they cared about our experience it wasn t just our waiter checking on us even other waiters asked us with enthusiasm if we enjoying our dinning experience i can t wait to go back the barrymore is a really cool place
  stopped by cut for a quick cocktail and dessert before heading out to lavo great vibe decor fabulous staff and unique cocktails i can t wait to go to vegas and actually have a full meal at this restaurant
  i really hate comparing places like this to locations in san diego but vegas you ve got a lot to learn about craft cocktail creations if you re somewhat familiar with the district or gvr for that matter you probably know due and proper used to be the old al s garage now it s turned into what my brother likes to call the haunted mansion from disneyland the decor is cool the drinks are ok and the bartending isn t the best i came here on saturday and the place wasn t very busy yet i finally got the bartender s attention after about what seemed like 10 minutes and ordered a measly vodka soda after i got my order i found and studied the craft cocktails menu and noticed an intriguing looking drink called the dead rabbit this was a mix of carrot juice pepper and some other forgettable ingredients this drink had a beautiful color and great presentation but almost no flavor it s like getting a fancy sports car only to find out that engine is powered by your feet not worth the effort the rest of the night i stuck with vodka and soda this place eventually got packed but we were lucky enough to grab a booth from here on out it was another fun filled bar night the service at the booth was awesome almost too good because i walked out of due and proper feeling stewed and proper i will be back and upon my return i will try another craft cocktail i mean there s always time for a second chance hence the reason why you can update reviews right
  none better i ve probably eaten here 10 or more times with various groups of people and each time everyone involved was thrilled here are some rules of thumb for a happy experience 1 small crowded dining room with tile floor lots of noise so don t come here expecting explain the last ten years of your life to your half deaf grandfather 2 expect to wait in the meantime have a delicious margarita or three 3 get the guacamole worth every penny especially when pomegranates are in season 4 skip the bread it s a mexican restaurant after all 5 pork tacos or enchilada suiza are the best things on the menu 6 check out the restroom be inspired 7 if you don t like this place stop coming back so my wait will be shorter
  i have been to ticoz twice the first was to redeem my groupon the second was for happy hour both times the food was okay nothing to rage about 3 stars the kiwi sangria is a fabulous 5 stars very refreshing and not too sweet for a hot phoenix day the server and bartenders were friendly no complaints overall nice and casual happy hour place to visit
  urban beans how i do love thee the espresso shots are pulled to perfection and i ve never had a bad drink out of the 20 or so i ve had so far here the pastries and sweet treats are delicious the toffee is to die for the muffins make me melt the tabouli and hummus are delish the bagels are fresh the goat cheese torte made me lick the plate clean their smash drinks are amazing and i m partial to the s mores one better than dutch bros sweet coffee treats hands down the best part is that everything in here is locally made and environmentally friendly from the cups which are made from corn and totally compostable to the friendly down to earth staff that makes the place a truly great coffee spot so many other coffee joints in the area want to claim they are local and environmentally friendly and blah blah blah but really the most they can lay claim to is that their coffee comes from somewhere in az virginia the owner really prides herself on obtaining everything in the places from locales with all the coffee options out there make urban beans your first choice
  terrible experience walked in and there were only three tables with customers all the rest were filthy food on them sticky the floor was just as bad the drink station was sticky and covered in soda and there were more employees than customers in the store most likely the worst panda i ve ever been in the food was hot but didn t seem fresh
  loved it impromptu stop while driving through charlotte and what a fantastic choice menu was simple and easy to understand although i relied on the expertise of my date in ordering plates arrived quickly at first i thought the serving size was a bit small but it ended up the perfect amount the pad thai was surprisingly sweet but still excellent atmosphere was cozy and very authentic a definite new favorite when traveling through charlotte
  i was really delighted with this meal the restaurant is very nice looking for starters my martini was excellent the ceasar salad and onion soup were great but the filet mignon was prepared so excellently that i was able to cut it with a butter knife it also tasted amazing the service was great too i did not have dessert so i cannot comment on that i would undoubtedly return here next time i am in vegas other meals i had were at wynn and encore and this one was much better
  this chipotle is my family s absolute favorite we go here about 2 3 times a week the employees are very friendly and know us by name we love chipotle
  went in for breakfast the first time service was very slow but the food was good expensive but its vegas so didn t really mind that much went in again for late night around 2 am service was once again slow but they were very nice and welcoming i would give them a higher rating if the service was better
  stopped in on saturday for some pre gaming before the asu vs wisconsin game we have been here a few times before but never on a football saturday it was about half full when we got there but by the time we got our drinks the bar was filling up pretty quickly the bartenders looked a bit flustered with the crowd but i would think they were making good tips since 90percent of the crowd were wisconsin fans vacation money spend it all we had a 4 hurricane which hit the spot after that we had one of the frozen drinks was perfect for the heat can t remember which one but whatever has the most booze in it they also offer the nfl sunday ticket but i only counted 8 tv s so i can t imagine this place on a sunday i ll be back but probably not till fat tuesday
  good everything is good the cashew chicken and wantons are always a personal favorite
  this is my new favorite mexican restaurant a sweet family runs it with the son in the front of the house and mom in the kitchen to start the chips and salsa are top notch something so simple can vary greatly but the complexity of flavor in the salsa and the fresh crispy chips make these stand out as one of the better versions i ve had the shrimp here are especially fresh and the restaurant takes a lot of care in cleaning and preparing them they may be small but they are plump and tasty i recommend trying them in the aguacaliente ceviche style either chopped on a tostada or whole in the full appetizer version or the chipotle entree style fajitas are hit or miss once the veggies were overcooked with far too much oil but they do come with a nice added touch of a little quesadilla on top house specialties are done well but i find myself coming back for the shrimp all entrees are served with deliciously authentic beans for the value you d be hard pressed to find a better mexican seafood restaurant in town i highly recommend mariscos playa escondida
  best wings in charlotte great drink specials as well as an excellent staff same crew has been working here for years so you know it s a good spot can t really go wrong with any of the wing flavors however my favorite are cajun and lemon pepper you have to try the hot gold though it s their most popular i believe when in doubt go for the sampler 25 wings 5 different flavors don t let the shopping center fool you this place is a gem
  awesome tacos al pastor definitely the best i ve and in awhile and i travel to mexico often straight outta tijuana too stop here because it is absolutely worth it
  classic bistro a bit off the beaten track for us not to bad of a walk from the metro place was hopping and had to wait for about 30 min to get our reserved table but worth it had a drink at the bar and were seated before we could finish our drink service was excellent nice menu and all cooked to order and fresh see picks not many comments on the calves liver but you ever want to try it this would be the place nice wine selection by the glass was fine for us no room for desert but had a truffle just right price point is fair absolutely will be back
  they have a very good selection of goodies i appreciate that most of their items are portioned out so not of lots of people going through the food like at other buffets where serving spoons fall into the food in the trays yuck
  of all the meals i ve had in my life this is the first one in which every single course has been perfect i ate here about a year ago and have only recently gotten around to writing reviews of all the restaurants i ve been to however picasso was first on my list it s tucked away in a lower partition of the bellagio so it s easy to pass up on a quick walk through we were seated at the outdoor patio overlooking the pond this gives you one of the best views of the water show to be had on the strip however you won t be able to view any of the artwork of the restaurant s namesake if you walk around inside you can see many of the original picasso works from several periods the staff was extremely polite and attentive as would be expected from a michelin two star restaurant the patio s head waiter was spot on for all of our needs i ordered the tasting menu and both of my friends opted for the vegetarian prix fixe the somollier suggested a riesling so we ordered a bottle he knew what he was talking about because it matched well with both my dinner and the vegetarian plates good job my amuse bouche was a lobster soup that was smooth and silky the u 10 seared scallops were large and perfectly cooked the foie gras however was mind blowing my tongue was crying with joy and at the same time hated me i haven t had any before nor since that caused me to get emotional the seared halibut was also fantastic and seated over a ragout of mushrooms when dessert came we loved their presentation and the taste i had a molten chocolate cake that oozed with goodness my friend liz had some some of strawberry amazing something rather i wanted to steal it but her glare let me know that this was not the place to start a fork battle overall i wouldn t hesitate to recommend this restaurant to cap off a trip to vegas for three of us with wine the check came out to be around 650 so budget accordingly the dress code is dressy to business casual though this didn t stop a group of people from coming in with shorts and flip flops while yapping on their cell phones the whole time jerks
  if you re reading this while standing in a ridiculously long line suck it up because it s worth it you ll forget you even waited that long once you ve inhaled the combo pan roast which you finished eating in less than 15 minutes
  good atmosphere been here both for lunch and dinner casual fun and great place to watch the sporting event of your choice oh and the food killer fries and a truffle burger that will cause you to screw the diet just to have more of this wonderful ness on a bun
  really cute restaurant in trendy shadyside good for a first date i liked the art and conversation cards on the table i m vegetarian and this was actually my first time trying cashew cheese i had the fall menu beet ravioli pierogis and roasted veggies with brown rice everything tasted fantastic truly pleasantly surprised to try the coconut sour cream we also got a french press they only had medium roast but it was roasted specially for eden by a local pgh company and it was delicious the entree portion sizes were good but the appetizer was a little expensive imo for dessert i had the pear sorbet and my husband had a brownie parfait pricy but worth the experience if you don t normally make food like this our deserts were sweetened with dates and honey you definitely don t leave eden feeling weighed down or sleepy for 55 we got a french press two smoothies an appetizer two entrees and two desserts all vegan all delicious i m happy
  after moving from california to new york 8 months ago i ve had to deal with the complete lack of in n out deliciousness sure new york has plenty of great alternatives but nothing is a replacement for in n out there s not much to say about this particular location except its nice and close to the airport and the two times i went there was almost no line which i ve never experienced in ca vegetarians order a grilled cheese animal style and some fries and you re set
  i liked this place v much when i went with a friend he ordered all you can eat for us both yummy the food came fast the service was on point the guy who helped was courteous and well spoken they are always busy and i can see why
  really enjoyed this place on par with any korean i ve had in ny where i m from but with better prices i ordered takeout at the restaurant and the order was ready quickly the guy at the register made friendly convo while i waited stayed at nearby m montreal hostel which is just a short walk away if you re looking for a takeout place in the neighborhood i highly recommend this
  there wasn t one thing we had that wasn t really good we started off with the baked mussels i crave them they were so flavorful without being too much too saucy the bread is complimentary and i love sourdough but even more when served warm with butter yum we tried the salmon and the mahi both dishes were delicious we all licked our plates clean the service was outstanding water was kept filled and we never had to hunt down our waitress we will definitely be eating here again
  awesome food awesome service cocktails are great ask for mike my wife keeps dragging me here
  unless you are looking for a completely uninspired breakfast experience i would give the gateway restaurant a miss i had heard that lunching here was recommendable and so i hoped that perhaps breakfast might be worthwhile of course the venue is beautiful located as it is in the john hope gateway but warming the croissants could not mask how stale they were the aberdeen buttery did not seem much fresher the stacked scotch pancakes were unimaginatively presented do not expect the wait staff to be able to provide any details about the presence of nut contamination in any of the food despite the menu stating that they will the reason that our waitress could not give us any details about possible nut contamination of course was because all pastries are bought in from outside this is not the first time i have been confronted with this issue and i still find it unacceptable that a restaurant even if a food item is brought in from a bakery cannot furnish the customer with details of ingredients or other information relevant to the food item most disappointingly i suppose was the fact that the food was not made in house why is it that a restaurant cannot bake make its own food i assume that they do have a kitchen and cooks i know from personal experience that a scone a pancake a loaf of bread are not complex undertakings in the kitchen i cannot fault the wait staff they were pleasant enough though some training from management might have been in order for our poor waitress was most thoroughly stumped when we asked her to enlighten us as to what an aberdeen buttery was pleasant service though cannot make up for poor quality food so if you want to impress out of town guests serve them a nice breakfast at home and head straight to the botanic gardens bypassing the gateway restaurant
  different from all the reviews my experience was not that great food was over pricey over rated i would say they must concentrate on one cuisine rather than having everything on the menu also the name says cafe for it to be a cafe the food and prices is inappropriate i would suggest it must concentrate on being good at one rather than being all over the place
  awesome little restaurant in phoenix area food very upscale and 5 star service excellent waitress knew the menu and explained best options would recommend this restaurant and would definately return although they are pricey you get what u pay for and it is well worth it
  2nd time ordering delivery from here 1 word fantabulous amazing indian food around 40 for 2 people to eat it s affordable especially for the portions easily could feed 3 hungry adults with one combo for 2 or 2 main dishes with polao rice which would each add up to about 40 delivery took about an hour but so worth it absolutely must have their nan bread it is perfect with every dish and every sauce can t wait to go eat in house cuz it s byow and the food is fantastic and hot delivery so it can only be better there so far staff seem pretty polite and friendly definitely recommend this place
  the food was enjoyable for everyone in our party with the exception of the vegetable platter which tasted like unseasoned microwavable veggies the thing that really bothered us though was when the tab came out with a 7 charge for the entertainment who didn t even start playing until after we left the manager said we still had to pay it which left a foul taste for us on this restaurant
  we have found that you can t go wrong with echo rig for brunch lunch or dinner their customer service is on par and you are always met with a smiling face must haves include appetizers portobello fries yum brunch eggs benny smoked salmon unlimited mimosas lunch dinner drunken goat sandwich jumping beef wood roasted salmon they surely are not skimpy with their portions you get what you pay for overall echo rig is a fun place with customer service that will not disappoint sit out on the outdoor patio upstairs for a quiet date night
  went around brunch time with a party of 5 on a saturday and was seated within a few minutes i was excited to try their food but was a little let down pros waiter jose was very nice and friendly it seemed as if they were under staffed that day as he was serving many tables at once but he was still very helpful clean restaurant interesting decor food portions were huge tasted just okay cons although portions are huge food is just okay nothing great we had two orders of the egg benedict not sure if it was noted on the menu came with a type of red spaghetti sauce which was rather odd to us extremely rude busser wasn t pleasant or friendly at one point the guy on the table next to use asked him for the check since he was the only one there at the moment and he replied in a harsh manner i m not your waiter and continues to do what he was doing he could of at least said let me get your waiter for you overall experience was okay don t think it ll be on our must do list next vegas trip
  i love the ambiance of the restaurant and the high volume of staff to keep things moving it was busy but the service remained fast and friendly regardless of the high volume of people there what i didn t love was the salad and the lack of discussion about what i was ordering they prepared me a small salad i wanted a large but couldn t tell what they were doing once i realized it was a small it was too late also the added items chicken egg tomato etc was way too small of a serving for a lunch i was less than two bites of chicken maybe 1 2ounces total and about 1 4 of a hard boiled egg i m not a big eater but i was pretty hungry when i left the restaurant also way too much dressing it was drowning in dressing they were so focused on keeping the line moving and i understand they need to get people through at lunchtime but they didn t take enough time to let me make decisions about my order large salad not small extra chicken please less dressing etc it could be great if they improved the service at the counter and actually gave people a moment to order what they want and if they consider actually adding a decent serving of ingredients to the salads
  great food even though they are far away from where i live its worth going to
  i always love to try new places especially when it involves friends and a few libations i was hesitant to try this place at first because of mixed reviews i had heard but what the hell you only live once right so on the fateful night of my first blue martini experience i was surprised to see that there were a slew of door hosts dressed in suits who guarded the front door that were secured with ropes at first i thought i had mistakenly had gone to a club on the strip and not a restaurant in town square but i guess that s what happens at the latest locals hot spot my party crew and i sat outside and i must say i was very surprised with the vibe and beautiful people that surrounded this place the majority of the patrons were locals and hot locals at that forget ordering food i could just fill up on the eye candy of men in suits that were sipping on martinis and wine speaking of martinis and wine i was impressed with the selection any place that serves sonoma cutrer by the glass is alright in my book so of course i had to pair the wine with my first appetizer which was the assorted fruit and cheese plate i could have every different type of cheese everyday for the rest of my life but this one i could do without i was expecting a expanded variety of cheese like gruyere or even a brie but was left disappointed so to drown forget my disappointment i had to indulge in a martini or two when in rome when it comes to martinis i like them dirty i mean like nc 17 rated dirty the masterpiece bleu was great ultimat vodka and blue cheese stuffed olives with added olive juice the blue cheese tasted fresh and martini s size did not disappoint there was some left over liquid love in a martini shaker on the side now i am not the fruity martini drinker but one of my martini comrades had the the good life martini and might i say after taking a sip it was pretty damn good if you like that kind of sweet fare bacardi melon sugar free red bull and cranberry juice now i know what kayne west was taking about when he wrote that song it definitely welcomed me to the good life happy and content with my martini and wanting to make up for the disappointing cheese plate i had i opted to have the caprese salad i love caprese salads and try to have them everywhere i go and i must say this is one of the best i have had the buffalo mozzarella tomatoes and basil were abundant and fresh but the kicker was the fact that they added portabello mushrooms loved it what i did not love was the lobster taco great marinade and veggies but with one small piece of lobster in a gigantor tortilla i will make sure to stay away next time with that one all in all blue martini is a great locals escape away from the strip with good drinks great atmosphere and beautiful people and with happy hour 7 days a week how could you not like this place plus all you vegas service industry workers and hotel employees your first drink is on them with their blue martini vip card with that incentive they will definitely see my face more often
  i love the calzones here they re huge i took one to work and all my coworkers enjoyed it
  um delicious i don t think i ever knew i liked biscotti until enrico s during my first excursion to the strip i walked by a few times before i realized where the mouthwatering baked good smell was coming from when i walked inside i was surrounded literally by biscotti there were jars and jars trays and trays of them at first i didn t even notice the person hidden behind them willing waiting to help me i got a hodge podge of flavors pistachio cranberry chocolate almond peanut butter chocolate chip others i can t even remember 1 50ea there are some fancy shmancy ones that are drizzled in white or milk chocolate 1 75 proceeded to scoff approximately 4 of them in 2 days then return to bring some back to my office as a treat they didn t make it in quite the condition i got them in as i was forced to plane side check my bag thanks for that us airways jacka es who put their coats in overhead bins leaving no room for other people s precious biscotti however despite the less than perfect appearance my co workers loved them 4 5 stars if i could will try the cafe next time i m there
  solid breakfast burritos full of flavor they don t skimp on the meat and potatoes i also prefer tasting the tortilla and they deliver my friend enjoyed hers too but prefers more egg great to stop and go grab a quick bite after a hike no need to feel underdressed after writing all this a trip to the bathroom changed my feelings about coming here a backed up unmaintained rest room barf if that s how the public restroom is i can only wonder about the kitchen where my thoughts go
  went to eat here got a burrito and a hotdog it was just ok it wasn t as good as i thought it was gonna be the salad bar was pretty good except they didn t have the grilled onions so that was a letdown but all in all it was ok not as good as the ones in tucson
  two of us caught up with inka heritage during restaurant week and we re really glad we did the place was full except for one two top and there people standing outside it s a small place the standees must have been waiting for a large table we were seated immediately we ordered started with the ceviche and some yucca the yucca was basic and unadorned but hot and fresh the sauce almost a curry served with it was a great addition the ceviche is notable the fish was fresh and tender not mushy as is often the case when a long marinade time is used to cover for less than fresh fish the blend of onions and spices used have it some real zip without burying the fish my wife loved her mar pacifica the fish with crab stuffing was excellently balanced i sort of expected the shrimp to be overkill but they had their own distinct flavor to add to it all i had the lomo saltado too much saltado nice tender beef laid over sweet onion the sauce was rich and full but seemed to be mostly soy sauce not much vinegar tang there the result was way too much salt service was friendly but efficient our waitress always seemed to have a moment to spare at exactly the right time the room is small and cozy with warm yellow decor and long white drapes covering the store front windows all in all we had a very good dinner in a charming place
  sushi samba has a pretty delicious menu i am a big fan of the variety they had to offer the sashimi was extremely fresh each bite was a taste of buttery heaven the foie gras roll was one my favorite for the night along with the tuna and salmon sashimi pieces the place is yes pricey but it was an experience
  anyone who s anyone comes here to eat it s a no brainer the real question is are you a fan enough to wait in line and devour the delicious goodness this place has to offer combo pan roast 23 99 is obviously their specialty that everyone comes back for throw in the half dozen oysters for 10 and you got me sold this is my 2nd time here in a very long time you have to try this place out if you haven t
  naturally the first thing i do when trying out a new place is check out the reviews on yelp and when i checked it out for akahana many people mentioned how bad the service was i wanted to be the one who proved them wrong the one to show everyone that akahana would be my new wonderful go to spot with terrific service but i m sad to report i m not that person i don t know if it was because they are newer and are drawing in quite a crowd on thursday nights and the servers are overwhelmed but the service was almost non existent we practically had to flag down our waitress to give her our order get refills etc and i contemplated throwing a chopstick at our server to get her attention but with my luck that would ve either a turn into a lawsuit or b get violently ill from sushi gone wrong on the flip side 17 for two rolls a salad and a beer is a ok in my book the sushi holy wonderful fresh yummyness batman i was surprised by how fresh it was and how much flavor it had packed in the rolls some mentioned that the rolls on bogo nights tuesdays and thursdays were smaller but i felt they were appropriate sized pieces for what they are charging i can t remember the names exactly but got the furious dragon and sweet romeo roll the downside about bogo nights is that there isn t any vegetarian options on the bogo menu and it says no substitutions on the menu the vibe was good very vibrant with orange walls moderate volume music and packed they have a moderate sized bar area complete with the regular stuff you would expect espn japanese beers and specials galore i will be back to check out akahana but only when i have nothing planned afterwards so i won t mind waiting so long for my sush
  wow this place is a little hidden treasure inside of circus circus upon our arrival we received a complimentary bottle of house wine but that wasn t the best part the steak aged 21 days was excellent i m impressed both of our steaks were cooked to perfection the crab oysters and shrimp appetizers were great too but we were nearly full when the steak came the service was excellent the waiter checked in on us just the right amount of times and was very friendly there are many choices in las vegas to get a great steak but if you re in the area definitely stop by the steakhouse
  just had lunch here for the first time i had the daily special which is 2 giant slices with one topping each and a fountain soda for 5 bucks pizza was really good soft and chewy ny style crust not to much sauce and full of flavor the place is pretty tiny but they are adding a juice and gelato bar next door with a poker room the service was great the guy at the counter was really friendly and genuinely concerned that we enjoyed our pizza the place itself is pretty cool all of the walls have signatures doodles of customers chalkboard menus and counter and a couple of tables inside there were also a few tables outside but not much to look at all in all good food great service and cool atmosphere for a pretty good price i will be going back oh and they deliver bonus
  this guy puts his name on anything and lures people in it seems the wolfgang cafe was ok had the spaghettini and the chicken wing appetizer it looks like lamb at first but it was actually a chicken bone with the meat pushed down they try hard but the tastes are not hitting the spot i felt the service had room for improvement the food is not terrible here its average
  i ve only been here to see bands play for that purpose it seemed to be a bit of an awkward setup i would feel quite awkward trying to play a show here it s much easier being a patron it is indeed small and divey as a venue and just divey as a bar every drink was served in plastic cups when i ve gone that might change on different nights in the back they had a golden tee which i jammed my finger on almost 2 years ago and it s still fucked up and which kept shorting out in the middle of the game irritating it can be a pain to get in and out of because you have to make your way through clouds of smoke and people trying to watch the band in order to belly up to the bar also depending on how busy it is it can take awhile to get served if you re going to see the band you may want to note that the sound mix isn t the best also the acoustics in the place aren t very good either i do kinda like that it s not the easiest place to find i also like that it s a weird setup this place would rank pretty low on my list of favorable places to go see a band play but i wouldn t necessarily avoid seeing a band i like just because they are playing here
  it s my first time at tiffany s my friends had special decarie i had the crepe aux fruits with english cream both dishes were average i was disappointed with the crepe which was pretty chewy lacked freshness however the english cream was very good
  finally had a chance to try this place out the decor and atmosphere was good place was already popping at 5 30pm i guess everyone was getting their grub on right before the journey concert we ordered the lobster roll and split the bone 26 oz tomahawk ribeye steak we lobster roll came with 3 rolls cut in the middle and stuffed with a seafood salad mixture i don t know if there was actually any lobster in there since it was cut so small the roll was was nicely toasted and the stuffing was pretty good the ribeye came out with a pretty big bone sticking out that resembled something from the flinstones pretty prehistoric looking the tomahawk steak actually came from their ranch in montana it was tender and juicy pretty good but not the best for 46 i would have expected better tasting you can see your meat being grilled through a giant display window in the back of the restaurant it was a giant cowboy style charcoal grill the ribeye i had at marinelli s was better tasting
  stopped in for the first time this saturday to give it a quick try the bakery looked great and a wide selection of goodies but i was interested in the mexican cuisine generally when visiting a mexican establishment for the first time i order pastor tacos if they can t get that right what s the purpose of trying anything else i was not disappointed i ordered 3 tacos 2 each to go and they arrived in an appropriate amount of time the first thing i noticed was that they had corn tortillas i hate corn tortillas but shrugged it off and squeezed the fresh lime over the pastor tacos topped with fresh onions and cilantro and dived in it was delicious i have come to the conclusion that its not that i don t like corn tortillas i just have hated the ones that i have had in the past i associated corn tortillas with mealy and overpowering flavors but that would not describe these tortillas the portion was huge and my large appetite would have been more than satisfied with just two tacos i can t wait to give this place another try if i was a monona grove student which has an open campus i would be spending every lunch hour at this place
  my family and i just love this place it s our favorite family restaurant although they removed one of our favorite dishes the big ol ravioli but we always love the pizza the thing we particularly love about this place is the fair prices the unique and warm atmosphere and that the servers are always very personable we always arrive between 4 5pm and usually don t have to wait the outdoor patio is very pleasant we have probably dinned here 20 times and it s always been a good experience
  i really enjoyed myself at the wicked spoon for comparisons sake i also went to the bellagio s buffet for dinner we dropped by 8pm on a saturday to find a long line to get seated ended up waiting for almost 50 minutes adult dinner was 41 children was about 27 wicked spoon has the standard buffet fares like prime rib pastas etc where it differs is presentation and speciality items some of the exceptional highlights biy mac n cheese bar delicious various meats including shrimp that you could add pastas and whatnot served in miniature single serving sized pots uber cute variety of ethnic foods mexican east indian fun arrangement of desserts gelato macarons and exceptional cobbler among my favorites the custard boob thing was definitely the dessert the cons sushi was not good seafood selection wasn t particularly big or tasty getting seated in one of the u booths was a pita wicked spoon has a more upscale atmosphere than bellagio s buffet it definitely feels more special and vegas y between the two i d send you to wicked spoon if it s your only buffet visit highly recommended
  man where to begin first off i will start by saying that you should not be put off by the service staff initially they are all quirky and unique which sometimes gets misinterpreted especially when you are used to robot waiters with that being said pretty much anything you get from here is amazing i usually get the pizza margherita which is simple just cheese sauce and basil leaves yum the crust comes out nice and crispy but still slightly malleable so when you pick up a slice it holds its own weight until the very tip drips down with oodles of cheese going everywhere the slice is begging to be devoured if i m not in the mood for margherita i ll grab a sicillian slice and wow talk about next level awesome sicillian you are lucky if you ever taste anything like this in your existence if i don t want pizza period then i ll go with the spaghetti and meat sauce or the pasta primavera also if you get a chance pino is a really awesome dude too probably one of the nicest guys i ve met i m not sure if he actually remembers who i am when i come in but he definitely greets me like he does and also he is extremely passionate about his food and because of that he gets the 5 star rating
  it s really simple if you want chicken fingers eat at rock n roll there really is no equal high quality ingredients a delicious light batter for the frying and just about the tastiest special sauce you can imagine and really get the special sauce i know they have a bunch of others but in your heart of hearts you know what s right you can even get the fingers buffalo style i usually go half that way half normal which pairs with the special sauce quite well the guy who owns and runs the place is great too and gives out a free chicken finger to you and any new person you bring to try it out clean restaurant copious amounts of food and the best chicken fingers i ve eaten anywhere how in the name of all that is good is this place so overlooked
  showed up to order food to go hostess was super helpful person taking to go orders made sure i had all the plasticware utensils i needed also warned me about how spicy my pasta would be got a beer while i waited bartender was super prompt pretty sure they grated fresh parmesan on my to go food classy
  had dinner here with friends on may 6 i believe reservations were early 6pm got there early and had drink at the bar great variety no beers on tap but some interesting bottled beers our group shared a few apps i sampled the oysters which if i recall had a mignonette sauce which was excellent very bright tasting also had the lentils and squid the lentils were amazing and the squid perfectly cooked for dinner i had the pici pasta served with lobster tarragon almond chili pesto it was perfectly portioned but still a little heavy i paired that with a side order of broccoli rabe and a nice house chianti no dessert for our group others had the short rib dish which looked great but small service was fine the waiter seemed very knowledgeable great views in this hip hotel would recommend go again
  the place where 4 hour buffet happened 5 girls ate from lunch til dinner and changed server 3 times i don t remember what exactly we ate but i knew we sure ate all of our money s worth best part maracons for desserts devine left over cookies and naans at 3am post clubbing i didn t wear stretchy pants but i think the food has digested long before we went clubbing at haze best bang for your buck 20 lunch that lasted til dinner time
  not impressed i was very excited for this restaurant amidst all the hype and reviews the big buddha especially was appealing we considering just popping by for the club at first but decided we may as well just eat here instead boy do i regret that first the service for a high scale populous touristy area such as where tao is located i would except only the best of service this started on the wrong foot when my party was running 15 minutes late and called out of politeness to notify and apologize to the restaurant like we always do here s a first when i asked if our reservation could be pushed back by 15 minutes due to a slight delay the hostess replied 15 minutes should be okay any later and it s up to the manager s discretion on your reservation what what kind of bs rudeness is this i can understand that for a top notch restaurant space is limited and therefore any outrageously late reservations no shows will be given to people who have been waiting for a seat but we were only 15 minutes late and by the time we arrived there was no one waiting in line that just added salt to the wound if there had been an extremely long line with multiple aggravated parties waiting to be seated sure but don t spout some bs to us over the phone and cause us to rush when it wasn t even needed with a passive aggressive threat to our reservation also during my reservation we had requested a seat next to the large buddha granted i understand requests are not always given but it was for my girlfriend s graduation dinner and the fact that there were empty seats around the buddha when we passed by it made me wonder what exactly the manager does when training his employees on the ideals of service nevertheless we spoke up when they attempted to seat us in some dark corner and waited while the hostess discussed with another our seating preferences and reseated us after 2 3 minutes moving on the decor they get an additional star for this otherwise this would have been a one star review as a tourist we love seeing flashy new things my camera is always ready in my hand first they had multiple beautiful rose petal water baths in the entrance for visual pleasure of course the light was dimly set but not dark enough where you can t see a thing due to the illuminations of all the other decor aside from the various asian inspired ornaments we saw the big buddha was again the most appealing factor of this restaurant definitely bring a camera if you re the type who wants to see things like this it ll be one of your only high points of the night third food meh pf changs puts the same amount of flavor for 1 3 of the price it s basically just heavy msg foods with some fancy names and more expensive types of food such as lobster i won t go too deep into what we had but our party had a variety of different types ranging from sushi rolls to lobster to fish the fish was the best it was flaky with a great texture and the right amount of sauce everything else fell far below my expectations fourth price ugh 35 40 per entree and i feel as if i could get most of this from my local chinese take out minus some expensive stuff like lobster however just because you offer a few expensive dishes doesn t mean you can charge premium price if the taste isn t there it s not worth it if the service is subpar it s not worth it i would have been fine with tao possibly giving it 3 4 stars if these dishes are maximum 20 but for what we got a rehash of what we could get anywhere else for up to 40 hell no summary unless you really need to fill your tourist bucket list and see the big buddha avoid this place
  it s easy to be snobby about dennys but you know what this is better than 80 of breakfasts on the strip and it ll cost you 7 on my last morning in vegas i decided to branch out and try the american diner at new york new york and it was a pale shadow in comparison and cost at least twice as much the food is bang on the money diner fare that ll keep you going for the rest of the day and everyone who works there is friendly and competent sure if you want to have a leisurely breakfast you could head over to mon ami gabi over at the paris and you should at least once but if you want to eat well and get moving dennys has your back
  had a wonderful meal at this new restaurant my dining partner and i ordered the chicken brochette and the chicken tagine the brochette was like a shish kabob with pieces of chicken on two skewers the chicken was tender perfectly cooked juicy and had the most wonderful flavor from the marinade the brochette was served with rice and a stuffed tomato half which were both delicious the chicken tagine is like a stew of tender pieces of chicken with potatoes in a slightly spicy sauce very tasty the chef also sent out to our table a pastilla which is round baked phyllo pastry dough stuffed with chopped chicken almonds and eggs and sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon it may sound like a strange combination of entree and dessert but the sweet and savory flavors went together so well we finished it all the atmosphere is lovely and even better was the belly dancing performance we had a great time and had some wonderful food at a very reasonable price the restaurant is located on sahara and durango behind the outback steakhouse i highly recommend giving this place a try
  this place is tiny but its a tiny delicious gem the owner greeted us and was very friendly we chatted with him and the chefs as they were making our food we ordered the waffles with brei and grapes along with the veggie benedict and both my husband and i were shocked by how good the food tasted everything was made from scratch and you can tell this food is quality i was so full by the time we left but sad at the same time because my taste buds wanted more delicious
  wow be careful not to order too much my pancake loving daughter could only eat 1 of 3 of her buttermilk pancakes with herbed lemon butter my wife s egg benedict was so good she finished first place in the clean plate club orange juice is fresh squeezed and very delicious
  3 75 stars for me very solid sushi place that jason another friend and fellow yelper introduced me to sure i m a sushi snob a self proclaimed amateur wannabe michelin food inspector who enjoys all types of japanese food here s the deal here for 13 95 you can have ayce for lunch which is a solid offering you have a set menu to order from which has a healthy selection first item selected was the green salad with what tasted like their sesame white sauce dressing this was fresh healthy and crunchy the highlight as agreed upon were the vietnamese style fresh rolls with the sesame flavoured white sauce the sushi rolls to me were okay for me the sushi rolls were nothing spectacular the rolls were just above average for me to be amazing for me it s the texture of the rice and the freshness of the ingredients which was okay but not earth shattering trust me jason when you eat amazing fresh sushi you will know it seriously though for the price it s a great deal you get much less stellar sushi at sushi shop or yuzu for the same price so you have a bigger selection here on the menu and it s all you can eat hope this place stays here for a whole and doesn t raise prices excellent value for the money in what jason calls restaurant chain dominated laval
  had a great lunch there the decor is very much like crazy grandpa but grandma makes a great burger and awesome sweet potato hush puppies
  ok this place is awesome we got the grilled chicken pot stickers which were done to perfection and then i had chicken pad thai and my husband got the chicken panag i think that s what it was called i couldn t believe the amount of flavor in each bite i highly recommended them and i will be a regular from now on
  will never order again supposedly we got chicken chow mein but i can t confirm it was actually chicken we also got beef with broccoli broccoli seemed safe but not sure what they grey meat was that came with it never will order again
  i of course had to give the new location a chance being closer to me is a big draw to wanting to like yardhouse 2 it was reverse hh but a tuesday and pretty packed for the time and day of the week we didnt have to wait for a table which was a plus but i can see to definitely avoid during the weekend if its this busy on a tuesday sure i can agree with matthew c crowd assessment i felt like i needed a wider bicep width and a collar to pop but you know what people trying to be so hot and cool arent going to stop me from a good craft brew draft i m here for beer and drinks and just hope for good service obnoxious looking but i ll just smile watching them with their pitchers of bud light and gingerly sip on my lovely brews i enjoy watching a clusterbitch fuckshow so long as i don t get pulled into it we didnt feel like drinking too much so we shared their ommegang seasonal i asked what the seasonal was and the server was not so sure except i d like to say it is a summer ale it might be a seasonal to the yardhouse but it was not what is seasonal for ommegang currently it was ommegang abbey ale a classic yearound dark belgian brew grabbed some appetizers to share garlic noodles w shitake mushrooms a favorite we always order this since its simple but good it reminds me a bit of crustaceans garlic noodles those are better but i m not going to drop 80 to have some damn noodles and crab very often i kinda have my own take of this that i make at home if you re looking for traditional asian noodles this is fusion and not it and why d you come here for that anyways when we have spring mtn authentic establishments seared ahi tuna sashimi the sauce taste much like the cajun albacore spices that are put on nigiri but in sauce form it s not bad the fish was fresh and it went well with the garlic noodles the sauce got a bit much though after a while and i just want to taste the fish maybe sauce on the side moo shu eggrolls i can see why i saw it on many tables since many people love an eggrolls crunch creamcheese and chicken and sauce but it s just not a favorite of mine it goes on my okay list theres these thin orange garnish in the bowl try it it s either sweet potato or carrot we had good service here our server was nice and checked on us enough though we had to wait a little to find her for the check she came right back to grab our tab and got us on with our day in a jiffy other than your main server there are many helpers who watch your drinks and take away plates so our iced teas were never empty they were pretty ninja about it actually i honestly don t recall seeing my drink refilled one of the times or when one of the empty plates disappeared i think with how packed this place is this is a great system to have bussers also refill or it would be stressing chaos on the server and plenty of unhappy people waiting for things i ll definitely come back it s a lot busier on a weeknight that town square and i wish it was a bit quieter but hey it s either drive way down there for less of a crowd or drive a few minutes for a goose island matilda and garlic noodles i ll take the short drive until i reach my goal of having gone through all the craft brews on tap we are halfway so we still have much to go
  i haven t eaten at this restaurant but i can rate their poor service and their lack of integrity i purchased their groupon for the 7 course taster menu perhaps they sold too many of these because they have had no availability for people to come in and redeem their groupons i called 4 times over the course of 3 months with numerous dates and times that i was available to come in and each time they had no availability on the last call after informing me that there was still no availability the manager informed me that the deal would expire at the end of the month and that there was only one time slot left on a weeknight that i could take to redeem the groupon he was rude and made no apologies and no concessions when i protested that it was unfair to no longer accept the groupon deal i found his manner of addressing me completely offensive i accepted the last available slot and i am going to eat there since i have already paid for the meal hopefully their busy schedule is evidence that their food is at least worth it but i doubt it will be worth the trouble it has taken to get inside the door at the very least i heartily discourage purchasing any groupon that they post in the future
  this place is just really really good it may be pricey but i am a believer in you get what yo pay for fresh ingredients always cooked just right flavorful and delicious every time i go fast turn over times when i am picking up and taking my food to go great service the few times i have eaten in the dining area i always recommend this place as an east side of phoenix must try
  i hate cilantro but their guacamole was so good i got over it had fish and shrimp tacos so tasty this is my bestfriend s fav spot when ever we travel to vegas finally got to eat lunch here and i was impressed only 4 stars coz i asked for no dairy or cilantro for allergy reasons and i wasnt offered a substitute bummer but food was good enough to not complain since i know my dietary restrictions sometimes can kill it
  first time to have bbq in las vegas i think not the best choice but it was the closest it was just ok if i were wasted it probably would have tasted amazing the ribs were by no means what so ever falling off of the bone in fact some effort needed to be applied to tearing it off sides were just okay however it is pretty much what i expected it to be and that is mediocre to go service was pleasant and fast i m glad i didn t spend more than 20 on this i doubt i will be back
  i meet up with my husband here for lunch since we both work nearby you have to get here early before 1130 or the lunch crowd will have you waiting a while for a table especially if you are bringing a group food and drink are basic but good sometimes the service is a bit slow but it s not intolerable
  sometimes when something is overhyped you set yourself up for disappointment i wish i had visited maize before i had heard anything about it i think my expectations were too high after reading reviews it sounds like the prices have gone up since opening and it is not necessarily a bargain the parking lot is very small and awkward since it is on the corner of a fairly busy intersection the staff is super friendly and helpful and will answer any questions you have if you are short on time this is a great place to go since the food comes out fast unless you have to wait in a huge line to place your order i tried a fish taco and a pastor tlacoyo both are items i have not seen on menus at mexican restaurants around town they were both very tasty and authentic the sauce on the pastor tlacoyo was delicious and i was delighted by the authentic cheese and crema topping chips and salsa were good but they re not my favorite in town i would go back and try their torta and any entree that has squash blossom or huitlacoche
  coopers always delivers the soup is different daily and delicious each time did i mention the vast array of beer one more great thing coopers is well known throught the community for connecting the community to its farmers
  some of the best tasting pizza i have found in pittsburgh so far that delivers also i think the secret is in their crust i was ordering from rialtos for a long time until i found out about conicellas every since than i only order pizza from conicellas they offer very reasonable prices and great customer service they only accept cash there product is worth every bit of it thanks conicella for great products keep up the good work don t stop making pizza
  love this place as well as their recent offspring prescott station consistantly good food and service we always enjoy sitting at the bar and having a casual dinner and drinks their wine selection is great as well as their other beverages thumbs up you won t be disappointed
  first time to tommy bahama in vegas and i will be back incredible selection of rums as in pages if rums from around the world the manager came by and gave us some recommendations and we were all happy with the options we chose the appetizer of ahi poke was delicious as were the coconut shrimp the grilled chicken and mango salad was excellent perfect combo of fresh and light with a nice grilled chicken breast the filet and the fish tacos were very good also a great refreshing drink option was the rum with ginger beer a little sweet but i wanted another i will be a regular with the drink selections and the great food i m ready to go back now
  i s the staple of las vegas burgers i had to go 5 stars because of the animal style fries it put it over the top
  i like jimmy johns i really like their tuna fish sandwich it is one of the best for a fast food sandwich shop there is another sandwich shop across the street that i like a lot more but when i am in the mood for tuna or my coworkers want to come here i will stop by they are super fast i will give them that there have only been a few times that i have been able to get my drink before they have my sandwich ready i am just not a super fan they are a thousand times better than the mega giant of fast food sandwich shops dumb way
  we were really hoping this place would be good but it wasn t i loved the look but the food was disgusting we ordered the crab dip which was gross and i ordered fettuccine which was canned and tasted awful the owner was nice and apologized but unfortunately you have to have good food with all the competition out there
  i ve been going here for years to both the restaurant and hookah lounge i love both the service is always excellent and the staff is friendly and fast i have met lots of great people here as well my favorites are the pizza athens fries and pita and hummus their moroccan tea is to die for but unfortunatley they don t serve it in the hookah lounge anymore only in the restaurant its a nice place to relax with friends
  i love the food here they call me the cookie monster so this place is an immediate fit for me with amazing cookies best i have had in az their sandwiches and bread bowl soups are also awesome the only thing i don t like is that they don t accept credit card anymore in this age i rarely carry cash but i understand why they made the switch 3 5 charge for them
  update man i love the food at komex their bulgogi tacos are some of the best tacos i ve ever had their teriyaki chicken is awesome and i still like the cute girl who works here my problem now is that the wait is really long i recently walked in to order a few tacos and stuff and i waited almost 40 minutes that s not cool still i like it here i ll just have to order my food ahead of time for my next trip
  was here on a business lunch with a colleague i had the arizona burger the bun was burnt stiff on one side and the burger and while good in theory was ok at best definitely could have done better i just don t understand why these places try and get fancy and butcher an american classic i don t need a fancy bun especially if it s burnt and if you aren t going to season the meat at least make up for it in other areas the fries and southwest sauce was pretty good though on another note there was a cold seafood bar near the kitchen so i m not even sure what theme they are going for here i can get surf and turf somewhere else not at a burger joint if i lived close i would give it another try but don t expect it to blow you away just another trendy burger joint in my honest opinion
  really good food and super friendly staff it was my first time going and i know i will be coming back really soon
  this place is located at the miracle mile shop in planet hollywood i came here cause my friend recommended everything with lobster cool my coworkers and i almost ordered the entire menu sadly to say the everything was okay nothing stood out to be spectacular it was expensive too lobster of course think the decent thing to eat here is the lobster roll 20 for large combo fries and a drink the mac n cheese lobster took 20 minutes to make and it wasn t that great at all it was simply just mac n cheese and they put lobster on top lobster was cold and didn t seem fresh at all lobster bisque soup was okay lobster salad i can make this dish better at home pass on this one just salad and topped of with lobster nothing crazy lobster and shrimp ceviche the only thing that was decent along with the lobster roll it was fresh and tasty but tiny lobsicle battered lobster on a stick tiny and nothing great all this was around 100 expensive expected way more i ll just go to earls of sandwich instead cheap and in the same area
  we just moved here from oh and to finally find a place as good as columbus was great the tarts was sooooooooooooooooooooo good and the kish was amazing as well
  we found that restaurant by walking by they had 16 00 buffet good deal they have more naan selection i haven t seen at any other restaurant service is okay slow they short staffed only 1 person doing all the work prices are very decent comparing to other restaurant in this area overall i will def go back again i love indian food
  just finished eating here and my oh my i only have nothing but good reviews for them i m from ca and moved to vegas 3 years ago and always look for the best southern food usually any restaurant we go to for southern food it can be pricey this place has the best priced food and the quality is great words cannot really explain how amazing the food is because you have to try it yourself the service is amazing as well and they are all very nice this is my new go to southern food spot for sure thank goodness i over tipped them a little bit before i even recieved my food they are so very welcoming i have already referred my friends to try out this hidden little gem i know they will not be disappointed
  highly likely i will not be returning first would you like to eat inside or outside and its the first day of the cold vegas weather we chose inside nevermind that the restaurant is completely open near the bar sure it s gorgeous and i m sure very nice on a decent day even the waitress was walking around with a coat is there a heater in here somewhere second took a good 15 minutes no exaggeration for a drink order i just got a simple glass of water it was refilled twice in my hour and a half stay spicy food makes me thirsty third ayce sushi okay okay thanks for charging us the lunch price even though it was after 3p but where s the fish the rolls were packed with rice it was getting stuck in my throat but could i wash it down with water no water glass is empty i ll give it to them on the nigiri garlic tuna and eel delicious although the eel is usually served warm in other restaurants i guess it was supposed to here too but after sitting out in the cold for a while it cooled down pretty fast my friend and i were only able to place 2 orders in and we stacked them up getting a server to the table was a chore of course getting the check and making sure we paid were very quick trips i would not recommend coming here maybe its a different story if you sit at the bar in the summer
  a lame lunch no crab no shrimp no any kind of shellfish disappointed little asian foo collection only thing i like is the gelato
  loved it my husband and i shared the veggie combo the spicy chicken and an extra helping of collard greens the food comes on a huge plate over a spongy like wheat pancake and several rolled up on the side which are used to scoop up the delightful food to drink we shared two different ethiopian beers the total bill came to only 33 and change the only downside is the neighborhood is a bit sketchy other than that it is well worth going back
  fabulous location always well staffed and service is always above average despite the long lines
  proof that a chain can be consistent i ve found it i was staying down the street on business and stopped in one night for a quick burger the experience here was just like the ones at home super friendly people they are quick to greet you the second you walk through the door burger was tasty c mon it s a fast food burger so i m not hailing it as the best thing ever but as far as paper wrapped food goes these are pretty darned good
  i love butters and i hate breakfast i ve been to scottsdale twice and went to butters twice that sums up how much i love this place they have great fresh orange juice they refill their syrup for every table as soon as the customers leave everyone loves a full jar of syrup it s the little things that make me happy it s quite popular among the locals the second time i had to wait 30 minutes for a table but it s worth it go here
  my husband loves their pizza i m more of a chicken fingers kind of person hit and miss i ordered medium could not eat them they were so spicy ordered at 6 50 p m arrived at 8 15 p m on a tuesday night it s always interesting to see when they arrive however my husband loves the pizza so we wait i have no real serious complaints just know it will usually take longer to arrive and if you veer from the pizza it may be a challenge to eat
  i have a few favorite mexican places that i rarely stray from but i had a friend in town for ces staying at the luxor and this is where she wanted to go we didn t have reservations and the place wasn t busy but the hostess sat us at a counter like space facing out towards the casino and rooms our server was super friendly and the food came out fast so no complaints there i ordered carne tacos and my friend ordered chicken fajitas we also both ordered a glass of sangria for a 15 plate of tacos it was a very small portion 3 tiny tacos with what looked like mexican rice and black beans the mexican rice was not good and tasted like something you would make out of a box i m not a black beans fan so i can t comment on that the tacos were okay like something i could get at roberto s for a couple bucks the sangria was overly sweet and not worth 8 overall it was over priced for just okay mexican food
  this place is absolutely fantastic the green sauce and the chicken compliment each other so well i definitely recommend the service is also really good if they know you are new they will explain everything to you and make sure that you understand this place is exactly like chipotle just a little less corporate this place is a must visit even if it is just once
  my friends and i woke up starving this past sunday morning and wanted to find a place that was within walking distance of the hotel we found le gros jambon near the top of the yelp reviews so we headed over there i knew this place was legit as soon as i walked in the door this diner is so small that there are no tables there s only a bar on the left facing the grill and a bar on the right against the wall the breakfast menu is very short there were only four or five total items available i ordered the juevos rancheros and they were perfect we also order the daily special to split between us since we couldn t resist the offer of chocolate chip peanut butter pancakes they were outstanding and a perfect dessert everyone on the waitstaff was super friendly i love that this place is so close to my hotel because i definitely plan on coming back here when i m not in a rush to get to work
  you know those places that you love and want to review because its so great but they aren t so popular or at the height of what could be its popularity yet and if you and the others who love it review people will flock and at some point it will 1 get crowded and 2 just wont be your secret little haven anymore well that is what sambalatte is for me i have been in vegas 6 years and longed for a coffee joint that is not starbucks or coffeebean i found sambalatte and have been in heaven ever since the atmosphere is welcoming and homey there is a great upstairs area that is good for bigger groups but i prefer to sit outside the staff is so friendly and very helpful the coffee delish creamy and not bitter and served with pretty coffee art i have only had the macaroons and the quiches but i can say both are phenom the quiches are buttery and flaky with just the right amount of egg and fillings i have had the veggie and loraine though the veggie is my fave and the macaroons are bite size with just the right amount flaky crunch before you sink your teeth into the gooey center at this point sambalatte is by far my favorite coffeehouse in las vegas it is such a delight and i am so happy to have found this gem enjoy
  though we love qdoba in general this location specifically left me unimpressed the young lady who fixed our food skimped on everything and then she managed to appear to scan my frequent eater card without actually doing so the points never appeared on my card my bad that i couldn t find my darned receipt later to prove to corporate that we d actually eaten there no worries though because this location is totally out of our radius we were only there that day because our daughter had an activity in the area and we love qdoba the free concert in the square and the ice cream from the shop close to the parking lot totally made up for it mid july visit
  fantastic dinner i always order off the black board specials and have never been disappointed great service fun atmosphere and fantastic restaurant manager will be back your chianti beef is the best in town
  great cocktails comfort food well trained staff the upward folks have four places nearly adjacent to each other on central all are packed and all are successful postino windsor joy ride and federal pizza hallmarks of all are friendly staff reasonable prices consistent food and a fun casual atmosphere with good music
  i have been to which wich plenty of times it is in my top 5 of sandwich shops they have awesome flavor to their subs my favorite is their buffalo chicken they have so many different choices the shop is unique in how you order but i love it you pick a bag mark what you want on your sandwich and they make it they call your name when it is ready the only con it can get busy fast so the tables are taken and there is not much standing room without thinking you are in the way grab a table quick also get the club card you get a free sandwich after buying so many i hope they open one on the south side soon
  i went to salut again and as the novelty of this place is starting to wear off i still really enjoy this place they have a genuine feel to this place that i really like i enjoy the food the selection of wine and beer but mostly i do enjoy the service i started off by trying the odell 90 shilling ale from colorado which i might have had before but i enjoyed it after mingled a while with an empty glass i wanted to try the pumpkin ale they have but they ran out instead i tried a strange beer with a name like magic hat the awesome transylvanian behind the counter wanted me to go for a super hopy number but i wouldn t let myself be persuaded after happy hour i was however talked in to stay for dinner and i had the chicken panini and also a half of the brie hive so good with the greek fries very tasty i must say this was my third visit and i am still just as pleased with this place the food is good but the service is personable and knowledgeable and the ambiance intimate and mellow and these are the true selling points here
  this place is awesome the food is delicious affordable and made fresh seriously though the food is great they have tender and flavorful meat dishes and vegetarian options as well also that have a byob policy with cheap uncorking fee amazing the decor is cute and the staff was very kind i honestly can t wait to go back
  stopped in randomly tonight with a couple of friends always drive by and noticed how good it smelled but tonight was the first time i dined in my only regret not coming here sooner i had the ronin burger and was blown away we ordered garlic salt and pepper fries sweet potato fries shrimp chips and pickled vegetables for the table all of which were incredible the fries were complimented by some tasty dipping sauces and when it was all said and done i was completely satisfied and out the door for about 20 bucks including a beer to wash it down great food and affordably priced bachi burger is on my list to return in the very near future
  so after sitting for 30 min the service is horrible if u wanna pay for 39 dollars for steak so don t waste your time
  service was slow our food took forever and the kid s meals were wrong our rice was obviously old and re heated because the rice was crunchy not undercooked but from sitting all day in the kitchen the chips have some weird film on them basically our food was gross just don t bother going
  ate here for breakfast with my boyfriend it was our last day in vegas i was at first iffy about the place but i m glad my boyfriend convinced me to try this place food was very good the quality of the food made it taste more better we had a great server too very nosy and loud atmosphere but despite the noise overall the food was delicious
  i visited this place for the first time last night and had a good experience it is a revolving sushi bar not a 5 star sushi restaurant so don t get your hopes too high the sushi was delicious and there was a bunch of it on the belt so many options to choose from however if you re pregnant or can t eat raw fish you don t really have many options to chose from so buyer beware the chefs were constantly making new rolls monitoring food and our waitress was very helpful and always checking on us if you don t see a roll that you want they ll make it for you and give you the same plate price pretty neat the reason why i gave this 4 out of 5 stars was because this revolving sushi bar is a little more expensive than other revolving sushi bars the plates are about 0 75 more expensive then where i have been before teharu in scottsdale definitely give it a try but don t be a snob
  decent place understandably busy on a saturday night but patient with hungry customers vegetarian yet satisfying menu and reasonable prices
  a friend and i went to milo s on a friday night around 7pm there was a small group of older folks that looked like regulars but other than that it was eerily empty i was really looking forward to a good meal our young waiter eventually came out 5 minutes after being seated and he seemed a little out of sorts he looked a bit disheveled to be waiting tables but he was nice and polite my friend ordered a personal pizza and i went with something simple as well and ordered a burger first the pizza came out it looked like a small tombstone pizza but my friend did say that it wasn t bad then came my burger a very small very plain and very unimpressive burger arrived on large nicely salmon colored plate that s it the rest of the plate was as eerily empty as the restaurant itself i m just sitting there staring at my plate waiting for alan funt to break away from that ole crowd to tell me i m on candid camera 5 minutes later a different waiter comes to our table and again i m looking around for that little red light i pointed my plate out to the new guy and he said hmmm i asked for a menu because it just felt like there was something or a lot missing to this meal i showed him that there should have been 2 sides i ordered just the fries 5 minutes later our original waiter came out with the fries and nervously apologized for the err i was very understanding to his face but my insides were screaming for the manager i would be embarrassed to be the manager or the owner to send a plate out like that at a place like this let alone anywhere else is unacceptable that food and a 2 beers tip cost 50 no i will not be back i had originally wanted to go to escobar s and while i was in the restroom before the food arrived i noticed they had a flyer on the counter advertising for escobar s i found this to be odd one restaurant advertising for another but at the time i didn t know of the connection i love escobar s milo s was just sad
  the lamb meat is very well prepared and taste amazing i had a gyro and it was stuffed full the employees were nice and professional the ambience is calm and relaxing despite being across the street from the airport i would recommend you try arriving before the lunch time rush if you get here after 1130ish you may be waiting awhile
  had an amazing dinner here with friends a few nights ago i had the chicken and waffles and it was one of the best meals i can remember the chicken was great and the waffle complimented it perfectly great meal
  i used to go to brad s quite often when they first opened i really enjoyed their ginsburg salad well after eating about two a week for a few months it was time for me to take a break so i went back today and got my salad first lets start with the fact it s a 7 salad and i could make them for much less but to be realistic i am not going to do that now i do understand that the toppings on this salad are expensive goat cheese walnuts cran raisins red onion but the two leaf s of romaine lettuce not so much when i was handed my salad today i thought they were kidding the container was less than half full and there were no onions or goat cheese to be fair he did realize he forgot the cheese while i was still staring at my salad in disbelief i didn t notice the onions were missing until i had walked back to my building 4 blocks away needless to say i ate my salad and i wish i had skipped the walk to lunch so i could go home an hour early should have just gone to mcdonald s across the hall won t be returning brads sorry
  this place is definitely for locals the people in there were watching football seemed like regulars friendly with the bartenders it s located in a random shopping mart the inside has more of a laid back bar vibe they have a poster that notes that they have the best burgers in phoenix my boyfriend is all about finding the best burger he didn t find it here but i really enjoyed mine a random girl who definitely was a regular came up to us and told us to order the peppercorn burger which my boyfriend ordered i believe i had the blt burger it had this jam like taste which i really liked i m a very simple burger girl like not even cheese but this was different and it was some good stuff really nice customer service the bartender gave us waters right away gave suggestions on the menu and just overall nice i think he could tell we weren t from the area i mean two filipino people in phoenix dressed nice lol i guess we re outta place hahahah they were still welcoming
  what a great place the food is delicious and super healthy i love that they have different options for whatever your diet is they have 3 menus everything vegan and gluten free they also serve wine beer their coffee is really good and i love that they have raw sugar and stevia not a splenda or equal in sight i had the spinach and avocado frittata and instead of the chipotle potato hash i got a side of turkey sausage which was really yummy i did have a bite of the potato hash though and it was really good i also highly recommend the pumpkin pie latte while it s still in season
  if you enjoy low quality food full of gmo this is your restaurant to be fair we dined there several times over the last few years out of desperation good mexican food is lacking in henderson nv the chips taste like they contain a sawdust filler as a binding ingredient until this restaurant we have never experienced dry pico de gallo no lime or lemon unbelievably they always use tomatoes that are near white as the tasteless onion they use unsatisfying tasteless and cheap ingredients there is a reason for the dim lighting in the restaurant and that is because if you could actually see the artificial color in the cheese you might not eat the meal sorry but i can t even call it food there is no pride in food at this establishment it is over rated for excellent mexican food with flavor visit leticia s la comida denudo or mi casa taste the difference for yourself
  this place was very average i ve had much better mexican food and this reminded me a lot of a chipotle but maybe a step below i m not a fan and wont be back there is much better mexican food in arizona
  2nd time here taking dinner home again decent prices and good food terrible dining facility it would be nicer to eat in a school cafeteria it is difficult to understand the girl behind the counter she has a very heavy accent check out then menu online and know what you want before you come in
  we waited and waited and waited to be served it was a nice and warm september day and we were hungry so we waited some more but after almost 20 min unsuccessfully trying to get the attention of the waiter we left probably won t be coming back
  vegas isn t supposed to have pizza like this this place is transplanted from utah and rocked my world the first time i had it unreal settebello simplifies a pizzeria the blending of three things make this pizza what it is the oven i swear it s their oven the cheese only mozzarella the crust is oh so chewy an exact napoli pizza wipes drool off keyboard
  my boyfriend introduced me to this place a little while ago and i have to say that it is awesome it is not expensive and they have something for everyone he is like a sushi connoisseur and loves to eat everything single thing on the menu i on the other hand can only stomach a few pieces of raw fish before i tap out jjanga has an all you can eat option and it doesn t have to apply to everyone at the table which is great because my bf can pig out while i enjoy the few rolls that i love speaking of their rolls they have so many and the ones that i have tasted have been deeeelicious this place is reallyyy good very cool vibe and chill sushi chefs def a must try
  five star rating is for the great food baja fish taco braised beef and carne asada taco all great chips and salsa also fresh and very good service on the other hand was subpar not bad enough to lose me forever since the food was so good i will give them another shot just hope service is better this time update had to bring down to a four after eating at barrio queen new standard
  one of the places i visited when i came to vegas for the weekend the first thing the waitress told us was that they re told that they have the best eggs beni and wow she was not lying i m usually stear away from eggs beni because of the sauce but it just sounded amazing i had to try it i ordered the lobster eggs benedict and i m so glad i did i did not want it to end i ordered a mocha as well which was really good i also went to the little shop next door to get some french macaroons which were a perfect little dessert would definitely go back when i visit vegas again
  almost 4k reviews with an average of 4 stars i was excited to try a few dishes here to say the least we ordered smoke salmon egg benedict blueberry pancakes and cheese omelet everything was ok but not what i was expecting from a 4k reviews 4 stars restaurant i had smoked salmon benedict which was a little too runny for my taste salmon was too little and hollandaise sauce was almost non existent not sure if i ll give it another shot
  my family had sunday brunch at bistro la bon yesterday for the first time our party of 6 was seated immediately we arrived at 11 and the food was excellent what really made this restaurant exceptional was the service we received i mentioned to our server i believe his name was jason that my toddler has food allergies and i didn t plan to give him much from the buffet i didn t think anything of it as this is normal for us but within minutes our server returned and explained all of the items that he verified with the kitchen were safe for my son they also made him sorbet for dessert since none of the sweets were safe for him going the extra mile to accommodate us really made this meal special and we will definitely be back
  been coming to ed s for awhile i ve never been disappointed yet we are greeted as we come in ok we come often but we are not on a first name basis service is friendly yes it s not a fancy dinning area i kinda like the nautical seat covers and it was cool inside on a 110 day the place is clean kitchen is clutter free and you can see them cooking as you wait fish and chips are piping hot and the chips are freshly made not greasy or see thro with grease but perfect the fish is square yes but it s crispy and breaded served hot so that i start with the chips first one day i would love to try the shrimp or something else but i m happy with my order and the cool people who work here btw one of the cooks reminds me of josh harris from deadliest catch just sayin
  amazing flavorful breakfast place food is on point staff is friendly and helpful they are always busy and they keep up it is a small place but worth the wait
  we ordered the jack daniel s burger along with the combo fries the burger was good but the jack daniel s flavoring was a little too sweet and thankfully they put it in a separate container i m not a seet potatoe fries kinda guy but they were ok as well the service was good and the refills on our soft drinks were constant they even offered to make us a drink to go if we wanted to which is kinda cool
  very nice place to experience eastern mediterranean food extensive menu and nice cozy environment unlimited pita bread and complimentary tea was a nice touch the chicken shishkabob was very good nice attentive service will be back for more
  i m only giving this 1 stars because of our excellent server jeremy i ordered the bbq ranch chicken salad it was the worst salad i ever had did not want to complain seeing my friend was buying me lunch the lettuce was soggy to the point that it was mushy and wet looking like a noodle i could hardly find any chicken on it and the taste was very bland and then i heard our server tell the next table that deep dish is chicago style and i grew up in chicago and trust me it is a very thin crust with ingredients covered in cheese and then cut in squares deep dish did not catch on till the 70s so since bj s says its chicago style they could learn a lesson on history of pizza there but all in all i am sooooo disappointed in my salad that i had to stop for a burger a few hours later cause i only ate wilted lettuce for lunch yucky it is making me wonder if i will ever return there again for any meal
  i have never been to this restaurant and decided to purchase a groupon i am so happy i did the pizza was made to order and delicious i opted to go with very generic toppings one had sausage and mushrooms the other had peperoni and mushrooms they were both wonderful great balance of cheese and sauce plenty of toppings i saved half of each for my husband i m sure he ll be very happy when he eats them had i been able to eat the whole pie i would have unfortunately i could only eat 4 slices so i get to eat the rest tomorrow and my lucky husband gets to have the other pie and taste both i split them i will definately be back groupon or not give it a try it was great
  this place sucks donuts are stale and overpriced front counter person is rude and the prices seem to be a bit flexible there is also fake reviews for them on yelp count your change
  i went back a second time and they have changed the way they make the wellington it now only comes one way you cannot order it medium well or any other way just thought it was funny after my initial review still very good though
  i have some friends that live in the phoenix area that i visit every year they brought this for take out and personally i think it s the best pizza i realize everyone has their own tastes but for me this does it great taste thick pieces fantastic
  absolutely the worst hot dog on fremont street you can go to multiple places and get a better dog for less money everyone in our group was totally disappointed
  closed on a sunday because it s memorial day weekend this is why local businesses fail sheer laziness thankfully mcdonalds knows their butts from a hole in the ground are open
  one memorable dish is not enough for a michelin star michael mina is located in the bellagio its interior has a cool modern feel we went with the tasting menu accompanied with the premium wine pairing some of the signature dishes were a bit disappointing the lobster pot pie did not live up to its hype one dish that did blow me away was their tuna tartare that was mixed table side the fish was of an amazing quality and after being carefully mixed with sesame oil garlic mint and pine nuts it amplified all the goodness service was perfect and the entire meal was good but for the price there are too many other top restaurants in vegas i would frequent before mm
  it s a small little place hidden in the corner with a few other stores buy the circle k they have good specials on the pizza so you can t really complain on that they add the toppings you want throw it back in the oven and let it cook pizza is pretty good you get some big slices the special is for 2 but i m sure 1 slice would fill up most people it is kind of greasy though so that kind of kills it a bit but the flavor is pretty good the staff is friendly and easy going and just fun to carry on a conversation with as you wait for the pizza all in all it s not top of the line pizza but def not the worst so if you re need in something to eat i d recommend you stop
  21 different burgers with a variety of protein choices fries and milk shakes what could go wrong on my first trip not much i had the bacon cheesy burger and fries my daughter had the grilled cheese off the kids menu which used slider buns for the bread and it was delicious there are a number of dipping sauces to choose from for the fries or to add to your burger next time i ll get the sweet potato fries so i can try the toasted marshmallow sauce with them the kids lived their shakes too service was quick of course with all these fast casual places where you order at the counter and pay get your own drink etc what the heck do you tip
  excellent food for a weekday lunch the prices hovered around 11 for meal and drink but the slight bump in price was well worth it excellent chicken in both dishes that my husband and i tried plenty of fresh ingredients and creative combinations the sauce variety was fun and delicious and the unique drinks and deserts were all tempting seating is limited during peak lunch hours but the crowd seemed to move pretty quickly we found abundant street parking a block or so from the restaurant and the police were definitely checking the parking meters
  i went to top golf convinced i was not going to enjoy myself i do not care for golf not even mini golf but my work was going for team building and i showed up the cost isn t bad 35 for a bay and 5 dollars a person for a card i personally didn t golf but the rest of my team did they all raved about the different games you could play with the micro chipped balls the food was wonderful the drinks were plentiful originally we were in a bay where the fan was broken so they moved us and it was much cooler the only gripe is a coworker of mine ordered a burger and asked for guac the food runner was convinced the order was not right though it looked right because of the guac and the poor girl had to wait an extra 20 minutes while they found her food they insist this made a new once since they lost it but she was convinced they brought her the original one food runners can be a necessity but make sure they know people can custom order extra toppings
  i ve been to countless pubs and they must all order their food from the same food source always edible never outstanding for the most part we were walking around old montreal and wanted a quick bite since we had a 10 30pm reservations at au pied de cochon the keg is standard pub fare we went with buffalo wings in a teriyaki sauce and keg sliders mystery meat school cafeteria beef the bartenders were friendly but i felt like we stopped at a gas station to refuel and then we were gone
  best all egg white omelette they had the best all egg white omelette i ve ever had ordered it for lunch mushroom spinach onion swiss cheese also ordered tomato slices as side with bagel and cream cheese returned to this place for dinner the same day and ordered the veggie as a meal with 4 veggies but didn t know it came with a bowl of rice in addition to 4 veggie choices if i knew i wouldn t have ordered a starch as a veggie mushrooms chili cornbread starch spinach broccoli and bowl of rice the chili cornbread was a bit heavy with butter oil but was flavorful i then returned again the following morning to order the same awesome omelette but it wasn t as good the second omlette was not as fluffy not as flavorful less buttery flavor there was too much spinach and not enough mushrooms but it was still a very good omelette this was my favorite place to eat on this trip
  delicious some of the best hanger steak and pommes frites some of the best desserts around with the beignents and creme brulee the one thing i don t like is the truffled ice cream that was a bit much even for me barring that everything else was delicious and not a bad price point
  the buffalo wild wings that made me a fan great location great size and great service
  i joined my gal pal chrissy p for a drink at the lounge last night and i was pleasantly surprised like she said it is definitely the sidebar of sunnyslope we had great friendly attentive service from chris and he wasn t rough on the eyes ladies and he was pretty knowledgeable about the drinks i opted for a red wine flight and was pleased with the selection there were two cabs two zins a red a pinot noir a merlot two malbecs and another choice or two mostly from california the flight was 9 they had a ton of variety of chairs and areas to sit which was really awesome you could sit on the high tops share a table for four in big white contemporary chairs grab a normal table by the window or opt for these really huge oversize comfy purple chairs which we did mellow lounge music played over the speakers and there were several tv s with relevant sports on the magic 8 balls were a cool touch the place has a really good vibe i dig it the food selection was made of appetizers but unfortunately as a gluten free vegan all i could eat were the freshly made potato chips by unfortunately i mean thank god because they were delicious overall i am really jazzed about this place a quick five minutes away from my house this is the perfect way to wind down from a stressful day i hope they adopt a happy hour and add some more vegan items to the menu and i will become a regular
  this place is always dependable the food is always good the service is always a little lackluster but without blame as those guys and gals bust their backends considering how busy the place is always and the prices are really fair especially considering portion sizes and happy hour specials it s a no frills experience you go you wait but you wait because the food is good and fresh and doesn t leave you hungry in an hour like many other chinese restaurants
  i haven t been here for a few years and the last time i remember thinking eh it is okay my sentiment remains the same everything is just fine the food is okay somewhat overpriced but being on the strip i guess i can understand that we got the spicy shrimp roll the tempura calimari the peppers and the chicken teriaki noodles the sauce for the peppers was really good just a little too salty and everything else was pretty average my main complaint was the service slow and lackluster from the moment we walked in we waited quite awhile to be seated and our server forgot to bring us things we d requested many times from a fork to drinks we d ordered i d only return if someone else really wanted to go or if i just was starving for sushi at fashion show mall
  i love buffetsssss and the bellagio buffet is one of the best in vegas first off the line can take an hour but it is totally worth it second i ate so much seabass it was ridiculous their seabass is soooo delicious and buttery and flakey and all the good stuff definitely worth the 30 dollars i spent we went on a monday night the crab legs were a little salty and not as good as i thought they would be mushroom raviolis were also really good definitely though the sea bass is to die for
  off the hook great bar but it s more than just a bar it s a playground for adults sand volleyball cornhole horse shoes and things for youngsters to climb an play on too during the day the manager was awesome one of are drinks got forgot and she got us a round of drinks real attractive servers great atmosphere and a great time my all time go to place for a good night out with fun loving people the band was good too thanks for all the fun
  sushi people my second luv after pizza now this place is alright with me its in a minnie strip mall very unassuming however there sushi is very well prepared and the flavors are excellent they have funny name for there rolls for example my favorite is i love my ass its topped with super white tuna and filled with an excellent japanese salsa yum if your in the area and want sushi this place will satisfy your sushi hunger it s also normally priced none all u can eat sushi place definitely two thumbs up for food service was a little suspect but i mainly am a food jugde people happy eats my yelpers
  i can t believe the less than great reviews for pamela s i also can t believe that i ve never reviewed this place before despite it being right around the corner from me well i woke up yesterday with an appetite for a really good breakfast so borrowing an idea from a really good friend of mine i decided to take my guy out to eat well he must have really had a great appetite himself because he ordered the bannana walnut pancakes carbs calories fat mmmm just thinking about that pump that insulin susan pump well i am a type 1 diabetic and even though i opted for the slightly less carb a lish ous pancakes and an egg on the side i still was pumping that insulin cos their cakes are s o o o o good the menu even bills them as the devil s carb corner hey a girl can t eat just scrambled eggs all her life a couple of things though pamela s does have a lunch menu but they don t serve these on sunday also the place is cash only so be sure to stop at the atm beforehand
  sushi rocks here order the yellowtail jalapeo restaurant design is exceptional love the newspaper stacked against the wall
  honestly i ve had better mexican food but the outside patio and dining room is so beautifully decorated i always make sure to bring out of state guests here the waitstaff has always been friendly and the food is served quick and piping hot the wait for a table during snow bird season can be awfully long so be prepared
  get your toasted sub here instead of dealing with the potheads at the cheba they taste better and there is actually room to sit
  my friends and i decided to come here for dinner i ordered the meatless veggie hoagie which contained grilled spinach tomatoes cheese fried onions and mushrooms i noticed that the chips tasted homemade which were quite tasty and crunchy fresh my friends had meat items so i didn t get to try their dishes they did say that they enjoyed their meal so no complaints there our server was very attentive and kept our glasses full and the entertainer was fabulous there was an older gentleman that played the accordion the entire time we were there my friends paid for everything which i am grateful for so i didn t even see the bill isn t that sweet so i can t comment on how much it cost
  i used to be a regular customer at landmark when i lived in charlotte so when i visited this past week this was my first stop i was so disappointed as soon as you walk in you an tell that the atmosphere has changed the staff is not as friendly we ordered sodas i had to send mine back twice because they were flat our orders came with bread and salads we never received them two of us ordered the italian trio it was awful it was cold and tasteless when i mentioned it to the manager i was told that they cant season the food because they have elderly customers i guess the other customers don t count i m not sure if they re under new management but this restaurant has really gone down and i think they need to stop using the diners drive ins and dives thing to get customers that was way back when they were good
  i was in lawrenceville and was looking at local eats and came across del s i was further intrigued by seeing that it had been on restaurant impossible so we headed over for lunch the decor is nice with a big mural on the outside and a couple off street parking spots we walked in past the decently big bar toward the first dining room looked nice and trendy i ordered the california chicken salad with avocado crusted chicken my fiance ordered the sausage and pepperoni panini we both got waters and were offered lemon which was a nice touch we got some soft italian bread that was unfortunately served cold but it was tasty and soft while we were waiting for our entrees our server asked us if we wanted more and we did we got individual butter pats with our bread our food came out and my salad looked beautiful in almost a cobb salad display the tomatos were coated in some sort of oil and they were not my favorite part of the salad the bacon was really crisp and tasty and there was plenty of food to go around my fiance s panini was a gigantic portion but he said it tasted like a mediocre pizza since it was too big to close and eat as a sandwich he was only able to eat half and we took the other half home the fries were more like potato wedges and these were very good they brought us out an extra side of dressing and ketchup to dip the fries in promptly our server was very good and refilled our waters in a sufficient amount of time overall i would give this place a b but would probably come back here to try some more of the italian specialties
  been coming here about every year since 2006 as a way to escape the tourists and enjoy some dining with the locals this place never disapponts different server every time and they ve all been excellent very friendly professional and attentive the food is great as well love the deserts on hot days or nights sit outside and and they ll have the misters going so you re not uncomfortable i honestly forget i m in a chain restaurant when i m in here it s that good will never miss when i m in town
  we came in here for a couple of drinks after a monday night football game for a monday night it was really dead i don t think this place is used to seeing so many asian people in their bar we were even carded twice they ve got some beer pong tables out front and the bar tender seemed pretty friendly all the tables and chairs are really high i m not really quite sure why that is so for a short person like me it was easier for me to just stand and talk to people the prices for drinks are reasonable anywhere from 5 to 8 or so i found the place kind of boring though
  try this place if you like hot pot and you re near vegas it s a drive away from the strip but worth the time and a better value than the big hotel buffets we ate here twice this week ayce lobster oysters crab shrimp clams wontons papaya salad everything the tom yum soup was very tasty we ll definitely be back next time we visit vegas
  large portions not huge which is good portugese sausage hash browns and eggs was what i ordered it also came with a small stack of buttermilk pancakes hashbrowns were good crispy on the outside and cooked through yolks were nice and runny portugese sausage was meh not purity so oh well pancakes had good flavor but were a bit gummy not light and fluffy gravy from the chicken fried steak could have stood a little more cook time as it still had that flour taste the steak part though had nice flavor and was tender the red velvet pancakes which i tried was meh if they improved the texture of their pancakes it would be a really winner we ll see
  oh chipotle so delicious yet so punishing later i m all for giant burritos but damn chicken is win also how come guacamole is extra are avocados really that expensive i didn t think so last time i bought some and didn t i just pay like 9 for a burrito and drink meh
  awesome place i recommend this place to bring on a date or with family and friends excellent service and our server kristin was amazing she was very attentive and genuine
  great food went with a group of people and we had the chicken parm deep dish pizza and shrimp scampi kearnen our server was great
  i know they re known for their fries which are very satisfying with the array of seasonings to choose from but i really enjoyed their chicken tenders overall it s a good spot in town square if you re looking for alternative options from all the restaurants nearby however be mindful of the wait it s a quick bite joint but not so quick
  i ve been to this flemings many times over the years and it s always outstanding we reserved a table late and let them know it was my girlfriends birthday and sure enough best booth in the house first of all our server kevin was hospitable and went above and beyond the call of duty typically then service here is good but tonight was excellent steaks my favorite food and the dry aged ribeye here is bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection i started with the french onion because i ve been getting in the gym recently and had minimal guilt the lava cake was a bridge too far but it was her birthday really delicious flemings potatoes are usually a must and the creamed corn had a nice zip to it always a great wine selection here and always on my list of when are we going to
  first comment is we went in for a late dinner stayed beyond their closing time never a push a rush to leave i really do not have one complaint the food was stellar the fish was excellent flaky delicious wine the waiter suggested was excellent everything was wonderful lastly i will comment about the staff everyone we met or encountered was pleasant
  i don t watch tv and the only food i can make comes out of a toaster i had no idea the giada in the name of this place referred to a renowned woman with many culinary and cultural accolades i genuinely found out who she was about 45 minutes after arriving at the cromwell for our 7 15 reservations which is even more amazing depressing when you stop and realize i was the one who booked the reservation for our meal last friday night nonetheless for a guy on the outside of pop culture cooking looking in giada managed to impress me from presentation to service while the food definitely delivered on the reputation this gal has made for herself giada sits at the top of a couple escalators or at the end of a very lengthy white hallway if you take the elevator in the cromwell i actually suggest taking the elevator because i imagine making that extended walk is how football players feel on their way to the field or how surgeons get heading for the operating room lives are about to be changed through that hallway and facebook photos will undoubtedly be posted once you get to the entrance it s a surprisingly small waiting room to the left of a hostess desk flanked by a duo of dashing young ladies that have style to burn you can rest on a couple of sofa cushions head to the right where the bar and bathrooms are or you could stop in the photobooth near the sofas to kill time and post a few wacky pictures to facebook bonus points are awarded not really if you are wearing a shirt that makes you blend in with the wallpaper in this booth like i did without my maroon sweater vest i think i would have looked like a disembodied floating head against that background we were slightly early for our reservation but in no time at all a hostess escorted us still ahead of our time score to our table in the window overlooking the strip the dining room is kind of tiered with the bar at the top and the dining rooms unfolding outward blending in chairs and horseshoe style booths now is a good time to mention that the view here cannot be beat if you re in the window seats major brownie points can only be won with your date when the bellagio s water show kicks into action across the street and you re on your third bottle of wine our server along with all the food runners and bussing staff were attentive without being overwhelming following our technological snafu with the interactive drink menu read an ipad our server got us started with orzo meatballs a margherita flatbread a beet and apple salad and a couple rounds of this awesome bread combo i never got to try the flatbread the four pieces in it were scarfed down quickly but those meatballs made me question how i ve gone this long in life without eating them kind of like how i managed to live all these years without tasting lobster ravioli like the kind from here that ravioli was heavenly and everyone else expressed similar sentiments for their tortellini and pappardelle dishes before dessert could arrive and threaten to end my life right there via caloric overload i escaped to the bathroom this has nothing to do with anything but aside from being spotless these were also the best smelling bathrooms i ve ever been in i m tempted to start doing my laundry in one of the stalls if i could figure out how to get there on a regular basis from dallas with eyes bigger than our stomachs we opted for a selection of giada s favorite cookies i can safely say this woman knows fine taste chocolate chip was what you d expect the peanut butter and jelly were a pleasant surprise but the lemon ricotta cookies i m not a dessert person but i think i actually wept while eating those tears of happiness and savoriness mind you if there are any nitpicks to make they are minor management was scattered about and did not seem to put too much worth on the customer experience i think i saw a manager talk to two maybe three tables that s unfortunate for a spot like this as i would like to see the higher ups at the least asking how everything is and possibly even displaying a personality and or a pulse i also don t know what to think about the special dinner that comes with an autographed picture of giada herself it s a cute promotion but if giada or her pr people are reading this this place is better than that kind of gimmick again totally minor practically inconsequential critiques to be made sure the price can be steep if you do not do your homework but look at the complete package friendly servers and hostesses a priceless view and a menu that made a believer out of a guy who had no idea who the woman behind everything was that last part alone should be enough to get your foot in the door if you are even slightly considering this destination on your next vegas trip
  great wings i ve loved all that i ve tried however it does seem overpriced and at this particular location they are terrible at customer service the huge long waits don t help matters either
  they have delicious rolls with excellent fish quality unfortunately they reduced the size of their rolls and still charge the same prices we tried the corn tempura appetizer which was a tempura patty with fresh sweet corn inside it was a challenge to eat with chopsticks so we just broke it off with our hands our favorite rolls are the roppongi and the japanese lasagna we had the gt r roll too which was good but it just didn t compare to the flavor that the roppongi had
  3 95 steak n eggs that should of got your attention no player card needed available from midnight to 6 am they also have other good choices off their graveyard menu i love this place because unlike some other places you don t get to breathe in cancer causing smoke while you are eating the ventilation is really good here service is above average the only thing you gotta worry about is sometimes there is a long line just right before midnight just so everybody can get those graveyard specials so if you are already starving you will probably get all cranky waiting to sit down and order you might wann pack a snickers cuz just like the commercial you re not you when you re really hungry
  thanks to my friend and fellow yelper sherry y for the great recommendation fiamma trattoria bar is one of those restaurants that could easily be lost in the shuffle of many great vegas establishments yet this little restaurant that is tucked away behind the casino of mgm grand can offer rich flavors like no other for appetizers we order the beef carpaccio it came with thinly sliced beef tenderloin topped with arugula mushroom and permesan cheese the popular lobster gnocchi came with classic italian gnocchi that is just the right texture not too soft or too chewy the lobster meat tasted fresh and cooked perfectly this dish definitely packs a punch of rich flavors although it might get a little overwhelming at the end i also tried the braised short rib it was very tender and again very rich in flavor the rib was placed on top of mashed potato so the flavor of the rib actually got into the mashed potato which i like all in all a very good and hearty meal which could be hard to find on the strip i can t wait to go again
  i was super excited when i heard a new thai spot had opened up in henderson after reading shirley b s review on yelp i knew we had to try this place they have an excellently priced lunch menu and if you pay cash you get 10 off i always love a good deal gata is a small sit down spot the waitress is super friendly and on point we both ordered off the lunch menu i got the red beef curry and joel ordered the pork chow mein the soup that came with the meal was a little salty but i liked the seaweed and little bits of tofu our food came out quickly and hot the red beef curry came in it s own bowl with a side of rice and a small salad the salad dressing had a sweet lemon vinaigrette which was a bit to sweet for my liking the curry had a great spice it could have been spicier but i really loved the overall flavor the meat was tender and i was happy to discover they put lots of bamboo shoots in the dish joel devoured his pork chow mein it had crisp veggies and lots of meat it too had good flavor i really enjoyed gata thai i ve been thinking about their red curry since we went plus i m currently on liquids for a while and i look forward to trying their soups another tasty spot has come to henderson
  if you re a beer lover in montreal it can be difficult to expand the bar circuit beyond dieu du ciel and the lesser competitors such as benelux bdm and such between the great beer selection and the way above average bar food it was well worth the detour pros very fair prices especially on food the pulled pork poutine as well as the sausage plate are damn good 30 quebec beers on tap nice cons out of the way mediocre to average service uninspiring indoor ambiance will def go back
  excellent authentic and so delicious and vegetarian friendly too the ambience is awesome its a great place sit outside on the patio although the place is really crowded the service is excellent the food arrives in time and the waiters are really really friendly and accommodating try the veggie pizza with the peppers on it that was our personal fav we ended up ordering another one if you re in the mood for real authentic pizza the type that doesn t make you feel bad when you re done go for it
  not so good they seated us at a small table in the middle of the room and right next to a restroom with a noisy swinging slamming door service wasn t so great neither was food 3 stars for a cool name and fishing pier decorations
  absolutly love the theme of this restaurant allows you to create and build your personal pizza to your liking staff all smiled friendly and energetic order was ready in less than 5 minutes pizza was soft hot and so delicious great location right near unlv recommend it to anyone looking to get creative with their food definitely new favorite pizza spot
  thank goodness we made reservations the place is small and crowded and obviously very popular i recommend making reservations you won t be disappointed i had the bulgogi which was really tasty but a little chewy and had too much gristle for my taste other than that the sushi was so yummy the vegetable salad and its dressing was awesome miso soup really good vegetable tempura and its sauce heavenly for dessert we shared a plate of mochi ice cream our waiter allowed us to choose 2 different flavors so we chose green tea and mango both very good and refreshing talking about refreshing after the miso soup we were given a slice of sweet orange and that not only cleansed the palate but it was cool and refreshing nice touch oh and one more thing their prices are reasonable and affordable and they make it easy to come back often because eating there doesn t put a big ouch on your pocketbook bravo to its owner
  the food is amazing you can basically create your own dish you pick a basic pasta and you can add any extra garnishes and side dishes that your heart desires the prices aren t too steep so you don t have to worry about breaking the bank they ve also recently added cupcakes from the cupcakery to their menu it s a great addition to an already outstanding repertoire
  service just ok a little slow it was a friday night around 6 pm atmosphere good the decor is nice and it feels just a little upscale though you don t need to dress up food just ok the noodles are from a box which is a little disappointing if you re expecting authentic italian food you won t find it here we had the rosa pasta with prosciutto and mushrooms the flavor was excellent but i found it a little salty we also had the margarita pizza which was just ok the crust was nice and thin but the flavor was a little dull price point i found this place a little expensive for what you get wine was very expensive and you get probably 1 4 of a glass for 9 14 per glass or around 40 and over for a bottle overall it was just ok
  i am a cheesecake factory fan so this is easy for me this one is in the back of the mall forum shops at cesar s palace i just discovered the buffalo blasts appetizer you must try these yummy solid service and a very consistent menu thanks cf
  when i was growing up in the 1970 s britain probably had the worst reputation on earth for their food rife were the jokes about brits and how they would boil toast and that the only decent thing you could ever eat in london was fish chips well thank god some things have changed for the better and some things have stayed the same london is now one of the foodie capitals of the world but the english tradition of great fish chips with a few small changes and updates continues here i guess it shows what a total opposite of a scenester hipster i am since this was my first visit i ve heard tons about this place the past 2 years and i came in with so so expectations there are several versions of fish chips here differing either in the type of fish or the type of batter they use i went with the sole with sour cream and onion batter it was great and so was the fact that even though everything is deep fried in oil nothing came off as greasy or swimming in pools of oil it was almost light i saw a few other interesting items on the menu which i was too full to try but i intend to come back and at least try their scotch egg as well as their deep fried anything dessert prices are really decent and the service is friendly as well bonus if you love cadbury flake chocolates like i do and make a point of buying them in bulk everytime you fly through london heathrow they serve cadbury flake chocolate bar with ice cream here as well
  the description says this restaurant has waiter service i beg to differ that s all i have to say about this one
  it was our first time here today i liked how you can see how they make your pizza i was not feeling creative with my pizza today so we opted for their specialty pizzas to skip the build you own pizza process we got a bianco pizza and a smoked salmon pizza they ran out of white pizza sauce so they had to make other people s pizzas before ours it s a lazy sunday so it was not a big deal we got our fresh and hot pizza rather quickly the smoked salmon pizza has smoked salmon capers red onions olive oil and goat cheese it was like lox and bagels in pizza form it was good the tanginess of the goat cheese balances the saltiness of the smoked salmon the bianco pizza was good too it has gorgonzola pesto white onions mozzarella arugula and truffle oil i just think it would be better if it had pine nuts to give it texture and additional flavor i like their crust it was crisp and was not boring at all we got a free cannoli with our yelp check in it was good actually better since it was free
  not sure why this dq is getting such bad reviews i ve never had a problem when coming here although i ve only ordered ice cream and desserts and have yet to order actual food here there s never a line crowd when i come here and i always get my order quickly the ice cream is so creamy and delicious and my go to is a medium vanilla cone which is huge
  food was very good can t stop saying good things about their service one of the best in a while props again to our server ryan
  standard italian fare and not unreasonable prices we made a reservation for 7pm on a tuesday but walked right up and could have gotten a table without one penne ala vodka was good and our server was friendly great atmosphere would definitely recommend for those looking for an affordable quick no fuss meal
  i really like this place i ve been 5 or 6 times and have brought fairly large parties with me every time the music is good the atmosphere is good burritos are good the chips are less than medium the drinks and churros are really awesome but i just keep getting served by the meanest waitress in the industry i politely told her that she charged us twice for a single pbr she hates to hear this she ripped the bills out of our hands threw them down on the table next to us and yelled at us there was a clear and definite raising of the voice that she slipped the whole bill in with one person s individual bill as well this lady really needs to lose the tude but the joke s on me because i ll be back i guess i don t care if you yell at me just as long as you keep feeding me churros and whiskey drinks
  i give this place 5 stars for being exactly what it markets itself to be decent sushi attentive service great prices there is some happy hour special at all times of the day always consistent in quality never fishy etc servers are friendly helpful easy to understand and they play remixed trendy music creating perfect atmosphere good green tea moochi dessert i have been plenty of times and will continue to frequent this place only suggestion is offer free wifi i would sit and work and eat more sushi if i could get wifi on my laptop tuna sashimi is always perfectly seasons and fresh definite recommendation
  great food service solid had green curry with chicken for lunch food came quickly and got me out in a hurry had limited time only reason for a 4 rating i got some pushback from server when i ordered curry with heat level of 10 scale of 1 10 she said it would be too hot for me curry was nice and spicy but have certainly have had hotter
  this is on my top 5 bbq joints in charlotte i like the rubs and sauce they provide i haven t tried everything on the menu but enough to fall in love with it pulled pork sandwich with slaw is my fav so far parking can be a hassle but thats plaza midwood for yah
  sorry have to bring down the review a star because i came here again 2 weeks later with 9 girls and the service was terrible again our water glasses were always empty and the waiter barely ever came by the worst part was that the crab and asparagus pizza came out as a tasteless piece of bread with condiments on top of that the pizza came out with crab tomatoes and asparagus with no pizza sauce dal toro needs to work on their food and service if they want to charge the prices that they do
  i take away a star for each major complaint the pizza was too salty but still edible flying insects bothered me the whole time and a can of soda is 2 not refills at a fountain one can the complimentary water is cold and refreshing though comes plentiful in a cold blue bottle
  we were very impressed with the array of different food available at this buffet pro s 1 prime rib 2 lamb chops ask for mint jelly 3 sushi 4 dessert bar 5 fried chicken in a basket w sweet potato fries 6 crab legs they were cut open easy to eat con s 1 pork ribs were so salty they affected my taste on other items 2 signage on how to get to buffet we had a hard time finding it most casinos have better signage overall a very good buffet
  let me start by saying i love pizza m it started at a local bakery and grew into its own brick and mortar location my friends and i frequent this place throughout the week wednesday s are great for trivia with abbi and the pizza is an amazing complement i would recommend the abbi a divine concoction topped with a fried egg the sugar bear sausage and maple syrups or the deluxe sharing a location the flying machine cafe is also great they make a wonderful chai tea and mocha and have a great assortment of vintage sodas wines and beer you cannot go wrong
  i really miss this place i had hoped that reading reviews of it on yelp would allow me to experience again if only in my mind how delicious this bad for you food is it s worth the hype haven t found anything like it anywhere since
  what can i say this place is a scottsdale staple 20 years and still going strong i do miss their old menu circa 1990 1995 but they have enough decently priced and varied menu selections to satisfy everyone this is a see and be seen place with an always fun and eclectic crowd old young gays straights dressed up dressed down with a dj spinning some sweet house music on the right nights the drinks may seem pricey however they certainly don t skimp on the liquor and if you re a lightweight you ll be flat on your ass after your second cocktail waitstaff can be hit or miss
  very good food and generous portion will come back again the young lady who helped me with the order was super friendly and they gave me 6 pita bread for togo which is very generous
  when my boyfriend and i arrived to this cute little bistro there were only 1 or 2 tables occupied the walls of the interior are painted a light green color that i enjoyed there are gold statuettes along the walls as well as many large windows that fill the space with natural light on most if not all of the tables are little vases with orchids it was a pleasant dining area even with the tv playing in the background it can be hard to spot if you don t pull into the parking area behind aloha kitchen the menu is displayed on the wall along with several photos of their specialties j quickly decided on the lechon kawali a large portion of crispy skinned pork with juicy fatty meat on the inside it came with a vinegary dipping sauce that complimented the richness of the meat and several slices of raw sweet onion it was really crisp crackled when you bite into kind of crisp i found it made my jaw muscles tired after eating 3 4 pieces but probably not a bad thing since all that chewing might help work off some of that delicious pork fat i ordered the adobo which was a large bowl full of super tender soy and vinegar spiced pork chunks the cuts of pork reminded me of some of the better carnitas i ve had with enough gristle and unrendered fat left to give it an unctuous mouth feel the flavorful sauce was great to pour over the perfectly cooked sticky rice and more of it would ve disappeared easily it seemed like a dish that had been cooking low and slow for quite some time a signature of many comforting dishes i would have liked some vegetables with it to break up all the meatiness but it was a delicious dish the texture of the rice was great with the pork we also got an order of the shanghai lumpia which would have all vanished if i hadn t caught j before he got to them all crisp narrow cigar shaped little pockets of deep fried meaty goodness served with a sweet and sour chili sauce it s easy to see why we also had an ilikoi passion drink and kona coffee the coffee was lovely but was served with packets of non dairy creamer which saddens me a little it s really a small detail but when having such a nice variety of coffee i want to enjoy it fully and without high fructose hydrogenated processed things not a huge deal because it still tasted great but something i find worth pointing out i was really excited that they offered kona coffee the passion fruit drink was also tasty though j drank most of it the water tasted like tap water so we barely sipped any overall the food here was great if you re a fan of the hawaiian sun drinks i imagine you ll be happy it s a nice change of pace from the usual strip mall fare and i d rather go here than to another mcchipotle or pei wei not my usual neighborhood hang out but i can see going back sooner rather than later
  on our first visit we tried the different tapas on their happy hour menu and were not really impressed we came back last sunday since i was craving for paellla and it was a wonderful surprise that the food quality was totally different we ordered paella camarones al ajillo and brochettas de pollo and they were all good the camarones al ajillo i say is a must try my bf almost licked the plate we will be back
  great food steak was perfectly done and awesome service i will be coming back for sure
  i really enjoyed having breakfast here today the food was good and the service excellent the place is now under a new owner and has been completely remodeled and decorated to give a retro atmosphere they have pictures on the walls of marylin monroe the rat pack that s dean martin sammy davis jr and frank sinatra the beetles etc they have done a very good job of fixing the place up and i look forward to trying lunch there next the restaurant opens at 5am and closes at 3 during the week and opens at 7am on saturday closed sunday
  i never thought i d be singing the praises of filet mignon sushi but here i am i ve been to this place several times but after the last trip i had to come tell you all how great it is my gf and i were headed to naked fish the other night not because it s our favorite but because it s where we had our first date so we like to go back once in a while we arrived to find an hour wait which meant goodbye naked fish hello sen of japan we sat at the bar for the first time and i must tell you unless you re with a large group this is the best way to go the chefs are so attentive and friendly it made for a much better experience i started with the miso shittake soup while the gf had the agedashi with japanese eggplant both were nice twists on old favorites the spider roll done caterpillar style with avocado and sweet chili sause was so good we had to get another i ve had a lot of sushi in my life but the tuna i had there that night was simply the best piece of fish i ve ever tasted bottom line if you re looking to pig out go somewhere else to an all you can eat if you want a wide variety of good food and great service come here
  good menu good food good service what more can you ask
  i m the pickiest person when it comes to thai because of a place back home i loved the coconut curry chicken is the best e1 on the menu add a little pineapple and cashews the sweet and the spice is perfect
  my five year old loves ethiopian food so it s a common choice in our family for eating out she particularly loves the traditional weaved tables and stools so we started off usually going abay around the corner from tana because of these tables right in front but after three disappointing meals at abay in a row we made an executive decision to eat at tana instead that was a good choice the food is delicious nothing over spiced or overly oiled tender meats flavorful vegetables it s also nice to get a beer with the meal i ve been a fan of the hakim stout lately then there s the owner a friendly and enthusiastic man who delights in bringing our little girl extra dishes to try lamb and a few cookies after the meal other servers we ve had there while less effusive have been nothing but friendly and helpful tana suffers from a poor location and so is often sparsely populated that is a shame it s a great place if you find yourself waiting for a table at the ever crowded abay or better yet before you even go head to tana you will not be disappointed
  i like to consider myself a food connoisseur of sorts i love food i also love vegas i stumbled and yes i mean stumbled literally on earls early one morning i said sure ill eat that i thought wow this is pretty good woke up the next morning and told my buddy that i had the best sandwich ive ever had last night he was like sure drunk food is always good we tried it again and yes it is the best sandwich i have ever had the original is my absolute favorite roast beef cheese and some horseradish sauce delish i look forward going back to vegas specifically to go to earls they do not have one in phoenix and this is the closest one to where i live i have taken several people and they all agree its awesome did i mention sandwiches are all about the bread and this place had nailed it
  this is a great place for locals to go for happy hour food is great and you cant beat 5 dollar pitchers on happy hour still have figured out the trivia night schedule but its a nice surprise when i walk in to join the game staff is friendly even with a laid back vibe they still make sure everyone is taken care of this is my go to place now that i live in the area
  nice mom and pops restaurant the food is very tasty portions are good very very nice people they gave a compliment japchae dish
  this is obviously a well run and managed establishment we were well taken care of and the whole team works together to serve at a superior level the food was also incredible i enjoyed the short ribs which were tender delicious and perfectly cooked the horseradish mashed potatoes were amazing but if you don t like a little kick you ve been warned my wife enjoyed the trout and said it was a great combination of textures and flavors as a final not i would highly recommend the signature huckleberry marguerita all and all you get much more than you pay for at the roaring fork
  had lunch their today and i agree with a previous reviewer it was ok not bad so so i ll try another mexican restaurant next time in casa grande
  in a land of aspiring craft brewers mcfate has the recipe to success down pat i was so happy that a second location opened up this location has a more comprehensive menu than fate north on shea i ve had almost every beer on the menu and they are all fantastic my favorites include the shift pint candy bar stout double oatmeal ipa and fatality it does rotate so your options can change daily the food is fantastic i often order the pablo honey with no meat i crave this pizza after a long road trip my boyfriend and i find ourselves grabbing one to go on our way home there s nothing like it anywhere another item i ve chosen was the fish sandwich it s perfect two fish sticks on a light bun it s not as greasy as most fish sandwiches totally hits the spot their sides include cottage cheese personal favorite i was excited to see this sweet potato fries addicting tater tots yes please a side salad it s quite large for a side and regular julienned style fries they have a veggie burger and gluten free options for those with dietary restrictions don t forget to try the desserts i hope they cater weddings because their desserts are one of a kind the service is excellent the manager brandon always greets us as if we lived there which we kind of do but that s a story for another time he s great he knows his beer definitely a place to catch the game and enjoy quality food i love fate
  loved the place the food and the service heat lovers do try their edamame everything was a pleasant surprise and i love surprises like these have recommended this place to so many
  this place isn t called grange takeaway for nothing so no complaints about the lack of seating this is a nice wee sandwich breakfast hot drinks takeaway joint perfect for grabbing a quick big bite these are all made using fresh ingredients this is no baguette express they do also nice soup usually a choice of two and often both vegetarian also note that they offer free tea and coffee with breakfast orders before 11 30
  well priced good breakfast from the outside it looks run down but inside was very clean and nice i felt very comfortable and food was good i look forward to going back for lunch
  this place was amazing super healthy and everything tasted great the location is a little bit off the beating path but worth it the fresh fruit juice smoothies are off the hook
  the crust on the pies is wonderful had a more traditional choice pepperoni and artichoke and a new combo the buffalo wing both were wonderful the caesar salad was fine nothing to faint about and the brushetta was nice the beer selection is a bit lame but i ll survive my only complaint would be that the two times we ve been here the food shows up too quickly needs to be timed out better so we don t feel rushed glad we have yet another interesting place in the hood to add to our list of go to places
  i will give it a 2 for the horrible service i had at the bar the bar guy didn t know s___ about beer or wine it took him about 5 minutes to even say hi i asked for menus and he gave me the drink menu after 5 mins he asked what i wanted then i asked for the food menu another 2 mins then another 10 mins till he asked me about the food there were only 4 people at the bar an about 15 in the restaurant food i really liked the food and think the 9 app happy hour is well worth it try the hot stones
  not sure how to structure this review because i have a lot to say so bear with me how about getting to the point first ambiance 2 stars food 3 5 stars service 10 stars value 10 stars total 3 5 stars rounded up i took my wife here the saturday before valentine s day since alas i travel for business and wasn t going to be around for v day itself upon walking in my wife remarked that it smelled like her grandparents house you mean like chicken soup and death i had the same reaction it made sense the next youngest patron there was a good 40 or 50 years our senior you could smell the formaldehyde now to a word of warning this place is not romantic i can t stress that enough i don t think people in the valley know what a truly romantic french dining experience is this place is cozy as in the nyc definition meaning that it is small cramped loud you will hear all the conversations around you which in ots can get pretty ridiculous and it is guaranteed that you will either ask the table next to you what they are eating or be asked what you are eating both happened to us to top it off there was a very bright fake candle on the table in an absolutely horrid candle holder lastly they had the most ridiculous music playing seriously i heard the canne canne blaring out of the speakers and all i could think of was the old shoprite commercial with the dancing cans a real romantic french dining experience is quiet reserved sophisticated and of course has real candles on the table and classier music if any at all we had a 7 00 reservation and wound up getting there 15 min early and the table wasn t ready which was totally fine we could just grab a glass of champagne at the bar there were two open seats but the bar top had place settings in front of them so i asked the bartender if we could grab a quick drink there while our table was being prepared he informed me that those spots had been reserved and unnecessarily relegated us to a tiny spot at the corner of the bar our table was ready in about 7 minutes in that time the reserved seats at the bar were never filled ugh the food was good but not the best french food i ve had i was expecting more classical french and this was definitely more provencal we went with four courses first we shared the escargot which was ok anything drowning in butter and garlic is going to be but the pastry dough on top was hard and chewy and not flakey next i had the foie gras which again was good but not the best i ve had it was unfortunately a little flavorless i really like to taste the nuttiness of foie gras my wife had the steak tartare and had the same remark that it was basically flavorless for our entree we split the bouillabaisse which was quite good however it is served with a few pieces of toasted bread with a roasted red pepper sauce that was just totally unnecessary the whole point of the bread is to soak up the broth of the bouillabaisse so i had to ask for some plain toasted bread which was happily provided to finish we had the cheese plate which was again pretty unremarkable a gruyere a bleu a brie and i forget what the last cheese was see unremarkable onto the service firstly the reason why a real classy french restaurant would not survive in the valley is because people are too impatient a four course meal can and should be a 2 hour experience eat a little drink a little gaze lovingly into your partner s eyes have deep conversations about life many of the patrons here complained that their food was taking too long to the point where our waiter kept apologizing to us without our saying anything and i had to reassure him that we actually appreciated the pace of the meal our server chad was fantastic he recommended a great by the glass wine that was not on the menu when our second course arrived after the escargot i had to ask for a change of plates and utensils to which he exclaimed of course and hurried to get after that the plates and silverware were changed after every course chad was very attentive to us without being overbearing even though it appeared he was the only server for half of the restaurant he may have been a little too apologetic at times but i will take that over totally obnoxious and uncaring lastly to the value our 4 course meal well a split first and last course 2 glasses champagne 3 glasses wine came to 145 to me that is a great value for french food of course i may be a little out of touch as our last french cuisine experience was at joel robouchon in las vegas which came to 600 in all honesty i probably won t ever return to petite maison it is definitely a special occasion type of place and there are nicer better places that i like more
  since becoming pregnant all i can stomach on a regular basis is pizza and this place has been steady in the rotation we almost always eat there and have always had good friendly efficient service have tried several of the apps and they are very good typically get a salad and small pizza and it always seems to hit the spot the only reason i am not giving 5 stars is b c i was told they couldn t make a calzone without ricotta and that just seems strange to me and when this baby mom is not in the mood for ricotta this simply will not do
  we re actually pretty fond of this place the only thing is when you walk into a restaurant with this kind of atmosphere the decor is usually pretty cheap i ve only eaten here a handful of times the employees were always nice but the food takes forever seating is also great i m not a big fan of thin and greasy pizza my thing is papa john s thin and greasy pizza has never really had any flavor besides what i just listed i do like their chicken lettuce mayo sandwich though and their garlic rolls are good too i would go back
  craving something different from the usual indian takeaways i usually go for i decided to try out jade palace as it is located right next to my girlfriend s flat my main experience of chinese food has been courtesy of jimmy chung s and as this is pretty much mass produced i expected something a little different from jade palace however i was disappointed the cantonese style sweet and sour i had was certainly nothing to get too excited about and the friend rice i had alongside was also fairly unspectacular although still fairly nice to eat the prawn crackers were also very similar to those that i could buy from the supermarket for about half the price the saving grace was the curry sauce and noodles that my girlfriend ordered the curry sauce was deliciously smooth and not grainy as is often the case the noodles proved to be jammed tight into the foil container and as a result the portion was very generous the prices seemed fairly standard they did not strike me as particularly cheap but they also did not make my jaw drop to the floor as other chinese takeaways have done overall if you re nearby and are desperately craving a bit of chinese takeaway this is fine however if possible shop around first to avoid too much disappointment
  first time here this place was amazing nice outdoor setting colored lighting for a fun atmosphere i choose to sit at the high style bar tables nice to be able to look straight into your waiters face didn t get a chance to see inside the rest of the place my husband had a margarita and traditional chile relleno and chicken cranberry and spice relleno i had the appetizer mini taco combo hibiscus chicken and pork with spices and raisin i think it s a must go to place to eat whether you live there or just visiting will go back if we get a chance
  i came here on monday night with my family the food at the buffet isn t bad it s decent however i had just gone to the bachannal buffet at ceasar s palace the night before and had high expectations for this buffet i love that buffet so much i m pretty much biased when comparing it to any other buffet my first indication that it wouldn t be like bachannal should ve been the fact that there was no wait to get seated all the way in the back of the buffet is the beverage machines and a bar where they give out complimentary beer and wine there is a variety of food to choose some on the left side you have american italian pizza seafood soup and the meat carving station on the right side of the buffet there is chinese sushi salad and dessert the usual that you will get at a buffet the best part of my meal was probably the dessert yum
  i m dying for another good local breakfast place in chandler i had high hopes for us egg but i can t recommend it the food was bland not in a good way coffee was weak and the service was slow i m sticking with the good egg or 24 carrots even mimi s is better i m not a fan of large corporate restaurants
  yuck i didn t like anything about it service was incredibly slow we went for lunch and it took at least 20 minutes for our food to come i ordered beef panang it was really overcooked the beef tasted like mushy baby food plus i ordered 6 on spicy level and it was not at all spicy my husband ordered pork eggrolls i couldn t figure out how half was hot and half ice cold his fried rice had pork that was good beef tasted old and weird he picked out the beef his food also came a very long time before mine did and i was starving and 2 lunches were 40 with the tip panang 13 fried rice 13 iced tea and eggrolls final opinion i wouldn t eat here again if it was free disgusting i wish they had a negative star for the worst place you have ever been
  went here last night with my boyfriend and was not disappointed it s a pretty small space so expect to wait a little while even if you go there on a week night the bar is great and drinks are reasonably priced we didn t get an appetizer but we both had burgers that were very good he had the classic burger and i had the pimento cheese burger the pepper jam is to die for both of our burgers were a little bit more well done than we would have liked we like ours medium rare a little more towards rare but still good i am gluten free and was very impressed with their gluten free menu it s pretty extensive and they offer gluten free buns which is great and definitely not something you get everywhere the fries were decent but as my boyfriend pointed out tasted like something you can buy at the grocery store and make yourself didn t get to try a milkshake as we were so full but next time that will definitely be the first thing i order
  this place is easy relatively cheap fast buffet great place to go to for lunch breakfast if you want something simple like fresh fruits and an omelet the ice cream waffle cones are great too hint the half price tix place have discounts for this place on the weekdays we paid less than 10 for lunch so felt like we got our worth just eating some fruits and getting lots of oj and we didn t have to wait at all
  among food network viewers and celebrity chef followers chef scott conant is bordering on household name territory these days here in the states it s hard to miss him as he has popped up on 24 hour restaurant battle top chef chopped and even no reservations recently so with the crew of pizzahunt net firmly entrenched in las vegas at the international pizza expo why the hell would we not want to eat some pizza at his latest endeavor located inside the brand new the cosmopolitan hotel casino named d o c g enoteca wood fired pizza is all the rage around the united states make no mistake about it however with so many folks getting into the game these days we are beginning to see a separation between those in the know and those just pretending to know so call us natural born skeptics every time we step foot in a wood fired place d o c g enoteca is a quant place with about 20 25 tables inside the walls and another 15 20 outside it also features a fully stocked bar with food service the wood fired oven is centerpiece of the dining room as it should be you may expect the service to be on the stuffy side at a joint like this but we found it quite the opposite after ordering a straight margherita with buffalo mozz we were served an array of fresh breads and breadsticks nothing shocking about it just solid and fresh about 4 minutes later our pizza hit the table the first thing we noticed was a little less char than we are accustomed to on wood fired pies baking at about 700 degrees btw overall though we were impressed with the look of the pizza on the taste front d o c g is nearly perfect in our eyes they feature a buffalo mozzarella that is very creamy with a slight tartness that we loved the sauce was clearly fresh pressed tomatos and the crust had a great spring to it while being chewy and charred but what really tied all of this together for us was the use of sea salt on the finished product and the fresh basil sure i know how this discussion goes customers can apply their own salt to taste etc in our opinion we shouldn t have to though the chef should cook to taste and the finished product should be ready to roll period i think we have been fortunate enough to eat some of the better wood fired margherita pizzas in the country and scott conant s d o c g enoteca ranks pretty high we look forward to going back and you should too
  great food the honey butter that comes with the sweet potato fries is delicious it s like a sweet condensed milk texture taste but better burger is pretty tasty too the price range is not bad and portion is just right the sunny side up burger is awesome they also asks you how would you like the egg cooked they also have the build your own burger salad option if you d like to be creative oh and they have a good selections of beer too
  amazing tip if you can t get into sw go here same menu and dare i say i think my steak was better here than the night we ate at sw delish
  we go here after softball games on thursday night the drinks are cheap the food is great and the service is outstanding the biggest draw to this place is the bar itself it has lots of pool tables and dart boards two huge patios that overlook the green belt and lots of tvs my only complaint is the karaoke they do on thursday it is horrible and ruins the whole vibe there oh and they have the no dui car that will drive you home for free but don t forget to tip
  we recently visited lon s for my in laws 50th anniversary celebration great evening except for the food although the food presentation was nice the dishes had no flavor i ordered the braised short ribs with truffle gnocchi these should be full of flavor and it was bland no truffle flavor whatsoever two in our party ordered the chefs tasting menu again flavor was not there everyone shared bites at the table to confirm we had a party of 12 and other than one person who ordered the filet everyone was disappointed with their entree it was early august so the restaurant was not overly busy for the prices they are charging the food should wow and it did not the worst part was the staff was ambivalent to the comments we made when told to contact the manager he hasn t returned our call try someplace else u
  my review is only based on my experience with the all you can eat lunch stopped in for the all you can eat lunch buffet at the suggestion of a friend whom said it was good the food quality was not too bad service was pretty good and it seemed like a nice clean place the lunch deal is 14 person and not really a buffet but you can order unlimited off a small menu it was a pretty slim sushi roll selection and about 8 different nigiri choices only about 4 fish options for nigiri they also offer rice or spring rolls which was cool and the spring rolls were good and came out fast not amazing but the fish tasted fresh and the service was good will i be back someday sure i would like to try them for dinner sometime with a more expanded menu option
  more like botchanal buffet let me start by saying that i don t usually take the time to review things on yelp because i feel other people will usually do a good job of posting accurate reviews with that said i usually write a review when something is really good really bad or i disagree with the majority of reviews here s my review this place is overrated i ve been to buffets that are 50 cheaper and have the same quality selection and better service granted we had a very responsive busboy and server but man the hosts and hostesses could not count or prioritize to save their lives we ended up waiting 265 minutes total then when we got to the front of the line the joke stess called forward a party behind us she told us we would only have to wait 2 more minutes which turned out to be 30 more minutes we had to complain to the manager in order to be seated and finally when the rope line was opened for us to go sit down the hostess miscounted the number of people in our group by a large amount whether for lack of attention or inability to count they obviously were not running the place competently similar to what another reviewer stated we got to our table to find that there were plenty of open tables that would have accommodated our group we also saw that they seated a party with less people than ours at a table meant for 8 o_o ok enough of the introductions let s get on to the food many people seemed crazy about the crab legs i guess many people go to buffets only for the crab i go for everything typically buffet food is a little stale because it kinda sits there for a while for the price this place charges you would think their food would be a little different not the case this food is your usual crusty edged garbage that results from being over exposed to warming lamps the variety of options was also not impressive even if there were items that are not normally at a traditional buffet people didn t choose them they just remained in the heating lamps drying out my guess is that there is a reason some dishes are not typically served at buffets overall this place felt on par with other buffets that charge around 20 25 dollars save your money time and the headache for something else p s be prepared for annoying people taking cellphone pictures of all the food
  really good great meat and sides helpful staff they also give you a free dessert if you rate them on yelp so definitely do that
  tap sports bar just opened about a month ago they are located in the mgm towards the back of the casino parallel to the sports book a very nice open space with lots of tv s to watch all the games in action definitely a good spot to go especially if all the chairs in the sports book is full they have a good menu with plenty of yummy eats and drinks it was kinda late when we arrived and had about 5min to get our order in because the kitchen closes at 11pm fries and gravy http www yelp com biz_photos tap las vegas select jek35fcnfybussaqmusqmw jek35fcnfybussaqmusqmw this bowl was huge it has fries and fried cheese curds those are the brown pudgy looking ones the gravy had a decent taste could have used a bit more of it though braised bacon corn dogs http www yelp com biz_photos tap las vegas select jek35fcnfybussaqmusqmw waznbntffh30oujvbdx6iq this one confused me a bit and was not sure what to expect instead of a hot dog i felt like i was eating a stick of corned beef wrapped with bacon whatever though it was pretty damn good so i was totally ok with it it had a really tasty mustard sauce that came with it that i really enjoyed buffalo wings http www yelp com biz_photos tap las vegas select jek35fcnfybussaqmusqmw xhsxeyv7jom3w1qgmfrqfw these were finger licking good you can actually choose from 4 different sauces and the waiter recommended to stick with the buffalo and we were glad we did i could have had another basket of these wings this was probably not the healthiest thing to eat at midnight but hey were in vegas eyes wow i get to eat all this so late at night nose smells yum ear still a few peeps hanging around mouth these are all pretty good tummy i m going to make you pay in the morning for stuffing me up at midnight
  holy cow the chicken fried steak eggs were huge and amazing the pot of bread was delicious but a little soggy on the bottom i should have went with the toast to sop up my yolk or maybe both would have been a good idea i needed a good steak and egg place to frequent and now i have found it i will be back
  great food great fresh drinks went there after seeing it on tv wasn t feeling up to the big del rey torta so ordered a regular one which was still great everything we had was good and we ordered 4 or 5 things to try
  yet another groupon alert i just can t say no when i see a place in my area offer a groupon the place was just ok i ordered the spicy chicken bowl and although i like the heat i wasn t a huge fan of the flavor it had a sweet flavor that i disliked and i wasn t a big fan of the rice the shrimp tempura we shared was ok and the orange chicken and chicken teriyaki i tried from both my fella and my mom s plate were pretty tasty i liked the texture of the orange chicken despite not typically liking the orange sauce most places use all in all it s a good little fast food teriyaki place i d recommend it for a quick on the go meal but it s just ok overall i d probably go back but only if i had another coupon
  aside from the lame service and how slow you get the food and how you have to fight for tables the french onion soup wasn t too salty which i like the proscuitto sammie was actually quite delicious the proscuitto was full of that sweet cured taste and the provolone was mildly piquant the pizza tasted pretty good but by then i was starting to feel the affects of the alcomoholllllllllllllllll the salad was crisp and fresh and i think my friend yacked a little somewhere in the restaurant sorry
  good food and portions service and staff were great i had a pretty satisfying experience
  disgusting i m here right now and it smells horrible like urine note to jasons deli clean your bathrooms thoroughly if you have tables 8 tables near the restroom remember people are eating and dont want to smell pee
  i have very mixed feelings about this place i reviewed the mckellips location a couple times once a great review and once a bad review now we ve been to the gilbert location a few times now on saturday for happy hour while my sons at his guitar lesson their house margaritas are really good and cheap during happy hour 3 or 4 bucks i think their chips and green salsa are also very good but you have to pay for them in the bar at least during happy hour had the nachos once but realized the beans aren t vegetarian so i won t be having them again i m sure we ll go again for happy hour but that s probably about it one thing i absolutely love is the decor so cute and charming love it
  so lucky to slip in this place with a party of 24 for thanksgiving just wandering around looking for a place to eat the food was excellent and the pricing reasonable for the quality they quickly setup an area for us and the waitress was amazing very cool i m from marin ca and we have to pay the same prices for very average food this was a treat and on thanksgiving no less
  i was feeling chinese so i chose this place from the yelp reviews glad i did service was on the spot the food was great it was a pretty inexpensive meal in top of that looks like i ll be adding this place to my musts
  you must try the potato cake appetizer comes with a yummy goat cheese cream sauce that makes me want to lick the plate clean sir edmund s has a cozy hole in the wall atmosphere and great food my husband loves the fish and chips and i love everything i ve tried there it s not exactly a cheap date but the quality of service and food makes it worth it i ve never ordered anything complicated from the bar we usually stick to draft beers unless it s half price wine night
  lovely cocktails and pasta its a nice place service is excellent really love the decor and outdoor seating it is very convenient as i live nearby food is amazing
  an unexpected surprise we were taking a friend out for her birthday and thanks to yelp again we discovered this place a rather authentic european bistro in glendale glendale of all of places the food was phenomenal the garlic bread tartin the fondue the crepes the salted caramel fondue all of it i really don t think you can go wrong with anything on the menu we chatted extensively with our waiter and also a gentleman who i believe is the owner he was very friendly and had a great sense of humor we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will be back
  we decided to go and try out their unlimited pasta we were seated right away but no one came to take our order i had to ask one of the waitresses if she could send our waitress to our table after that she came moments later the pasta is 9 99 and you have the option to add meatballs or chicken for 2 99 my friend got the chicken and i got the meatballs and we both ordered the alfredo the bowl was a good decent size and mines had two large meatballs my friend finished his first and wanted his second bowl but then he was told if he wanted more chicken he had to pay another 2 99 we were shocked and so he ate his pasta without chicken we then asked for boxes and they said they don t give boxes when the unlimited pasta is ordered i asked to speak to the manager and he really didn t want to give us boxes i told him you guys are only going to throw it away so what s the big deal of letting me take the food that i paid for home one of his responses was we should already know they don t allow boxes with the unlimited pasta and he even compared it to running a red light he said everyone knows not to run a red light i told him that s against the law and its written in the handbook nowhere does it say you cannot take the pasta home so to end it he says i ll bring one box and runs off he didn t even give me a chance to respond to him so i had to stuff both of our food into one box even though the pasta was good i m never going back because of that experience and on top of that their food is overpriced we should ve just went to bubba gump
  hate to say it but the el sombrero we once loved to visit is no more my wife s salad was obviously old lettuce my wife s dinner of an enchilada taco beans and rice was awful in every way the enchilada was dried out the taco meat was cool the beans tasted spoiled and the rice had obviously either been in a pan overcooking all day or just simply old rice that was reheated i had the same meal regrettably except i ordered a chile relleno as well other than the relleno which was average at best my meal was equally bad sorry to say this is one restaurant whose time appears to have gone in ten plus years eating here it has never been bad except this recent vist notably i did not see the familiar faces of the ladies who we ve seen so many times in the past maybe the restaurant was sold changed hands whatever the reason i will not recommend this place again
  my husband daughter and i have been going here for over a year and absolutely love it aside from everyone being so incredibly nice and attentive the food here is just fantastic we initially came here for the sushi but chen talked us into trying one of the korean bowls and now we re addicted we have not had one bad meal here the prices are very reasonable the restaurant super clean service quick couldn t ask for anything better they also have a couple of plasma tvs which are usually tuned to a sporting event which my husband loves contrary to a previous review we did not find the menu confusing at all it was very organized and descriptive which is very helpful for the special sushi rolls highly highly recommend this place
  fine italian dining at a reasonable price and by reasonable i mean it s less expensive than a michelin starred french restaurant the atmosphere is pretty fancy high ceilings white table clothes snooty looking hosts and waiters however looks are deceiving this is a family style restaurant disguised as a fine dining we went here with 6 adults and 2 young children arriving a little too early for dinner they let us wait inside i was hoping they d give us some free appetizers but no such luck they seated us right at 5p and seats started filling up fast so it was probably a good idea we got there early we ordered 5 of the pasta trios and i ordered the zuppe di pesce seafood stew the pasta was good i wouldn t say it was amazing but definitely worth the price 20 for just the pasta but yo u can add a ceasar salad and desert for i think 7 for people that don t know everyday there are 3 different pasta dishes the chef makes for this pasta trio they have servers for each of the individual pastas pretty neat imo they give you a sampling of the 3 at first which quite honestly was plenty then you can pick one two or even all three for the subsequent rounds i don t know if it s all you can eat but even the big eaters were done after their 3rd plate there is a child s menu but our kids eat like birds so we asked if they could have a little of the pasta the servers were very accomodating bringing everyone plates to share my wife ordered the pasta trio with a salad and desert the ceasar was perfect she shared it with me and she had tiramisu that was probably the best we ve ever had the zuppe di pesce my entree was amazing i m a seafood lover though overall i d say this is an upgraded version of olive garden which is not a bad thing
  seriously my fav place it has a drive thru which makes it 5 stars love the chicken fried rice and garlic chicken love the owner too everything i ve tried i ve liked and love that they added a white meat chicken menu this place isn t fancy it s just pure awesome i can t wait until they open today
  last night i was craving something to eat and since it was 9pm on a monday not too many options to choose from but i was excited to see that tacos jalisco was open so i headed down for some late night grub i ordered the chile rellano plate which is two chile rellano s and rice and beans the food was great but very tough to eat with plastic silverware next time i get these i ll just order to go they have coca cola in the bottle which to me is always a plus cause it is so much better than american coca cola so ya check this place out if you are in the area
  we visited the hash house on a thursday around 3 00 pm although there were many tables available they still made us wait the food is really good but i only gave it 2 stars because the music was so loud that we couldn t carry on a conversation much less hear our waitress when she took our order we couldn t wait to get out of there as we all had headaches from the noise
  a good steakhouse in the burbs is rare so echo and rig can easily lay claim to being one of the best located in the perennially empty tivoli village the modern open two story space features a butcher shop and bar on the first level and the main dining room and patio on the second the menu is dominated by appetizers and small plates the best of the bunch might be the portobello fries 9 80 with their crispy crunchy fried exterior if you like fried foods try the lamb cigars 8 10 too a thin crispy egg roll like wrapper covers a savory lamb mixture and is accompanied by a tzatziki sauce less successful was an excessively oily gratin 5 90 full of caramelized onions roasted pumpkin squash sage and gruyere you may want to avoid the steak tartare 8 10 as well not only is it the least appetizing looking dish there the mushy texture made it doubly unappealing craving a salad they ve got some good ones like a kale salad 8 with baby yellow beets toasted hazelnuts goat cheese and a citrus vinaigrette if you want one with a little more substance the arugula salad comes with plenty of prosciutto and is large enough for two to share as for main entrees the spencer steak 27 70 is a solid choice it s a prime grade center cut rib eye that had a modest amount of charring and a savoriness that was enhanced by their mushroom sauce a rich and earthy accompaniment that surpassed their other complimentary sauces brussels sprouts are all the rage these days and their version 8 10 was enhanced with pistachios that added a nice crunch and salinity to the dish even better was a grilled summer corn 5 90 dish showcasing a char and smokiness that reminded me of eating corn on the cob straight from the grill but without the mess or random kernels stuck in between my teeth not to be overlooked is their butcher blend burger 12 40 a great savory and juicy blend of chuck and brisket topped with lettuce tomato red onions and the optional sharp cheddar cheese it s a simple burger that s well proportioned and executed beautifully they don t have a kid s menu but were happy to strip down their roasted chicken sandwich 12 to accommodate my son s tastes chicken and cheese on ciabatta prices are reasonable for their location and while it s on the higher end of the spectrum of what suburbanites may want to pay off strip the solid and safe menu makes it a sure bet for most diners
  the veggie house is one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas for a clean healthy meal there is no equal to the wonderful dishes that chef kenny creates the very friendly wait staff and the meals have never failed the roti with chicken curry is outstanding
  i wish i could rate this pizza hut less than one star worst customer experience ever it was so bad that i called pizza hut corporate four times and the regional manager could not even handle the issues i will never order from this pizza hut again
  this place is super swank great for people watching and the food service are top notch here are the highlights bone in ribeye awesome but a bit fatty just the way i like it perfectly cooked and great flavor filet melts in your mouth shrimp coctail with atomic horse radish how can shrimp as big as your hand be bad roast corn sweet and crunchy potatoes au gratin potatoey cheesy goodness here are the lowlights the wedge salad is sub par and not steakhouse quality at all the bar area is too cramped and it was a mess for our waiters and servers to maneuver no way i m sitting there for dinner next time i would however sit there and have some drinks while listening to the piano player singer no pretzel bread yes everything is pretty pricey but its just about what other high end steak joints are anyway i can t wait to return and hope to do so asap
  i am may be picky but i can tear apart a blue crab like nobody s business i consider myself an expert in this area as i grew up around the baltimore md area home of the blue crab if you ask anyone who knows anything about how to get it done i told one of the owners john that wouldn t it just figure that 3 weeks before i am leaving las vegas i would find blue crabs after 20 years i actually reconsidered my plan to move after eating here i am not even kidding but then john offered to ship the crabs to d i a for me and i decided to stick to my plan to move to denver but i digress as usual this place is legit too legit to quit if you ask me i went with my dad who is in town from the md area i knew that he would be the one to experience crab corner with me we already knew that we were set on splitting an order of 2 males but what else to get boardwalk fries stop it right now as i bit into the fry i was immediately taken back to ocean city md and then the crabs came that were so fresh and prepared perfectly with old bay sprinkled all over their bodies h e a v e n and then i just read below that utz potato chips are on the way all i can say about that is i already have 2 dates set to go back and visit the crab corner before my departure from vegas on january 8 and you better believe that every time i come into town to visit this will be on my list of top stops thank you crab corner for bringing a little piece of my hometown to my homeplace las vegas
  best read with the accompaniment of film noir music and a crisp city inflection it was hot muggy like a coffee holder hot i had picked a bad week to quit the smokes but business had dried up and i hadn t seen a case since an advertisement for lunch boxes slipped out of my copy for the evening times i shouldn t have been surprised when she walked into my room looking like sex and trouble hell she was staying with me for crying out loud but the lady was a specimen in short hemlines and legs that needed their own mile markers she had told me she had a proposition for me and no sooner had the words escaped past her lipstick i had flung my two button blazer over my shoulder and offered her the suddenly lonely inner crook of my elbow the lady had needs and unfortunately for me they all revolved around food thankfully i always keep running reservations at two or three spots around town for just such a need so we strolled out of the room towards sustenance i kept my roscoe in my other coat because something told me this night would have more to do with fending off the looks of local roustabouts than plugging some unlucky sucker between the eyeballs and if it came down to it i d gladly come to fisticuffs with some palooka in order to get things back on the straight and easy we moseyed into botero around a half after six less than twelve and i told the dolls at the desk that the dame i was with needed to have her rump sat at a table that d fit the bill and then to make my case i slipped them each a sawbuck and winked like a one eyed man they looked out at the empty restaurant and then asked me why i was talking like that and i told them lip would only get them an overbite so they took the bait and led us to what i no doubt believe was the best seat in the joint this botero fellow was a columbian and my last run in with them had left me two slugs light and a pocket full of spinach but i decided to curb that story and pulled out the roundheels chair we were seated at the center of attention the best spot in the house right behind the eight foot ass crack of the centerpiece statue the stool pigeon at the table next to us recommended the ahi tuna tartare so we called for that with some of the graacher himmelreich because hey the wars been over for a couple of years and i m not the only gi who s gone too long without having a good german wine it smelled like bubblegum and tasted like the sweetness she was dishing me with eyelashes that looked more like tiny come hither fingers problem is my name s not hither the sommelier was a real flash in the pan if you ask me nice guy with all the right answers for the questions i asked but was i asking the right questions we split the caprese salad because everything italian has moxie and the burrata cheese forced me to look this prize horse in the mouth we considered each other for a couple of seconds before continuing on for dinner she fileted the mignon petitely and i scalloped from day boats with the chef gerrymandering my dish and turning it into a real tomato the man with the vino smarts spun a tale on meritage and the lady went french and we ate like helen keller sang with our hands it s a good thing the vitis vinifera worked cuz if it hadn t i might ve had to squirt some metal always keep the midget in my sock overall this dump is a real snazzy joint and i m glad this jasper botero chose to open it from the grave don t indulge on too much hooch over near the bar whoever designed it ran of room and decided to get all hanky panky with the ceiling which would be fine if ceiling was a misspelling of celine some cocktail doll with too much time on her hands but unfortunately that ain t the case we sauntered out on our getaway sticks trying not to appear hinky she was a looker and i was a gumshoe and we were in the thick of our food comas thoroughly satiated we took it on the heel and toe but not before she kissed me like her tongue had a message from a snitch i guess that s what i get for making reservations like indiana jones choosing wisely
  i am a big fan of the hofbrauhaus maybe it s the beer maybe it s the live music or maybe it s the atmosphere who knows i must be all three right ok always get the jumbo complete don t pass it up it s basically a large pretzel with cheese and mustard great appetizer but sometimes i need more than one have a good time swing your glasses and dance all you like
  so the first thing i have to say is that the food here is amazing if you care about nothing else except the taste of your food go here if you care about things like customer service and appropriate wait times at the university location not the other one i would suggest not vising this restaurant i ve had many experiences with cornish pasty my friends love it and when it comes to the food i love it too especially the pork pasty i ve only had one good one though and that was when i sat directly at the bar and told the woman standing there what i wanted the a few of the other times happened something like this 1 went in alone waited fifteen minutes for anyone to come over and even wipe down my table let alone ask for a drink or dinner order 2 went there with 4 other friends waited 2 hours for a table and the gentleman acting the host was especially rude when we would ask him about how long he thought it would be roughly ever 30 minutes and he always said looks like 15 more minutes then when we were finally seated our drinks came back half empty and my pasty was cold in the center the truth is is that while the food is great the company needs to retrain it s workers customer service should be at the top of their list and from what i can tell it s at the bottom
  i have eaten here twice for lunch and both times it was wednesday which meant a gyro lunch special you get a healthy size gyro with fries a side of tzatziki and a fountain soda for 6 50 with tax each weekday is a different special so i will be back to try more dishes at lunch there is outside seating and several tables indoors the owners take orders cook and bring your food out they seem like nice hardworking folks this is a yummy fast lunch place on mill that us easy on the wallet
  my husband and i had dinner here last night and we were truly thrilled with our experience while it has only been open about a week now you would think they have been there forever the service was flawless i was especially intrigued when i viewed their website which stated that the chef does not use mayonnaise heavy butter sauces and heavy cream sauces and that he can create meals just as tasty without the fat and i must say this is not a lie the food was amazing my husband was extremely happy with his meal of chicken sausage flatbread and lamb meatballs made with moroccan spices feta almonds carrot salad and pomegranate bbq sauce he kept saying you have to yelp this place lol i tried everything my husband ordered plus the organic vegetarian plate which was also delicious for drinks i had the calistro classic martini made with organic vodka yes organic vodka and very tasty calistro marinated olives they also have an amazing wine list which i will have to start trying next time our waiter adam was awesome helpful friendly and efficient and seemed to have a great passion for food and wine the ambience is also especially beautiful around sunset as the restaurant has lots of glass to allow lots of beautiful natural light cannot recommend this restaurant enough my husband and i will be back many times we are very happy to have such a great restaurant in our neighborhood
  i have been wanting to try this place since it opened so when my friend was in town visiting and we were going to haze that night and needed a place to have dinner first well it just seemed that the stars have finally aligned for me the place it s self looked nice i know it s called a pub but by the looks it is definitely a restaurant first our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu i had the lobster roll and it was good i was expecting something different it ended being what you would call maybe lobster roll sliders still good but not what i expected for dessert i had the chocolate cake and i must say it was very good extremely rich the highlight of my experience was on my way out i took the beer chug challenge to be honest that was probably the main reason i was there well it was a victory for me i got my free beer i will definitely be back and with the pressure of not having to take the challenge i m sure it will be a greater experience
  ok let me start of saying that i love popeyes and was super excited that one was opening close by my house i ve been here 3 times and each thine the wait was loooonnnggg the first time i came was through drive thru not too bad except for the wait time second time i went to the counter and order the chicken meal after waiting almost 15 minutes my number is called i looked down at my tray and realized they gave me tenders immediately i bring it to their attention and they lady said hold on i need to get a a manager really i have my receipt in front of you and you can see the order is wrong they ended up fixing the order after i had to wait another 5 minutes as i m sitting there looking around i realize there are 6 employees on their break eating don t get me wrong everyone is entitled to their break but when there is a long line of people then perhaps that many people shouldn t be able to go at once the third time i came was in drive thru again omg the girl couldn t get my order right even after repeating it 3 times i ordered 3 separate items with the third one being a chicken strip meal at no time did she ask me what side item i wanted or my drink i sat there waiting to see if she would ask she hands me the bag and tries to send me off i ask her what about my side and drink don t you want to know what i want she said oh i rang it up as ala carte i looked at her and explained the whole conversation and said i wanted mash potatoes can she please give it to me and i ll pay for it she ended up giving it to us for free but it still doesn t make up for the bad customer service when i brought the chicken home it was a bit undercooked if you want chicken and don t mind canes then go there if you have your heart set on popeyes then drive a little further to the one on craig road trust me it will be worth the drive this place is so new and so disorganized and the people have no clue on what they are doing i will not be back at this location
  i noticed this place a few months ago and today i decided to stop in let s just say my tummy is glad i did i intended to only get one cupcake and my free cake pop for checking in but all the different kinds looked so good and the lady was so nice that i decided to splurge and get two next time i ll probably end up getting three haha in my opinion the key to a good cupcake is the cake itself if it s not moist then it s not worth eating i had the tres leches and smore s cupcakes and both had very moist cake and lots of frosting i liked that each flavor had a little personality with the various toppings they look good and taste even better my favorite thing however was the free cake pop i could eat those all day the one i had was chocolate cake dipped in chocolate and it was like a truffle in cake form so good next time you re craving something sweet support this local business and get a cupcake cake pop you won t regret it
  needless to say i am sorry i spent my money there that night but it will never happen again because i will not step foot in there again terrible food pinky s right up the street has much better food terrible service inattentive and rude horrible management if anyone asks about this establishment i will make sure i point them to pinky s and i will make sure all of my foodie friends know the plethora of great places to get a burger on montford when their woodlawn location signage is first erected waste of money btw those who say they have great burgers on the reviews obviously haven t been to brooks charlotte mainsta y the burger equivalent to price s chicken coop the liberty some of the best high end burger ever google em see the accolades or zack s
  happened by this hidden gem and decided to stop for dinner they have live music and they just started all day happy hour on thursdays i had the beef tenderloin which was made perfectly also the wedge salad which is made with butter lettuce instead of iceberg i like that much better recommend and will return the rest of the menu is very interesting
  words cannot say enough how much this place rocks staff is always friendly and outgoing love them the food is always bomb and well worth every penny i get my coffee from them almost every morning and when i get food it s always fresh and perfectly done thanks guys keep up the awesome work you do
  i ve thought about fast food pizza and dominos was always one i considered fast good that being said i was wrong their pizza was really impressive make sure you get the thin crust xtra sauce and you have some really good pizza thanks dominos
  the sandwiches are always delicious here the breakfast not so much i went in this morning at 830 and 70 of their baked goods were gone not to mention the lady working the counter was a grouch she also made my coffee completely wrong so if you make your way to breadcrafters stick with lunch
  i love this place and if i lived closer i would come here every day i ve had breakfast twice here with my boyfriend i so want to branch out my order but both times i ordered the hog and chick with bacon and hashbrowns thick cut delicious peppered bacon and crispy on top soft in the middle hashbrowns what more could you want the thick slices of toast with jam are a really nice touch and the honey lemonade is to die for my boyfriend always gets the five spot breakfast sandwich that has eggs bacon onions and cheese on a fresh roll de lish next time we go i plan on trying the pancakes i always eye them enviously when i m there when you get there simply put your name on the list and the number in your party the pad is usually on top of the water cooler by the door then grab a seat in the shade if you can find one and wait anxiously for your name to be called don t let the wait detour you it s completely worth it now that it s cooling down the wait won t be so unbearable especially if you re like me and want your weekend brunch around 1 i ve waited about 30 mins on average the restaurant is small and there are only a few tables but it doesn t feel crowded the staff is super friendly and quick with your orders you can usually hear some good tunes coming out of the kitchen the prices are beyond reasonable for the quality of food that you get you will leave full happy and extremely satisfied
  went here last week for trivia while some coworkers were in town and it was the best time location near our office inside is pretty dark it took awhile for my eyes to adjust to the lack of bright lighting we sat ourselves at a high top near the entrance and started with some drinks and apps i indulged in mostly malibus and cokes that night to start we shared an order of boneless wings and quesadilla both of which i enjoyed we hung out a little bit and waited for trivia to get going before we ordered dinner i had the grilled turkey and swiss sandwich with fries which i thoroughly enjoyed but i am also big into any combination of turkey and cranberry our server was super nice and becoming of recommendations and whatnot i asked if they had dragonberry rum and when they didn t she got a sample of another type of rum and coke to see if i liked it we had a good time it s out of my hood but i do have a gift certificate so i ll be back in the near future
  this place looks great but no one who works there really cares about anything sunday breakfast over at 11 00am boo no brunch food took long which would have been ok if our food was made correctly it wasn t both burgers were cooked rare instead of medium also they brought out the wrong burger to my friend all together or rather put on extra condiments that weren t listed on the menu my mini mac and cheese was a little soupy tasted ok i will say the garlic fries were really really good pizza was greasy and not crisp you gotta be fast or you gotta be good neither happened for us today wasn t cheap either our server was kind of a d bag the manager wasn t too friendly but the hostesses and food runners were helpful update the manager tells me they are open for breakfast all day
  cheap beers is the main reason to come here i think 2 for a 20 oz microbrew unfortunately the beers i tried ipa and amber were nuttin special 2 is a fair price the craps table was closed at about 11 pm on a friday night we had a group of 5 people just dying to lose some money playing craps they still wouldn t open the table and were all put off that we would even dare ask hmph undeterred we played a bit of blackjack until the pit boss told us the table was going to be closed after that deck what the heck this is the only casino in vegas that will actively try to not take your money no matter how badly you want to get rid of it we took our business elsewhere mediocre beers dummies running the tables and tons and tons of cigarette smoke i don t have a reason to go back
  best vegan food ever and much less pretentious than chuchai super friendly staff nice clean semi sous sol location slightly cheezey decor and music i was going to dock them a star for not being licenced but i don t think buddhists drink so i ll let it go this time everyone raves about this general tao s tofu but i thought the gen tao s chick n was far better
  so i ve come here about 4 times each time it was closed today i finally got here early enough family owned and very clean now to the food my hubby got the grilled salmon boy was it fresh absolutely delish i got the garlic chicken it was a heaping helping and and was the best i ve had oh yes i ll be back
  great food perfect service food is fresh i strongly recommend coming here for sure coming back soon
  we took the horseback ride from south ponderosa stables with the restaurant as the destination as restaurants go it was okay the salad bar is pretty unimaginative i mean you can do more that a bowl of lettuce and some bowl of dressing and in fairness they did have green beans in a savory sauce but it was pretty much water with little to enhance the beans my wife s cheeseburger was vary good and my boneless rib eye tasted great except that it was fully half gristle and fat the sides were fine my drink order was screwed up they brought the wrong brand but i drank it anyway rather than complicate an already slow response time the pricing was quite reasonable for what we got and the atmosphere was kind of fun i definitely would come back again on horseback
  get the california burrito i m from california and the burritos don t taste nearly as good as the burrito shack s
  came here for brunch with a friend i didn t have a negative experience at all just thought the frittata and egg sandwich were ok nothing to get excited about the bacon date scone was delicious the coffee wasn t hot enough but other than that no complaints loved the live jazz and the service was good too i would definitely go back i would love to see them do bottomless mimosas and bloody s but they don t that would be my one suggestion
  had a great time here last night despite there being no valet for some reason anyway this is a great place to bring out of towners it has a chic southwest feel while remaining upscale and impressive the spicy shrimp appetizer was perfect salad was crisp and fresh my chicken was succulent and a guest had the big ass burger which is a roaring fork tradition highly recommend this to people visiting the scottsdale area avoid the patio in the summer when you book your reservations three of us paid about 100 total for dinner with 1 drink each
  food and service is awesome make sure you eat desert too if you are lucky enough for hot turkish tea don t miss it i would recommend for anybody who wants to try mediterranean food
  i was really looking forward to this buffet only one we went to on our week long vacation i was disappointed all the things i heard were great it was mediocre 31 dollars a person if this is the best buffet in vegas i won t be eating at any other buffets in vegas i hate to right a bad review
  well what can i say wow this was the worst restaurant experience that i have had in my 43 years on this earth i am not exaggerating it was very very painful it started with the hostess a 5 10 minute wait was all she said 25 minutes later we discovered that she had mistakenly crossed out our names ok no problem mistakes happen we understand she says we get the next 2 person table cool as we are waiting i notice a couple being seated that came in much after us after some questioning she allegedly crossed out their names too umm really the girl had no clue finally got seated and the waitress tells us the kitchen is backed up and to be patient ok we are patient we order our food a spicy chicken sandich and a tuna sandwich as we are waiting and waiting and waiting we hear the waitress scolding customers i told you if you didn t order right away it would take longer you chose to wait really at another table she says the same thing the table next to us once they get their food complain and leave without even touching it oh my apparently the kitchen is small and can t handle a crowd the 2 sandwiches mentioned above took 70 minutes to get to us yes 70 minutes i can t believe we waited that long we were so mad but at some point we were too invested once the food comes no chips they will be along in a bit but they were not ready yet really the food was decent no complaints there every single table though was mad and upset about the wait it was the worst experience i have ever had at a restaurant and i eat out a lot anyway stay away from this place they don t deserve your business this by the way is also the first bad review i have ever written they should be ashamed
  i had the harami miso and the shrimp garlic bbq sooooooo delicious great service great food great price highly recommended
  this past saturday i had a grandiose plan of drowning my sorrows in high brow fried foods so my husband and i headed to the pub chip shop did i say that right any who we placed our order i got the special which was general tsos chicken fingers i also ordered the bacon cheese boxty tots i don t remember what my husband ordered because i was so goddam hungry i didn t really care what he ordered we were the only two customers at the time and it was taking a really long time for our food there were two guys in the kitchen and they were chatting it up with each other and another guy who i think just stopped in i think we waited for 25 minutes i was ready to go bitch ass crazy at this point then our food came the general tsos chicken fingers were un fricken believable i mean chicken fingers are usually a crowd pleaser but these were on another level crispy breading juicy white meat perfectly fried the dipping sauce was sweet and flavorful and the tots which i ve had before were a great guilty pleasure as usual the food was so good i forgot and didn t care how long it took to get in my belly this isn t a place my waistline can afford to indulge on the regular but every once in a while mmmmmmm good
  try the tallarin saltado for a delicious vegan meal it s amazing and never disappoints
  this place is a hidden little gem in henderson when i lived on this side of town we would go here exclusively for the gyro s the sauce they put on it is amazing also the fries with the garlic sauce is a favorite of my boyfriends this is a mom and pop kind of place and you are served by their family as for the other food on the menu i ve never tried any of it whenever we go to another greek place we always talk about the greek bistro and how we wish we lived closer to it
  hot shrimp was awesome
  authentic punjabi food and great service the spice level is a bit toned down i ordered a 10 highest and got what i would call medium hot but they got me a bowl of green chillies so it was all good try this place for sure btw i ordered the non veg thali i m modifying the review because the last time i was here the food sucked the service was still great and they switched out a dish for us but the overall food quality was lacking i m guessing only the thalis here are good as a person in our group ordered one of those and it was good
  i want to give the place five stars but i can not being that i didnt eat a burger here and i found a hair in my cesar salad when i was finished eating it the service was great my friend ordered her burger and asked for no pickle so i asked the server if i could have her pickle and she said sure and brought me like four more pickles that was awesome cuz that meal i was totally feeling veges not meat the cesar salad was pretty good too i like their croutons two thinly crisp slices of bread way better than blocks of croutons next time in vegas i want to definitely try their burgers the vege burger looked pretty good and so did the kobe beef one
  eggs benedict with smoked salmon and fingerling potatoes yes please this place rocks my world each time i ve been here one of the best bloody mary s i ve had in the valley and i drink an obscene amount of bloody mary s the vibe in this restaurant is lofty and modern with a bit of local art and an old safe in the women s restroom there are nooks and crannies throughout the space featuring modern local art and graffiti yet the wooden ballasts and minimal design leave it feeling almost futuristic in design my favorite feature of the st francis restaurant is the table nestled into a class atrium beside lush leafy landscaping this place is a hit in my opinion with delicious coffee amazing cocktails superb food and inviting hip atmosphere
  they have the best bagels in this area i used to live super close and now live in phoenix but i still make the drive because the bagels are that good so much better than any chain bagel place
  can t get enough of the fajitas very yummy beers are always cold and on point your typical corporate restraunt chain get the same no matter where you go i always stop in when i m indecisive on what i want to eat so my fall back is chili s yum
  fulfills expectation of a diner the reuben sandwich was pretty good onions rings were a little lukewarm but the fries were very fresh hot and delicious for a small kitchen they really cranked out the food fast and the service was not bad
  my boyfriend and i learned of hob nobs cafe spirits on an episode of check please arizona after watching the show we added them to our running restaurant list to patron in the future last week we were due to be out and about running errands so after surveying our list decided to grab lunch at hob nobs omg am i soooooooooo glad we did we arrived during off hours approximately 1 30pm so the place was our own little private cafe but as soon as we entered the door we were greeted with great service and food recommendations i selected the 1 2 sandwich and soup option with the doc s choice on marble rye this choice turned out to be the best turkey sandwich i ve ever had doc s choice is not your run of the mill turkey sandwich however this lovely lunch or dinner dyno is stacked high with mesquite smoked turkey breast a chipotle aioli roasted red peppers pepperoncini smoked gouda aged white cheddar cheese tomato sweet onion served on a gourmet pretzel roll as a full sandwich or your choice of bread if doing a half er as i did in one word outstanding as we finished devouring our respective sandwiches my boyfriend had the chicken pesto which was also tasty but mine took the cake we made an agreement to return however many times necessary to try each sandwich available on the menu at least once hob nobs cafe spirits is definitely that good right out of the gate i absolutely love when that happens highly recommend and will keep posting as we continue our menu adventure
  i really struggle between 3 and 4 stars for this place went there as apparently this was one of those places you have to try in vegas the portions are a bit too huge i had a hot dog and maybe ate half of it a friend had a steak sandwich that also was like a footlong someone else had nachos that most def work best as an appetizer for a large group one person cant finish them it really is just wasteful but the food was good not omg fantastic good but good i would go again but split your meal with someone else unless you get something like a salad we did order the fried oreo sundae which was really good but i hoped for better chocolate sauce on this it tasted like something out of a jar but overall still good i think is a great place to stop in for dessert after walking the strip but not an actual meal if you have high hopes to try dessert here maybe stick to a couple of appetizers for the table and then get dessert
  the crinkle cut fries were on point today they were so fresh and hot yummy my del combo burrito was fine it s what i usually order there but it s nothing special really i had a coupon for 1 off so it s nice to save a little money too
  this is probably the only place to bother eating at on walnut street fresh artisanal pizza great tasting light textured gelato friendly servers and staff the pizza fantastic it will take time for the to make it and it is not any damned pizza hut where they stuff you full of dough the veggies are fresh the cheese like velvet and dough complements all the textures i actually got accustomed to not being full just for the flavor and refreshing nature of a meal here some issues i have are with the setup of the restaurant itself it is hard to tell where to sit stand for pizza or gelato i walk in and am not sure who to talk to or where to go grab a server go to the register just sit down maybe a hanging sign above where you should go for what you wish to buy would help though that would totally destroy the decor i know it may just be too small a place given its popularity it can get crowded and loud with all the traffic the gelato brings large families kids etc this is kind of cool but can detract from the dining experience if you are unprepared if the staff seem harried or aloof it is more because of the bougie restaurant goers that are denizens of the area than the staff not caring about customers at least that is my opinion of all my experiences there the menu is one page and it may help if there was some general categorizations of the pizzas there the list is flat but since i try to be veggie it would be nice if there was some breakdown on the pizza types based on general toppings
  i actually liked it quite a bit i had the chicken crunch for appetizer only 4 pieces not really worth 10 and a full rack of ribs for entree it was huge i ended up forcing down the entire thing because i was going to a show after and i didn t want to carry around a doggy bag i wish there was an option for only a half rack just expect to either share or take home half fries were good too and there s tons of specialty drinks named after movies if you re into that sort of thing
  lux has some of the best espresso i have ever had the opportunity to slurp however i m sucker for the hip atmosphere and good indie music what i m saying is even if the coffee was not top notch i would probably still visit i know people make fun of hipsters who sit around on their laptops and write wrist slashing poetry but there is just something about the atmosphere here that helps me think a bit clearer like i said earlier this isn t just a hip place to sit the coffee here is splendid and the froth designs on the top are always a welcome addition to my the rich coffee goodness it is expensive so i don t go everyday like some of lux s more affluent customers but luckily lux sells their espresso for me to take home and brew myself after i brew a couple shots i sit at my dining room table blast some indie music put on my black framed glasses read a chuck palahniuk book and think about how cool i am
  oh blt i wish i could have given you more stars while seeking refuge from the sub freezing temperatures outside your red friendly glow attracted me faster than a coked out stripper stripper to a wad of cash i have no qualms with the staff they were friendly attentive and kept my tiny water glass filled to the brim yet the burger i ordered was a sad salty brick that would have made the cow cry we re talking basics here meat lettuce tomato onion bun how difficult is it to make sure my meat is tender seasoned and juicy had i been less inebriated i probably would have sent it back and ordered something less brick like but at this point im sure any food at all would have been a good idea to calm my tequila fueled intestinal pyrotechnics at least i had the milkshake to hold me over baileys coffee ice cream chocolate sauce and whoppers now that s something to write home about
  very good restaurant in the bellagio the food was quite tasty and the decor was simple but nice the service was somewhat disappointing as we had to ask our server for the pre theater menu that they promote outside and on the website the other servers were promoting this menu but not ours i guess because it was cheaper than the other prix fixe menu being offered
  this place is gloriousness on a plate and a coffee cup i stumbled on lazy jane s one summer biking around the lake and now come back everytime i am in town everyone here is amazingly friendly always offering free food to first time customers i havent ever had anything besides the egg and vegetable omelette because i dont want to mess with a good thing but friends have raved about the homemade granola and other bakery items this place is always really busy and there isnt a lot of seating so you will need to wait on the weekend but while you are you can look at the art from local artists that is displayed and for sale and wait for your name to be screamed in a welcoming way by the cook knowing that your food is ready this place is good stuff
  the prices are right for the food they serve i love the decor and their drink menu is good lives up to be a good little asian diner overall it s new business so hopefully they improve i would get everything besides the ramen doesn t really taste like ramen because the noodles aren t ramen noodles and the soup is just full of seasoning instead of actual broth thoughts on improvement 1 a sign by the sidewalk you can miss the entrance to the parking lot very easily at night 2 probably could use a waitress to see if the customers need anything there was one person doing everything from orders bringing out food to basically everything
  it was edible i didn t enjoy my meal i ve had much better chinese takeaways it was more expensive than the usual takeaway i go to the szechuan king prawn was terrible they had added weird flavours that made it floral and unpleasant the egg fried rice was over done the veggie spring rolls were soggy and flat with a weird taste in the middle the chips were good the prawn crackers were dry the bottom line is i will not return to so good chinese
  ok so maybe i m being harsh on my complaints but i had 2 1 fries they were good but not memorable kinda like 5 guys fries just mcdonalds size 2 sauce they r great amazing full of flavor well from the one sauce i got in a communion cup that if i dipped my pinky finger in to sample that would be all i had share the sauce they r very tasty now dinning area at lunch mind u was spotless food was fast and staff was amazingly friendly congrats pdq that s hard to accomplish chicken well is chicken but it s done very well and if every time i go i just have to ask for extra sauces then so be it great place for a quick quality sit eat and run lunch way to go pdq
  great place to stop in to have a bite to eat before a game or concert you will need to show up early though if there are special engagements going it gets packed fun place to be for a date night as well
  so there s no negative stars too bad tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it good thing you couldn t pay me to eat here the only thing about the colossal cobb salad i ordered was the price 10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings where d they get their chef chili s what a disappointment all the reviews say a lot of food for who an infant i had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well didn t know deep fried greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called cookies good grief the bakery wasn t even good had to spit those things out before they took out a filling the only good thing about chandler chompie s is jason s deli right next door
  west of new york city this is my favorite place to eat you ll wish you had more room in your stomach to try a bit more of jr s truly grand cuisine and accompanying libations eat a light lunch and be prepared for long meal that s worth the time it s in a full blown vegas style dining environment that showcases world class modern french fare enter through the mgm s villas and arrange to be driven in via one of their gold limos if it s your first time you can pay almost as much in napa sf la and other places in vegas but i still haven t found another establishment that has quite matched up french laundry is up there too of course but it s substantively different in style
  i ve been to this pace a few times the food isnt bad but i ve never had anything so good that i would order it again i got the pork porterhouse dinner the pork was over cooked not to tender it came with two patotoe pancakes they were really good i did have the white mango sangria to drink so good i had two this place is really cool inside because its in an old church lots of people take pictures when they walk in they get really busy here if you dont come earlier for dinner on weekend dont be surprised to have an hour wait
  after going back and trying the gv location a second time i feel they have upped their game better service all around now
  love this place very good customer service and food was great we always order baba ghanoush for appetizer its a small family restaurant and connected to a grocery owner is very friendly their hot tea also is good and a must try
  oh st francis you are the wind beneath my wings you truly are king of the world you complete me and yes yes indeed you had me at hello kitty sorry couldn t resist ate here last night with my folks and my visiting bro and his beau everything was absolutely outstanding with a shout out to our server and i m completely bummed i don t remember her name though i m happy to report my dad made a point to tell the manager how fabulous she was flatbread roasted chicken roasted veggies with goat cheese pork chop ribeye and the famous green chile pork stew i love you more than my luggage drink your juice shelby hit her weezer hit her go to st francis
  driving around we ask ourselves where can we get a good steak and not break the bank and we thought chili s in the past i ve had great ribeyes from this place but tonight it was a major fail the rib eye had no juice i even made a comment it seemed as if it was fake meat it also had this big blob of butter on it but it was a garlic butter that thru off the whole plate the whole thing tasted like the jar of garlic was old n turning ranced you ever buy a big jar of garlic from costco and you can t use it fast enough and its starts tasting funny exactly how dinner tasted major disappointment now i got offered a new steak after everyone was done eating and my dinner was already ruined chili s let me down as a faithful go to and lost a customer probably for a very long time
  my husband and i love to brunch at rachel s kitchen on the weekends not only did they expand and have tons of seating now but they also have an awesome outdoor seating area and live music on the weekends it is a great little hang out place in the spring and fall when the weather is perfect now on to the important stuff the blueberry pancakes are my personal favorite and they come with a side of fresh fruit my current addiction is the wilshire smoothie their smoothies are a bit runnier and more juice like than other places but they are still super tasty they also have a great regular breakfast of eggs toast potatoes and bacon the potatoes seem to be oven roasted and aren t greasy at all that s the thing i really love about rachel s kitchen everything is done with your health in mind i have only had lunch here once and my sandwich was nothing special the onion rings were delicious but there were only about 3 or 4 of them which was disappointing this is a great place to relax and enjoy a meal that you won t feel guilty about later so go grab a seat on the plaza and be serenaded while eating some delicious food
  great burgers shakes fries the choose your own toppings menu is like a scantron test it s a lot smaller inside than it looks outside but does have a separate bar area gotta come back and try their version of a juicy lucy minnesotan hamburger with cheese filling
  great food and a casual atmosphere the food is good i recommend the brisket nachos they are delicious there are lots of tv s and it is open to the hotel and casino floor great place to grub i have never had to wait for a table there
  the food is great but they really need to staff better for lunch 90 minutes is completely unacceptable
  i am always wanting to come back here my friends and i always come once a week to have there all you can eat sushi there specialty rolls are awsome i love spicy so any thing with spicy ahi is good they bring your food fast to must had reservatons when you come here
  i go to fast food places everyday of the week since i do not have kids i must go to long johns twice a year so this was tue 6 30pm i go to their drive thru and order a cod and shrimp basket from the ad that was up on their board they do not have it so i try and order an l1 which consists of fish and shrimp they inform me they do not have shrimp kinda like going to burger king and they do not have burgers or mcd and they cannot make me a number 1 big mac meal i understand they might be out of cod since it s their special but the sign was up and it wasnt even that late anyway i wont be back i should have read the other reviews before even wasting my time
  love this place always fun
  we re in town from winston salem for a show and made reservations here for brunch started with a bloody mary and sangria bloody was good a peppery the sangria was excellent a red sangria w berries really tasty the ms had waffles and i had crab cake w poached eggs both were fantastic ms said the waffle was the best she s ever had i think she was right my meal was excellent we had home fries that were perfectly seasoned to soak up the egg goodness great location for a show at blumenthal great brunch we ll be back for beauty and the beast in the fall
  i wasn t in a huge rush on my most recent trip through charlotte so i decided to grab some room at the bar and experiment with airport sushi i found myself quite impressed with the prices i was expecting to pay sky high prices clever pun yes i know but instead they were only standard expensive sushi prices i never had seaweed salad before trying it at this stand and it was astounding it s such a proud moment for mom and dad when baby first tries seaweed salad i was a little slimy but crunchy and flavorful i can t wait to get it again so i can compare also had a grand finale sushi roll it was avocado and fried shrimp wrapped in seaweed roll and rice and topped with crab meat and red black tobiku what the hell is tobiku it sounds better than it was but it still hit the spot covering my craving for deep sea delectables and uhm tobiku
  it depends on who you get to serve you make sure you ask not to be waited on by sweaty waiter it is so gross to watch the sweat drop off this guy he is so sweaty that he constantly has to push up his glasses one time i told the manager about him and told him he shouldn t be waiting tables the manager said his hands were tied because sweaty waiter was a friend of the owners family i told him that the waiter was disgustingly sweaty and he needed to towel off and have extra shirts the manager told me he does towel off and change shirts but it doesnt help then later he sent him home and told us he was sweating more than usual because he wasn t feeling well so gross
  i was a fan of their ube shake but they changed the formula the bf and i were excited to shop around while having a nice refresher but this was just very crunchy ice with a sweet milk that was colored purple no rich ube taste just sugar and when you drink the liquid it isn t completely meshed with the ice so you re just left with ice on the bottom what the hell was not worth the 2 99 each when it was a throw away don t get the shake drinks here the fast food may do in a pinch but their palabok wasn t even close to what it should be that i rather just skip it this is one of those places i feel is more the brand name than the quality i prefer red ribbon much better if i m seafood city
  i really don t like poutine but my daughter insisted on poutine for breakfast on our last day in montreal together we got there on a sunday morning right at 11am when they opened they were fast and friendly you do not come here for fine dining we ordered a large for 7 it comes in a round foil take out container whether you eat it there or take it to go it is very simple a mound of fries covered in gravy and plentiful cheese curd as poutine goes it was pretty good even if you don t like poutine
  i wish los taquitos existed in my town i visited this spot while on vacation on my next to last day and wish i had gone earlier so i could have eaten here multiple times this restaurant is located in a smallish strip mall it has a very casual atmosphere a walk up counter for ordering and a bunch of booths and tables to eat at there are colorful murals on the walls actually pretty cute the employees were friendly and helpful and my co eater and i both got a combo and a sope i would say the tacos were the best draw followed by the enchiladas then the tamales the rice and beans were tasty too the sauce on the enchilada and tamale was delicious i really wish i was able to try more this place is on my to do list for the next time i m in the area i hear they re putting a los taquitos outpost in phx airport how about one in new york next
  first off born and raised in texas for 2 decades i know and love some good tex mex i always go to macayo s to get my fix most recently i had an experience that i had to share the environment was welcoming and clean as always and we were seated quickly about 15 minutes after placing an order for my girlfriend and myself our waiter mark came back to let us know there was a problem in the kitchen and my queso would take a little longer than expected having just finished the first round of chips i was not displeased to know it would only be a short bit longer mark stayed very attentive toward the status of our order and kept us updated all throughout the order was then brought to me directly by the manager james who was very kind and apologetic i told him i truly didn t mind he was thankful but still insisted the wait was too long and would have preferably had my food out sooner it made me feel like my meal was actually being specifically cared for and might i add it came out absolutely delicious james later came back out and offered to buy us any dessert on the house as mark had heard us talking about the churros when we first sat down i was delighted to have such an awesome experience at a casual dinner great people great food practically made my week it was one of the best date nights my girlfriend and i have ever had thanks to mark james and everyone at macayo s 5 star restaurant service without thinning out your wallet
  first time at lucille s red rock great atmosphere great service the signature baby back ribs were perfect i ll be back
  how have i not yet reviewed bliss rebar i suck but bliss rebar doesn t i have spent many a happy drunken night here amazing patio food is great a drink specials you get 20 off your bill every wednesday night sometimes music is hit or miss friday night the dj was fantastic i would have stayed all night just to listen to the stuff he was playing i m a historic preservation advocate so i love the adaptive reuse of the houses the bar and restaurant are in i crave the eggplant sandwich and the pretzel bread with those delightful dipping sauces bottom line i m a fan and this is a solid neighborhood bar and restaurant
  i read a lot of reviews and knew this was a place to visit we first tried to visit it last saturday right when they opened at 6pm no reservation sorry no openings until after midnight wow i guess that makes sense since there are only about 10 tables in the entire joint i felt like a rejected girlfriend i needed to get in now but with two kids what are the chances that my babysitter and an opening at raku align low and behold it was tonight we made a reservation for 8 30pm after a networking event they were booked up but gave us the counter over the phone we arrived 30 minutes early hoping we could work our way in they sent us to the bar first the bar is just that a walnut natural wood bar but there was no bartender or booze there you just wait until it s time while propping your elbow up on the walnut luckily we didn t wait long otherwise the non bar bar would have made me mad plus we were seated at a real table not the counter usually i would prefer the counter a la sushi bar but this one was just a counter without action to watch i think the only main advantage to the counter is to socialize with other diners which i might add all seem to be really cool smart people a rare find for so many in one location in vegas we didn t know what to order but took a few recommendations from other yelp reviews i can t remember the intricate names of each but here s my layman s descriptions of our highlights hot asparagus with crunchy coating my favorite thing ever economical and awesome blue fin sashimi a pricey special at 25 but some of the best sashimi i ve ever had agedashi tofu it really is an amazing almost dessert like treat in a savory broth yellowtail skewers i usually think it is a shame to cook yellowtail but i didn t feel that way this time around butter scallop it was okay but not as special as the other items green tea creme brulee the bomb a great finish to the evening i thought all of these reviews were hype i m happy to say i was wrong every moment i spent dining at raku has made me a better person i will talk about this experience nonstop to my peers if you like japanese food you need to go here to make yourself a better person
  one of the best high end chinese restaurants in the valley
  i still love going to cacao70 but i think one thing i forgot to mention is the wait time i was lucky that i only waited 20 minutes to get a seat however i was only with my partner so if you have a bigger group it s definitely going to take a little longer you want to take that into account i believe the other locations e g around berri uqam isn t as packed but if you intend to meet here with a group of friends for say 9pm i recommend coming at least 15 minutes earlier this time i went my partner got a marshmallow and chocolate pizza while i got the choco nut waffle with ice cream we always see people ordering the pizza but i guess the idea never really sunk in to order one before definitely an interesting experience dough is basically pizza dough i was expecting pastry with roasted marshmallows and drizzled chocolate mmm so good but so filling i don t know how he finished it especially since it comes paired with fruits and another mini fondue of dark chocolate as for my order i loved the waffles as always i also love the nuts on top crunchy and sweet the cream and ice cream melted really fast and i m not exactly the fastest eater so my partner was taking bites here and there from my dish i am definitely loyal to the banana split waffle something about the caramelized sugar that seriously makes me drool i do love how they also gave me fruit and mini fondue though
  for dinner my friend expressed a desire for pasta so i decided to try out casa rugantino after doing some research online the family owned restaurant was small and charming now onto the food first of all the complimentary bread wasn t very good it tasted like the ones that i can buy at the grocery store and then warm up in my toaster oven lasagna layered with ricotta romano and mozzarella cheese ham and a meat sauce baked in the oven my friend commented that there weren t enough layers of pasta and i would agree with her the ham was also nowhere to be found nevertheless the flavours were authentic and delicious even though it wasn t the best lasagna that i ve had sacchetini alla gorgonzola cheese tiny shell like pasta stuffed with ricotta cheese tossed in melted gorgonzola cheese the pasta were really cute and reminded me of wontons stuffed with ricotta cheese which i love the sauce was absolutely scrumptious and perfectly cheesy but unfortunately it was also overly salty nevertheless we finished both of our pasta and enjoyed it wholeheartedly by the end of the meal we were pretty stuffed and couldn t get any desserts the pizza that i spotted from other tables looked awesome and i would definitely try one next time
  my husband and i decided to go here for brunch on a sunday morning of course it was busy but we were unimpressed isn t denny s supposed to be equipped for busy on a sunday morning we ordered an appetizer but it never came the reasoning it takes a long time to cook them our food was ok but it could have been better
  this place is so much fun to go to i am in love with the food here also the drinks lol though it can get crowded on the weekends and you may have to wait it s worth it there is always a great group of poeple that hang out here plus there is live music you can t beat that groovin to some tunes while enjoying awesome food i recommend soul as a definite go to
  excellent service came here for lunch on labor day there was no wait to be seated which was great the food is soooo good we ordered the aunt nina s mozzarella en carozza for an antipasto let me tell you that is a definite order again next time we go back my husband ordered the lisa v s linguine white clam sauce and i ordered the chicken parm the servings are big that i could not even finish one of the pieces of chicken parm after the app and of course saving room for the lobster tail for dessert that we shared between the both us because it is huge it is bigger than the ones you get at the bakery across the from restaurant everything we had was soooo good and can t wait until we go back in the future to try something different on the menu but this time it will be for dinner to have a bigger selection to choose from than the lunch menu
  the food and service was great you have to get there early because it is busy and fills up quickly there were people waiting outside before they opened despite the amount of people the waiters were very attentive and were always checking to see how we were not only that but all the waiters came and checked on us all the food that we had was great original bibimbap fried dumplings chicken karaage tteokbokki bulgogi and korean prime kolbi and easy to enjoy they had good music playing in the back ground that was not too loud and had a good mix of both korean pop music and american pop music an amazing find thanks fellow yelpers
  i think part of the reason for sone of the negative reviews are because people are expecting this restaurant to be on the same level as texas de brazil many people think brazilian food is just what they eat at these expensive restaurants without ever eating what people in brazil eat every day unfortunately i think this affects their reviews i lived in brazil for a few years and since returning to the us i have missed eating what i ate in peiples hones every day the coxinhas beans rice meats salads and even pasta dishes that i craved butbcould never find here in vegas someone told me about boca de brazil and i knew i had to visit im glad i did everything on the menu i have tried is absolutely amazing the coxinhas in particular are made the same way they are in brazil and are huge my in laws from europe had their pizza during a visit and they told me it was the best pizza they have had in the us i have always had superb customer service and the family that owns it are brazilian the mother recognizes me now when i come in and alwayd makes it a point to poke her head out of the kitchen to tell me hello i woukd recommend any of their dinner and lunch plates as well as their coxinhas and pastels again try the pizza especially with chicken and catipuri cheese you won t regret it i hear they are contemplating another location if it is on the east side of town i am going to get into some trouble
  decent bbq joint i had ribs both nights the best part and toughest desicion was which of the awesome glasses to drink out of i had the bong o and the toilet my only complaint was the inability to put a custom drink in my toilet cup overall this was the most consistently good place in circus circus of the places we ate over a 1 week trip
  this is our friday night dinner spot great food and great service we seem to always eat late with the kids when we go and there is never a wait we have not been let down once the entire menu is great dining room is cutoff from the bar so you wont choke on smoke and therefore makes it fine for kids
  love the location love the atmosphere loved eating at the bar where the guy to girl ratio was 4 1 defiantly aimed toward the younger crowd
  this place is excellent i go there at least once a week and each time i am surprised by some new food item that s great the food is always good great breakfast my favorite is the huevos rancheros the sandwiches and salads are great too the staff is always nice and attentive it is a great place for breakfast on a weekend morning or for a quick but good lunch during the week
  i wish i could star rate a restaurants food service ambiance etc as individual parts of the whole experience the ability to do this would drastically affect this review of nora s the food tonight was good not excellent but it had some high points gnocci w vodka sauce veal scallopinni however other items lacked flavor or in the case of the chicken parm fell apart all together the hostess and bar staff were great they handled the dinner crowd very well we had a drink while waiting for our table once it was ready we were promptly transferred to the dining room this is where things went down hill fast our server was waiting on my wife and i a party of 16 and 3 4 other tables we noticed she had a busser justin and 2 other food runners helping her with the party all this assistance should have freed her up to provide atleast a bit of competent service to our table and those around us in the hour and twenty minutes we were in the dining room we interacted with our waitress 4 times 1 placed order for 1st cocktails appetizers entrees 2 delivered 1st cocktails ordered waters 3 ordered 2nd cocktail because we hadn t recieved food 4 recieved check notice it wasn t our server who delivered our second drink or our food she didn t approach our table until we requested our check through the busser when she did approach the table she asked how everything was tasting there were no plates on the table because we has finished our dinner 10 minutes before my wife and i have no idea what she was doing the whole time we were there her large party seemed to be cared for mainly by support staff such as the food runners and the busser unfortunately i cannot rate the individual parts of this establishment separately so they receive 2 stars based on the dismal performance of our server and lackluster food however justin the busboy is a 5 star employee he never stopped moving he turned tables with absolute efficiency and was incredibly professional in dealing with the customers we observed him distributing plates and flatware to the large party everyone was handed items individually with an excuse me and thank you when he had to reach the opposite side of the table we laughed when we observed another employee simply walk up and place a handful of forks and a stack of plates at the end of the table and walk away just expecting the head of the table to pass them out fantastic job tonight justin we appreciated your effort
  super sweet family owners quality pho and spring rolls had a beef pho chicken pho and grilled pork bowl for me my wife and two young kids all was very tasty very casual so great for the kids owner made me a green mussel on the house which was very good as well opened very recently go check them out if you are in the area
  i loooved the wynn buffet i had done my research before coming to vegas and this buffet came highly recommended so my traveling companion and i went for breakfast on our last day the food was tasty and beautiful and i ate so much that you had to practically roll me out the door since lunch items were put out before we left we were able to sample those items as well which was an added bonus service was great our drinks were always refilled and plates cleared quickly the desserts were so pretty that i almost didn t want to eat them but then i had 3 plates so i got over that pretty quickly
  soho was suggested to me by a coworker who loves sushi and i had drove by it a few times so i was curious to find out how good it would be the food was amazing and the fish was of best quality and fresh i would give the food 5 stars i was expecting it be because the owner is chef john chien lee former executive chef of social house at aria the service wasn t the best at least for me with the wait staff and i expand on why later on first the food we ordered baked mussels seaweed salad the spicy tuna roll the salmon and avocado roll and the salmon wasabi creme the dish i was excited to try the most the appetizers tasted the same as they would any other japanese restaurant nothing special i love salmon and it was definitely on point in both the wasabi creme and paired with avocado in a roll the spicy wasabi creme had a nice hint of lemon tangy to compliment the fish but the wasabi creme could of had a little more punch to it in the roll the avocado was nice and creamy and it looked like more of a mash than just a big chunk which was very appreciated mid meal the chef and owner john chien lee came out to check on everyone dining and when he can by our table he was friendly and welcoming he saw that i had a thing for salmon and asked if i would mind to try something similar but not salmon compliments of the chef and i said sure he brought us out the house special ocean trout and it was just what he said delicious i never knew trout could taste as good as salmon and i enjoyed the surprise of the pop rocks that had top it off the service would get a rating of 3 stars it wasn t till the chef talked to us that the waiters had a bit more urgency to serve us which was just two people it wasn t too busy when we walked in but it took longer than usually for them to sit us when there were plenty of tables available and the waiter also forgot we were there after he had told us to wait a moment i think that the chef probably just got there a few minutes after we had sat because it seemed that every customer after us they were on it and asking if it was there first time and giving them dishes of the house which we did not receive though the chef made up for it with the complimentary dish of trout the ambiance of the place was okay it was like top 40 with house music playing similar to places like ra sushi minus the loudness decoration was okay could have been more but will do i did enjoy the menu and the way it was set up all in all if your looking for fresh fish at a great price with a chef who has experience from working at a well known sushi spot on the strip without the pricey cost this is definitely a spot to try happy hour runs mon sat the days they are open from 4p 6pm and even though the service was ehh the food was delicious and i ll definitely go back for more
  what is not to love about flo s i haven t eaten here in years and it was just as great as i remembered i am from new orleans and their shrimp rivals the fresh gulf shrimp that i grew up on i had the seafood soup and it was delicious and full of shrimp and scallops my meal was only 11 00 and i have leftovers for tomorrow night the hot and sour soup was also amazing and i hear their beef and noodle soup is delicious i am here for a month and will be eating here a lot i can t even make dinner at home for less than that
  service 2 i came here with a couple of friends right when the restaurant was opening up for lunch and there was only one server available it took almost half an hour for the waiter to take our order and then another 45 minutes to receive our food food 3 food was average ordered the angus burger with chipotle aioli the burgers come plain cheese dressing and extras are considered additional toppings personally i d much rather have a burger from in n out the ahi tuna tacos were delicious but way too small like two bites small
  if you like duis or like people driving out on the street wasted without being cut off by a bartender then this is the place for you they will serve you to the point that you can barely walk and then watch you drive off into the sunset but dont worry the customer service doesnt end there your bartender will even send you a cute little text message because she knows you are beyond wasted just to make sure you got home okay lol if you have to send a customer a text message to make sure they got home okay then uummmmmmm hint maybe you shouldnt have served them so much and just maybe hopefully the liquor board will investigate this shaddy bar i use to bartend and in no way shape of form should anyone be allowed to drink as much as this bar does without cutting them off this bar is a danger to our roads
  i walked down here form the lvcc after a long day on the consumer electronics show floor and was pleasantly surprised the naan was tasty the navratan korma a little different than what i m used to but still quite yummy and the staff was attentive wait no the staff was attentive until i tried to pay my bill that bit was sort of weird they were there just enough to perfectly take care of me but not be over bearing until i tried to give them money one pint off for the long time i had to try to flag someone down to give them my debit card i d definitely visit again but next time may just pile some cash on the table and wander out un noticed when i m done
  this place is sexy woh this is a review of the downstairs loungey sexy area not the regular dining area is there a regular dining area huh don t remember seeing it anyway the small plates menu is divine like jesus i m not kidding the beef tenderloin toasts were as much of a religious experience as i ll allow myself to have the ahi tuna with wasabi salsa blush caused me to mush mouth the words ohhhh muhhh gawww while i was still chewing my food i don t do that ever it s just nasty the blue crab tostadas were light and refreshing the perfect compliment to the rich tenderloin the wine let s just say i like me some wine the only complaint i have is that the bartender needed a trim seriously his hipster do was getting in his line of vision and anytime we needed anything i had to flash him to get his attention okay not really but you get the point in closing this place will make you forget what you were fighting about trust me on that the end
  i m really conflicted about this place i expected so much and left with really dry steak pieces still stuck in my teeth we went for dinner at 9pm on july 4th and the place was half filled not a good sign our wait service was alright however we ordered goose fat fries which the waiter forgot or didn t hear my husband when he ordered it nevertheless we asked about it and it ended up coming during the last part of our meal now let me get to the steak we ended up sharing a 28 day dry aged rib eye on the advice of the waiter he said to order the steak medium with pink in the middle vs medium rare which he said would mean that the steak would still be dark pink and cool in the middle big mistake i don t exaggerate when i say that the steak was tough as cardboard and it had to literally saw through the steak to get a piece off also there is this extremely salty and peppery crust on the steak that added to the dryness to the steak also the goose fat potatoes were also very dry with a tough crust around it interesting enough that was also very salty the only saving grace is the truffle creamed spinach this dish is delicious my lasting memory of this place is salty tough steak that was stuck in my teeth on the way back to our hotel not pleasant
  i discovered this hidden gem while shopping at tj s and returned for happy hour between 4 and 6 30 from t f the patio is in the afternoon shade and far enough off scottsdale road to avoid street noise the seven tapas appetizers attracted my interest and i ended up selecting 1 ebi prawn with grilled fennel 2 tartine of bouillabaisse and 3 medjul dates with merguez sausage sugar cured bacon for the happy hour price of 3 for 10 vs the normal 3 for 15 the single prawn was large and equal in quality to the fresh prawns i had just tasted in new zealand plus the fennel added more flavor the tartine of bouillabaisse was mostly small shrimp but again very tasty and tempting to order a bowl the next time around the three medjul dates with sausage bacon was an unusual combination to my culinary experience and superb in flavor the select wines were about half the normal price and a definite value at 5 per glass in talking with the waiter i noticed there is live jazz on fridays between 5 and 8 i will definitely have to return on a friday to try the other tappas and listen to the swedish singer who sings some songs in german see tappas photo update 4 25 08 happy hour season ended this week tappas special no longer available but the thin crust pepperoni makes a good starter entrees are in the range
  after eating at many japanese restaurants in southern california i decided since i was going to vegas why not try one of the japanese restaurants on the strip so i landed at social house inside treasure island the look of the place was unique when you check in they escort you to the second level and while walking up there the walls resembled safety deposit boxes which i thought was artistic the service there was great the servers there were friendly and courteous but when they made recommendations i slightly started to laugh quietly they started to praise certain dishes that are unique but in reality anybody can whip it up at home now the food it was good but like i said it was not unique nor was it fresh i have eaten at kitayama in costa mesa matsuhisa in beverly hills and you can taste the freshness my buddy kept on praising the fish here saying it is as fresh as it can get i took a bite into the uni sake salmon and sashimi dishes they were good but not fresh for being high profiled japanese restaurant it seems like they concentrated more on the artistic looks of the food than the taste in my opinion there will never be a great japanese restaurant in vegas in order for that to happen california has to sink into the pacific and then vegas will have immediate access to the ocean to get fresh seafood even though seafood comes in fresh on a daily basis by air or truck the quality does go down from being refrigerated for a long period of time all in all the design of the restaurant is interesting the servers are polite and courteous but i would recommend another restaurant if you are picky on taste like i am
  i am so glad to have found this place on yelp there is a lack of quality food options near my home so i m glad that i stopped in to try something in my backyard instead of driving across the valley like i mostly have to do i tried a greek salad 4 5 5 lamb and beef gyro 5 5 seasoned fries 5 5 and a walnut baklava 5 5 i thought with all this food i should stretch it in to two meals but it was so good i ended up eating it all in one sitting my stomach is a bit peeved at me but man am i content i liked that the salad included a dolmades i knocked a bit off my salad rating as it had a bit too much dressing i may ask for it on the side next time also i didn t care for the pita flat bread with seasoning inside otherwise i really enjoyed the salad the fries were just perfect and i loved the seasoning the main attraction my gyro was without a doubt one of the best i ve had the meat was plentiful and perfectly seasoned i liked the little touch of sauce included one last note the owners were very kind it is a breath of fresh air when an owner takes pride in their work and makes you feel welcome most places in my area treat you like a bother or just ignore you so top marks to a place where they greet you and make your day just by going the extra mile
  this used to be my favorite chinese restaurant near downtown now they raised their prices and are charging for bland fried rice for lunch and the soup looks like a bowl of snot i will not be back
  this is the other restaurant in lee lee i don t know if it s korean vietnamese or what they have sushi banh mi boba tea and a cooler case full of kim chee it s more of a casual grab and go type establishment than hope kee i can t say anything about the quality of their food but i did grab a thai iced boba tea yes two awesome things combined in one drink not only that it was really good the lady who made it was so proud of the quality of their boba teas she insisted that i take a sip before i even left her counter then i sucked down the rest before i even got to the end of the block it was so worth the belly ache
  i have been to the marriott for gaming and recently discovered this quaint bar the happy hour is great i met the bartender courtney who was very helpful in picking out a drink also she was very knowledgable about the entire casino such a friendly environment really enjoyed our night
  we like this place cuz it s down the street from my fam s house and they have a party like atmosphere nice bar with some tvs to watch the game the food is decent the portions are huge and the service is excellent
  decent but not great pizza wasn t spectacular but it was different and the atmosphere was all right i would consider watching sports there next time over steiners or roadrunner lots of tvs but i would be concerned they only watch detroit
  with an upset stomach but in need of some dinner i decided some plain old noodles may be exactly what i needed over past the chick fil a and next to flying biscuit at 5 30 it was already starting to fill with families the restaurant is loud even at first arrival when there was hardly anyone there there is a higher noise level than it would appear but since i don t have children i am more aware of noise than other folks who have been deafened by the incessant rumble of crumb snatchers may not notice you stand in line to order and are given your drink cup s and a number to put at your table when your order is ready the fast wait staff whisk it to your table everyone employed there that i encountered was smiling friendly and helpful i ordered the 3 cheese macaroni 6 with a soft drink 1 79 and cotton candy 1 as another reviewer stated the 3 cheese mac was pretty meh the sauce could be thicker as it really just seemed like pasta water with some cheese residue in it but it was fine and it arrived to the table smoking hot the bread stick served with the pasta was delicious i could have eaten a 5 lb sack full of just their breadsticks sodas were self serve with coke products and teas and the cotton candy as silly as this sounds was the highlight of the meal it s hard to find cotton candy and for whatever reason this absolutely hit the spot as i sat at the table delighting in the blue spun sugar it was fine i would go again when feeling better to try something else a woman sitting near me had a pasta dish with some tomatoes and something green that looked quite good dinner was less than 10 and i left fat full and happy so it s all good
  on a recent vacation my man and i took a trip down to the ol oyster house so he could reminisce about his bachelor days in sunny az i guess this was the cool spot when he was growing up literally the only cool spot nothing like self consciously hipsterized bar lined alterna culture seattle where we live now this was a lot of fun for me 1 i have never seen so many different kinds of bar flies in one place in seattle having 10 million bars means that each one can serve its own perfectly isolated niche e g bearded heavy metal knitting enthusiasts i guess living in a town that mainly has tumbleweeds and meth to offer means that on friday night everybody looking to party ends up in the same place soccer moms goths really still bros and yes hipsters all gettin wasty in their own corner of this sprawling bar 2 property is pretty cheap in az i guess this place is huge that was fun 3 mmmmm i ate the hummus and pita it was delicious 4 i can t believe how absurdly freaking cheap it is to drink in this town god why d i ever move to the pacific northwest i shoulda moved to tempe oh wait this would be the only place i d ever go
  a friend suggested we meet at osaka japanese bistro my first time there they really need to work on the menu situation it is just not working i had a couple of rolls the lisa lisa and the california tempura they were good at the monday happy hour pricing and the house salad was tasty my friend had the white tuna sashimi which she said she liked the place has a nice ambiance our server was jeremy and this kid was very good polite attentive and checked on us regularly there was a problem with the bill but it was taking care of they overcharged me i have been to a few sushi places in vegas with many more to go this is a nice place but not at the top of the heep decent experience probably the better in this area of town until i expand my experience go for the happy hour until the next time
  the location is great the room rates are great for what you get the service is awful aren t the hooters girls supposed to be nice to customers the only good service was in the restaurant and it wasn t even the hooters restaurant
  a girl friend and i went here on a wed night which we found out was one of the best nights to go women get 50 off all drinks after 8 the food was decent we ordered the cheese plate and bruschettathe vibe here was hopping the men were on the older side along with the music being a 28 year old single gal i knew i wouldn t be meeting anyone i was interested in that night overall it was a good night i would definitely go here again
  very good place the sushi rolled were good and the service was excellent would go again
  i got the shepherd s pie and my friend got the bangers mash the shepherd s pie uses chuck roast i believe so it has nice chunks of beef you get quite a bit of food for the price the waitstaff was nice and they had a great selection of beer this location is a lot less busy than the one on the capitol square so if you don t want to wait this is a good choice the menus are a little different at the different locations
  just went here last night for dinner whoa we were impressed we made the reservations based on yelp reviews and the descriptor of peruvian cuisine and had no idea what to expect what we found was deliberate well made and moderately proportioned dishes that left us satisfied we ll be back for sure the lomo inka heritage was delicious
  what can i say that hasn t already been said this is an awesome diamond in the rough and worth the trip every time in fact just the mere thought has me drooling and thinking of making a trip there i have been to both locations this one and the one out in mesa although the one is mesa is closer to my house and the food the same quality i prefer the ambiance of this one better so my husband and i always try to stop by when in the area i l admit i m not very adventurous when eating new things at times i find a favorite and stick to it i have tried about 5 different pasties but my favorites i always come back to are the oggie and chicken pot pie their soups are also wonderful the potato leek is very hearty and filling but the mushroom walnut and spinach was a wonderful surprise i would never have tried it because it seemed and odd mix of flavors but i saw an episode of check please az where this soup was raved about so i decided to give it a try i am so glad i did the complexity of flavors was out of this world a huge beer and a warm pasty the casual atmosphere and aroma of the mouth watering red wine gravy all blend into a wonderful dining experience for the value and the quality this is a must try for everyone
  great food great service sommer was awesome and very attentive described the menu in detail and was very accommodating the food itself was top notch the kobe beef burger was cooked perfectly and the rosemary fries weren t overbearing at all perfect seasoned the pizza i got was by the slice up front the picantes favors melded perfectly together take a bite of the chorizo and the ricotta at the same time crazy result the pizza of the day was sausage and pepperoni can t go wrong with that music was good and provided a rock style atmosphere can t wait to come back
  i went there for sunday brunch for the first time and it s a nice place there were only about 4 brunch entrees available on the rotating menu and only 1 jumped out at me as sounding undeniably delicious i played it safe with eggs bacon and potatoes they didn t even have an omelette which was very surprising and a bit disappointing let me say though the bacon was cooked to perfection lots of taste and not too crispy potatoes were surprisingly tasty and the eggs were eggs service was impeccable there are few places that keep up with how much water i drink i thought for such a basic dish it was a little pricey at 10 but i must admit that it was really well done so my three star comes down to flavor service bacon powdered popcorn price selection
  amazing i live downtown and this sushi place is close n convient the food was great and the staff super friendly i find the pricing is not too bad and the food is awesome i tried some things that were recommended and i was not disappointed i have only been once but guarantee i will be back
  this has to be one of the best seafood buffets in las vegas you can eat unlimited king crab legs slipper lobsters sushi and prime rib be sure to get there early or gamble enough so you can go in the vip line the line can get long but definately worth the wait
  went in w my birthday email for free pizza waiter was great just had iced tea soda pizza was delicious as usual left tip as if bill had 16 pizza incl dont want to short change staff
  90 seconds to delicious i love that i can eat this pizza without needing tons of napkins and feeling the constant need to wipe grease from my mouth the wood fire crust is a delight great place to go when you re in a hurry if you call ahead the quoted time might be like mine tonight a quick 5 minutes i have deducted a star because the toppings can be scarce i m not looking for loaded but i m looking for a taste of each ingredient in each bite
  one of my go to places for takeout for a quick dinner when i am not in the mood to cook the flavor is always good and consistent and the size of the big bowls are great i always have leftovers for my lunch the next day i love the large beef bowl with veggies i also love to add the crushed peppers and a little bit of soy sauce my boyfriend likes the mixed bowl so he gets the chicken beef and mixed veggies on a very hungry day we will add the gyoza none of this is gourmet it is a fast food place but for a filling good flavored dinner it is perfect the staff is always friendly and fast with the service and the food this will continue to be a great fast take out dinner place for me
  the margherita pizza at la piazza al forno is delicious the atmosphere is welcoming and reminds me of pizzerias all across naples a gem in the west valley steffano is a gracious host and quite hospitable will definitely visit this restaurant in the future
  i have no idea how this place is rated over 2 stars much less 4 the place is clean and it s nestled in a little shopping center next to a thai massage place so i was ready to be impressed thai is my favorite food so i m always looking for new spots one of my favorite spots in vegas is le thai and there are some other noteworthy places as well since we planned a day at the aquatic center we stopped here for a quick lunch we was me my mom 2 year daughter and 5 year old niece the egg rolls were awesome for our entrees we ordered yellow curry and chicken house noodles the yellow curry was gross and i ve been to thailand had tons of curry in the past the noodles were over cooked and looked like throw up on a plate we told the waitress she could take the plate and toss it she never offered to let us order something else the kicker was when we went to claim the two free egg roll yelp coupon she didn t deduct it from our tab and told us we should have told her when we sat down that we planned to use it wtf so between the crap food and service we didn t even bother leaving a tip so i guess that saved us about 6 7 on a meal that was already 30 and it covered our egg rolls overpriced overhyped bland and bad service do yourself a favor and skip this one there s way better thai in las vegas this was below average and unappetizing and that s being modest will never return p s the kids wouldn t even touch the noodles and they love noodles that tells you something my 2 year old daughter filled up on plain white rice and my niece on the vegetarian egg rolls yelp doesn t usually fail me but today was an epic fail
  we are huge fans of the original hash house in san diego 4 5 stars with an amazing food experience plus outstanding service i honestly tried to love this place but they fall way short of the original although service was great the quality of the food can t be compared to the san diego location we came here twice in 2 days hoping that the first day was just a bad day both times our food came unexpectedly quick within 5 7 min and tasted pre cooked the 5 stuffed burger was just okay the hamburger meat was fast food quality and tasted bland for 15 i expect good quality meat and great flavors the day before i ordered the corned beef hash again the food tasted like it was precooked and warmed to order highly disappointed way too much cheese and i love cheese the breakfast biscuit was super hard if you re looking for quantity with mediocre quality this place is for you the price of the plates and the overall quality of the food do not make sense in my book
  great korean place off the beaten path in las vegas certainly a place to come back next time when in las vegas
  very awesome atmosphere the outside yard area is great couches with firepit tables they have ping pong shuffle board bean bag toss for your entertainment there is staff helping all the time the bar runs slow but great drinks food was great
  this place is awesome had lunch there yesterday so happy it s 5 min away from my house great food if you have been to laibela it s comparable had the veggie meat combo it s huge could feed 3 go check it out
  second time to bld and so disappointed the short rib breakfast burrito was dry and tasteless and the avacodo was missing in action my friend s chicken fried steak was greasy and gloppy and tough she could barely cut her steak and the potatoes were cold service was indifferent as in our waiter couldn t have cared less about us he was absent for much of the time we were there hey how about some water what a difference from the last time we were here can t rave today
  overpriced and everything takes 20 30 minutes to arrive at your table only good thing i d say is that they kept our water glasses filled all night which was not even our waiter the other reviews are pretty spot on nice patio but not worth coming back with all the other options around
  no free refills on soda rude employees who doesnt have free refills on soda sandwich meat dry unremarkable many other choices nearby will stick to those
  first time here and donna brought us some warm delicious banana nut muffins as a welcome best i have ever had then had a great omlete made the way we needed it because we are on a diet looking at other tables it all looked delicious donna thanks for being such a great server will come back when we come back to vegas
  my new favorite italian joint they had some minor problems when we went for lunch the air conditioning was on the fritz and the entrees didn t all come out at the same time but the food service was awesome i felt like i was in italy which was impressive considering i was on the west side next to a circle k i ordered the veal cannelloni 8 95 by the way everything is 8 95 for lunch the portion size was perfect the pasta and ingredients all tasted very fresh delicious the focaccia bread we started with was also homemade and very yummy the other guys i went with ordered the pizza with sausage and broccoli and said it was awesome sadly i didn t have enough room in my stomach having devoured my entire meal but i will definitely try that next time no liquor license yet
  lane s appeared to be more of a neighborhood stop than i previously expected they have a wide variety of traditional donuts more unique donuts cookies and other dessert pastries i was mainly here for the donuts so i opted to try a traditional glazed a buttercream filled chocolate glazed and a persian style cinnamon roll less sweet with peanuts on top instead of sugar and frosting none of them really blew me away but they weren t overly sweet so i didn t dislike them overall it s an ok but pricey donut shop i will probably stick to greenbush for my sugar fix
  best indian cuisine in phoenix hubert is a great host funny and kind i gotta say it though rakesh is missed hope to see him around
  my husband and i had been meaning to try this place since it opened a while back but we only ever remembered when we saw it as we pulled up to get our take out from li s bowl next door lol finally the other day we managed to remember we wanted to try it it was decent we both got the fried fish with fries and mac and cheese it was more expensive than i d thought it would be 10 for the entree without a soda the servings were huge though so that made up for the price personally i d rather have had a bit less food at a cheaper price since it was far too much for either of us to finish the fries were pretty tasty the mac and cheese was very bland the fish itself tasted good but they put too much seasoning on the outside and in their batter for my tastes my husband thought the seasoning was pretty good the tartar sauce tasted more like coleslaw to me and i hate coleslaw all in all i d say it s worth a try
  i agree with michelle k s review who s mia this used to be just za s 02 05 the menu used to be simple b w and now it s all technicolored and double sided they had plenty of options before but now it s just overwhelming i found myself hovering over the counter for way too long to fill out the order sheet and afterwards i wasn t sure if i d missed anything but yes the food is about the same it still tastes like dorm pasta but good dorm pasta although the garlic bread isn t as tasty as before hmmm
  i had ganadara sauced fried chicken fried rice cake and while the food and service was o k the price was a bit high
  the waitress was so sweet super friendly and as accurate as she could get i ordered the veggie burger and my daughter the bacon cheese burger both were cooked to perfection the fries are bottomless can t beat that the onion rings were delicious especially when smothered in their ranch dressing the vegetables were crisp and ripe and the buns were perfectly soft our drinks were always filled and service was fast our waitress was a total sweetheart she noticed my daughters keropi watch from mcdonalds and told us of how many her daughter had collected we told her we had just visited 3 different mcdonald s locations in search of that hello kitty watch and we had no luck she immediately went to the back room and came back with an unopened hello kitty watch and offered it to us i was amazed i hugged and thanked her she reminded me that there still are giving people in the world
  dpov is a great place for celebratory dinners and such and it isn t cheap but in my opinion it is very much worth every penny the view is breathtaking and i love the floor to ceiling windows the host servers are very professional friendly and not over bearing the crowd is very diverse but mostly older 30 when dining here i was the youngest one and everyone was having wine whereas i was having a cocktail i felt young but my cocktail was nice and sweet i had a three course meal which consisted of appetizer grilled pancetta wrapped shrimp main course coffee brown sugar seared pork tenderloin dessert chocolate hazelnut brown butter brownie each dish was prepared brilliantly and the presentation was exquisite i was very much in love with my main course the coffee brown sugar pork tenderloin i don t drink a whole lot of coffee so i was kind of iffy in having my pork tenderloin coated with it but i was surprised it was so good also the restaurant allows you to go out to the patio and take photos or just take in the magnificent view
  this place was a hidden gem friendly staff and good food
  mother bunch brewery is a awesome addition to the downtown neighborhood i had a duck pastrami sandwich heaven is not too far away the meat was flavor able and tender it was served on marble rye bread which was the best marble rye bread i ever had i also had a spinach and fennel salad the salad was very fresh and crispy i had a beer flight which was inexpensive and a good way to try the beers they serve beers from dragoon brewery which is in tucson their beers are so yummy
  a very good place to relax people watch enjoy some live music and converse with friends nothing here was so overwhelming as to fray from our good time which now in my thirties is actually a good thing the chimay on tap is a bonus and the staff is very friendly thanks rob who happens to be a friend good acoustic guitar playing and a lively atmosphere the crowd swelled in at around 10 15 pm as we were wondering if we were the only ones in the place for the first thirty minutes i have yet to try the food but they had very good selections as witnessed by our table neighbors i would go back especially for that chimay
  huh so i ve never reviewed the roo well now seems a good time helpful hint first friday is not a good night to check out the roo for the first time thankfully i ve been here a few times before last night so the cramped sweatiness didn t sway my opinion this is probably my favorite house bar of the area i love lost leaf but i think the roo gets a slight nod because of the beers on tap lots of great microbrews vs bottles cans at ll also lots of great microbrews my advice is to check this place out on an off night or get there early on a weekend night or else you ll be standing the whole time
  had lunch there today love the gilbert which is the homemade chicken salad fun and super friendly will always go back
  so good probably the closest thing you ll find to a true east coast pizza pie in the madison area a thinner crust but not too thin and soft so you can fold it yes fold it like a new yorker but not a new york pie new jersey a trenton style pie with the cheese on the bottom and sauce on top never understood that concept until i ate at sal s but it works and the swirl of sauce on top looks pretty to boot one of the very few pizza places in the area to offer a form of an authentic and traditional pizza if you ever want to prove to someone from out of town that pizza can be done correctly in the madison area order sal s
  ordered take out for first time right before closing it was really fresh and delicious i ordered the wonton soup and spicy noodle with tomatoes loved it will definitely be ordering again highly recommend
  we rarely give less than 4 stars since we usually frequent 4 star and up yelp reviewed restaurants the service here was great the establishment was clean the food was sub par the toast was cold their menu selections were minimal and the omelette was flat and not fluffy my wife thought her potatoes were over cooked this place isn t awful and would rate at about the same level as a denny s if you want a fantastic breakfast try any us egg https useggrestaurant com
  was really torn about what rating to give e by jose andres but ultimately i had to decide 5 stars b c the entire experience was pretty amazing the food is definitely delicious though and credit definitely goes to the chefs for executing such creative dishes special standouts to me were the fried chicken skin oyster and iberico pork dishes i even tried uni and caviar for the first time while i enjoyed both and im glad i tried both i hate to say it but i dont think i have a palate for fancy food like that haha i really recommend getting the alcoholic pairings for additional 110 per person i think i got 9 or so drinks with the pairing in addition to the already included alcohol dishes on the menu the customer service at e is what really impressed me though from start to finish it was an awesome experience after initially sending in my reservation email i received a response sent back my form and got my confirmation back within 48 hours got my golden tix a few days before my dinner and i was ready to go upon my arrival to jaleo we were escorted to our dining room and the e team is so wonderful friendly helpful and accommodating even though the meal is 160 ish a person the staff didnt make it feel stuffy at all it was a very casual relaxed atmosphere and they encouraged us to ask questions and conversate amongst ourselves stephanie mia lisa alfie sp thank you so much for a wonderful time i learned so much tried so many new food drinks and had an amazing birthday dinner is truly a once in a lifetime experience especially since i don t think justin b s credit card liked that dinner total haha
  in town for spring training and decided to try this place out we took our food to go because we had to get back to the hotel things that were good customer service the bartender that took our order was very helpful in answering the questions we had about menu items things that were bad the wings they were very typical wings the wings themselves were ok there was very little seasoning on them we got an order of buffalo ranch boneless the ranch flavor that i could taste was from the ranch dressing i dipped them in the order of chili pepper hot was hot whenever i ate a piece that actually had sauce on it the order of ancho chili lime were the same as the buffalo ranch the name i don t get it i haven t looked in to their story but they had a cubs cardinals bears packers and yankee sign on the wall there was a picture of nyc on the wall to and we think there s a new york connection to the name overall i would have rather gone to the national wing chain restaurant even though i really hate that place
  this is one the best breakfast spots in town because of this you can expect a wait time of 20 30 minutes every day the place is small but has plenty of solid food options to choose from i tried the loco moco breakfast which was scrambled eggs white rice a hamburger patty and delicious brown gravy over the top i also chose to replace the macaroni salad with hash browns my wife ordered the biscuits and gravy with seasoned potatoes her plate arrived with 3 massive biscuits and a white gravy that had bits of sausage throughout we topped off our order with a short stack of their red velvet pancakes wow these are great however a little too sweet for me to eat as an entire breakfast my 3 year old son could not stop talking about these red pancakes and even wanted them for dinner that same day service is efficient and the staff is friendly our bill came out to 28 00 not including tip
  great burger clean restraunt friendly staff during a super busy time and the manager even introduced himself and attended to us a
  we had the lasagna and a plate of pasta the lasagna was okay tasted as if it was from a frozen dinner as for the pasta the pasta was a bit too hard and the sauce was okay way too expensive for the not so great taste quality of the food the only good thing about this place is the fountain and the atmosphere the servers were okay i felt like they judged the four of us just because we ordered two entrees honestly we were not super hungry and just wanted a bite to eat maybe next time we should have been smarter and went for earl of sandwich or something
  we tried the teppanyaki portion it wasn t busy so we were the only ones at the table the cook didn t try too many tricks maybe because we were the only ones there the fried rice was average the filet was cooked well the lobster was salty the service was great though and they had a friendly staff
  we went as a family of 6 and was treated very poorly by the manager at the place the food was greasy i guess most americans would love it since they don t see the difference the manager had the audacity to compare this restaurant with pf chang which is equally greasy and bad i wouldn t recommend this place to any health conscious people to top it all its expensive go to taco bell or china panda and save your frustration and your appetite just being fancy is not the attraction motto for me maybe they will train their managers to change the attire of the restaurant i wont waste my time here
  they have relocated to 51st ave and bell road ne corner by bj s auto spa wheat crust pizza and gourmet toppings are what makes this place great haven t tried their salads and sandwiches yet
  really good pho and great spring rolls great happy hour prices even my mom liked it
  can t believe the negative reviews that i read huh we must not have eaten at the same place i consider this place to be far superior to paymon s and all the other americanized versions of greek food that you can find here in town as for lapriel h that yelped about the man behind the counter was a will farrell look a like etc etc if you had read the literature on the wall you d have noticed that the man you re referring to is the owner originally from cyprus and he spends 14 hours a day there both cooking and interacting with the patrons i recommend the big fat gyro oh my it s amazing it s a mixture of lamb and beef and the meat is sooooooo tender the veggies are fresh and crisp and the feta is of a good quality the size of this thing resembles its name big fat the greek fries are fantastic a taste of lemon parsley salt and feta and lastly the baklava what i compare every single piece of baklava that i eat to my mother s who in my opinion still makes the very best but this was fantastic in so many different ways for those people who like baklava for its traditional flakiness this will satisfy your taste buds but with quite a twist it s covered with a honey sauce that makes it mushy to just the right degree almost a cake like texture i can t describe it can t put it into words it s a casual near fast food type place with a very homey atmosphere a
  very busy line is moving fast tho i got a chicken bowl was tasty i d go here again
  been here a few times very convenient location to my home love their torta s however the fact that they come with ruffle chips is a little strange on some of the larger tortas you could probably get away with splitting the meal or bringing it home with you salsa is spicier than many other americanized mexican food restaurants which is an added plus at the end of the meal they give you a dum dum lollipop only gripe would be the fact that their margaritas are non alcoholic they should really splurge on getting that liquor license
  we walk in for dinner and the place is packed i m thinking this might be a good pick then i realize it s first friday i curbed my enthusiasm the three of us are quickly seated we made reservations and then we waited and waited then the busboy comes over and asks if we d like water a minute later someone else asks if we d like water then our waitress finally comes to us and asks if we d like water i m sorry i didn t say yes to all three but i thought i d be nice this is starting not to look good we order our drinks and my beer tasted and felt like it had been sitting on a back counter patiently waiting to be served it s less then cold we ordered our tapas and waited 20 mins later my dish is served and only mine the second one served 5 10 mins later i had ordered the cordero chops australian grilled lamb chops the honey aioli served in a small plastic container along with a bit of cole slaw that had no flavor was slightly bitter with pickled shallots laid out as an after thought i understand tapas size serving portions but come on for 12 00 i d like to see my lamb chop one chop was a nice normal size but the other was half the size of my little finger the aioli sauce tasted like it should have been used for the cole slaw which did bring out the taste and the shallots well my daughter order the garlic camarones 12 00 she said they were ok which brings us to the paella velazquez 28 00 which my daughter and boyfriend ordered a disaster it was sent back it didn t look anything like the picture on their web site one of the main ingredients lobster was no where to be found some of the other parts to the meal appeared to be missing or undetectable i feel that if it s on the menu description you should be able to see and taste the ingredients because my daughter is more diplomatic and appropriate then i am she spoke to the manager the upside to this very disappointing meal was that the manager wrote off the paella plus gave us a 25 discount on the meal and if that wasn t enough she took it over the top with four free drink cards because of the manager going over and beyond we will try this small bistro again one last thing i d like to add i don t understand why so much confusion and unfriendliness of some of the wait staff no how are doing tonight our waitress didn t give her name the girl who brought out our food just plopped it on the table and left i expect this at cantors our waitress was ok i just think the service needs some looking into as well as the chef keeping a closer eye on what is being sent out under his name by the cooking staff there shouldn t be such a long wait time for food to be served and the entire order should come out at the same time instead of piece mealing it out
  service service service they always win us over with their smiles and positive attitude the lady at the register and drive through is super nice and consistently friendly plus i am a super fan of the special chicken roll and traditional teriyaky
  pittsburgh has never been big on restaurant chains but i have to say that i really like this location of the longhorn steakhouse my wife and i have gone here a couple times and have always had a good experience the past time our waitress didn t have much personality but i m sure thats not her fault she was attentive and brought us refills and checked on us several times wish she would have taken our salad bowls away before bringing the main course but maybe it was just an oversight overall a good place to get a steak
  wow as soon as i walked in i was pleasantly surprised it was so welcoming and everyone was very friendly felt like i was back home at my neighborhood bar the food was great and service with a smile i really felt welcome and will definately make hammer s one of my favorite places to relax and unwind
  decent experience overall i think they re prices are pretty good but it seems like a cheaper end sushi place the bench i was sitting on at a booth was all torn up and uncomfortable to sit on i ve been here before when it was much more bumping and energetic but i think this time was meh
  great place and price for family i got the build your own pasta garlic alfredo with shrimp it was pretty delicious got the sampler appetizers i did not enjoy it one bit our server maureen was amazing for what it is and the price i d give it a 4 star
  the only thing fast about this fast food joint is the employee turnover long waits in line and understaffed by people who don t want to be there truly dreadful
  beer made at the altar brilliant use of space
  solid 5 stars for an overall great experience this is my favorite kind of spot with excellent food and service but without any of the pretentiousness that is often found at top restaurants the food was inventive and excellent the braised leaks lived up to the high marks given by others our lamb entree was also a highlight the service was super joshua was friendly and engaging we took all his recommendations on ordering and was very happy with his choices if you plan to have wine i recommend skipping the main wine list that is exclusively arizona wines and asking for the plan b list with other better options
  i m not a vegan but i thoroughly enjoyed the tempeh bacon in my lumberjack sandwich i had for brunch i got the side of potatoes with the pomegranate bbq but i wasn t a fan of the sauce i switched it out for the spicy cheese dipping sauce much better it was a great breakfast i d def go back there again
  this place beets out all other quick food of its style the brown rice was fresh and moist not dry like brown rice at most restaurants i had the 4oz garlic steak cooked to perfection btw the only complaint is the neighboring business is a cross for gym and they drop the weights and make the floor shake which at first you might think it s the kitchen staff slamming doors but it s not i hope you open a second location closer to my home
  my favorite steak place in vegas id spend every birthday here if i could my favorites are the sirloin and bacon wrapped filet mignon
  you can t see this place from the road since it s hidden in a business mall across from the deer valley airport this is a very casual order at the counter kind of place and your food quickly gets ran to you i tried the smoked chicken and was expecting it to be pulled bbq chicken but instead it was two chicken thighs the chicken was very moist and tender with a careful gentle light smoke flavor i thought it was very good and didn t really need any sauce but i had to try one of the assorted sauces on the table for fun this plate comes with two sides i tried the cole slaw and it seemed very fresh was sort of sweet but it was drip free so i thought that was good i also tried the macaroni and cheese it was seasoned nicely and was familiar like what you eat at a picnic my husband tried the monster that was described to us as brisket and pulled pork with two sides it however is a sandwich of the two meats together topped with coleslaw like the smoked chicken i had the meat in this sandwich isn t all sauced up but you can use the assorted sauces on the table if you care too my husband did like the sandwich and said it was very good but would order something different next time because he s been here before and liked the regular plates better he said the beans here are very porky the staff thanked us for coming as we were leaving
  i was in the area and i had walked in the restaurant near to their closing time the owner was very hospitable after he came from the back room and he said he would have no issues if i wanted to order and or eat in at the restaurant even though it was their closing time i had ordered the combination plate everything such as the chicken kabob hummus rice etc tasted good and flavorful except for the lamb kabobs it was very well done to the point it was black hard and not edible when he asked me about the food i told him that everything was good except for the lamb was overcooked and he said he thought i wanted well done because people of my origins pakistani indian want well done meats the portions were huge the bread was not what other customers were saying homemade or fresh because it was cold and dry maybe they were out of it but i m giving four stars for the customer service and other portion of my food the owner was very nice friendly and catering allowing me to eat in at their closing time and the portion of my meal was very big
  i really like this place the sushi chefs are really friendly and offer you things to try they have a great bar outside to sit at and it s a fun atmosphere i come here a lot just to enjoy the view
  restaurant is nice we got the 2 enchilada plate which is the shredded beef enchiladas and the monterrey plate everything was pretty disgusting it tasted like what my cats food smells like we had a bunch left overs that we had no desire to take to go i ended up feeling sick to my stomach later in the night the only decent thing they had was the chips and salsa
  my guy and i stopped in today sunday he had to be at work before nine so we thought we should skip the bigger and busier places he had been here before dor a dinner take out which was good so we figured we would give it a shot the restaurant wasn t busy i honestly think if it were more visable the place would be busier which we didn t mind at all we could chat and leisurely eat without tables full of screaming mimis to start he ordered a coffe one of the best restaurant coffees either of us had tired and i ordered a cranberry juice i was plesantly surprised to see a huge glass as opposed to those tiny juice glasses most places have and expect you to pay for refills on to the food we are both biscuit and gravy addicts so thats what we got it comes with potatoes which i asked for extra crispy ones and that s exactly what i got the server was plesant and attentive when we asked about the friday date night he took the time to explain it in detail in short yummy food cooked fresh if i wasnt so vertically challenged i could have seen over the counter and watched meal being made great service relaxing atmosphere i spied a few more things on the menu i would like to try so i m sure we will be back
  great food and friendly staff excellent selection of pitas and they aren t afraid to load up the toppings very good value
  am i the only one who thinks this place is bit that great their servings for large are not that big and when i ordered beef fried rice there was hardly any beef in it their drinks are over priced they sell sushi but honestly would you buy sushi from a chinese place its like buying mexican tacos from an italian restaurant never coming back here
  update this place is still amazing my husband and i stopped in for breakfast and i actually had the breakfast 1 the pancakes were delicious i mean seriously decious 2 the bacon oh man the bacon fantastic it was the best bacon i ve ever had in my life really my life how s this possible actually i don t want to know i just want more bacon my husband has the chimichurri steak and eggs he loved it i loved it too i had to try it and i m glad i did i could kill for another pancake and some bacon
  i ve never eaten a mouthful of sand but if i did i can t imagine it would taste much different than the rice and beans served at tacos del mar if it is the goal of tdm to produce the most bland tasting mexican food on the planet they are doing a pretty good job in addition to the rice and beans not much can be said for their dry flavor free steak as well if you re into eating cardboard i suggest you try tdm s steak tacos you ll be in heaven i d give the place one star if it weren t for the friendly employees those bastards
  we went there this past weekend there are always private parties going on during weekends so be prepared to wait to get seated once we got seated we were right in the middle of traffic which was not very pleasant my husband ordered a chimichanga which he was not impressed with i ordered the fish tacos which were really good we do love their salsa and chips in the past we used to come to aunt chiladas frequently the atmosphere is fun and laid back we felt like something had changed this past trip aside from the menu we didn t get that warm fuzzy feeling we used to get while visiting i don t think we will be back
  everyday i wake up dreaming about these bagels this is the place to be the bagel man is such a hard working guy and is always welcoming to every customer that comes in he is there pretty much everyday and has a hard working crew too the bagels here are seriously the best bagels i have ever had i have even visited new york and these are on par if not better top cream cheese spread would have to be the scallion but the lox comes in a close second for me as for bagels the salt bagel is the best i have ever had the prices are great and it s a great pick me up early in the morning i m already looking forward to tomorrow morning just so i can have a bagel
  this pub is now an irish pub the fish n chips was heavy and oily and i could have made my sandwich better at home i think this is the third or fourth change for this pub can t understand why a place with good location good beer and possibilities of good food keep failing maybe it s because the food doesn t match
  excellent place for breakfast great vibe staff was friendly food was delicious tea setup was one of the better ones in the city soundtrack was engaging definitely the new mr luckys i can see this place packed late night with every night walker trying to nurse away the oncoming hangover with the hair of the dog and an extremely large omelette with tons of meat in it
  slow service i was expecting subway type of service i will try this place again when we are not pressed for time
  okay ya know when you walk in before noon and it s pretty packed and there s a table with tired looking hard working crew maybe landscapers all seated looking full it s gonna be plenty to eat so two in our party ordered the pb j bacon sriracha burger i ordered the bbq burger with the chef s creation of spicy pineapple bbq sauce so you need to know the rehab burger is 10oz of flame broiled deliciousness and the relapse burger much more manageable but still plenty with a 5oz patty you get a choice of a brioche or pretzel bun we all opted for the pretzel bun which was perfectly soft but held together well for the burger that definitely is smothered covered in the respective sauces a bit after ordering we realized waitress hadn t asked us of the size of burger after checking she d assumed the guys wanted the larger size one didn t mine the regular size so pb j burger had plenty of thick crisp bacon no skimping there the grape jelly peanut butter melt with the hot burger creating a bit of a slippery handful one in party said too much pb he said would order again without the pb the other said would absolutely order again mine absolutely smothered in tangy bbq sauce not too spicy cooked perfectly sauce everywhere they did great job with correct meat temp all had the sweet potato tots delish the sweet savory dipping sauces also very good we had elsewhere to be so couldn t take leftovers but was stuffed full ok so this is a little thing but in the restrooms they had actual towels to wipe your paws off this was very nice fun surfer dude decor good music and bar fun place
  this the second time in two years that i ve been to beijing 9 and both times were horrible the foods not bad what s horrible is that if you are with a group of people then food is served sporadically there was a twenty minute variant from when the first people received their order to when i got mine and that s after complaining to the management
  went here on a saturday night and waited over an hour for some sushi everyone at my table ate were served their food and my sister was already done with hers by the time i got my plate but the sushi was good but an hour wtf not cool
  just finished eating here with my family the food was absolutely awful all the meat was dry everything was very greasy the lo mein was orange and tasted like chemicals of some sort definitely will not be going back ever also very expensive 70 4 adults and 2 kids
  great gyros sandwich whole wings bretty good fries friendly service made to order like all greasy goods don t let it get cold when it s hot though it s great big portions too
  by far my favourite fast food place their pitas are great they don t skimp on anything i ve had most things on their menu my personal favourites are the double bacon cheeseburger and the chicken slovaki the only slightly disappointment are the fries which are only ok and the 14 subs which are only two 7 subs which are pretty minor given that the food is delicious if you are looking for quick meal and a great bang for the buck eat here
  mama mia this diamond in the rough aka strip mall is a true gem sayonara olive garden make room for bella luna this italian enchantment is near my neighborhood and is more than meets the eye i was a bit skeptical at first because of it s location but it has now become my favorite italian restaurant if i lived in mesa which i consider half way to nm from where i live i would make the drive regularly just for the fettuccine alla pancetta the creamy but not too rich alfredo is fantastic and mixed with the smoky pancetta and crunchy peas it becomes a pasta lover s oasis the lasagne is to die for and another favorite of mine is the gamberetti pasta a spicy arribiata sauce with crab and shrimp i have tried a few other things that friends and family have ordered but i have a hard time branching out from the greatness that is fettuccine alla pancetta each meal comes with bread with a delectable garlic butter and also a small salad which is fantastic as well the wine list is extensive and i personally like the house chianti i have yet to try any desserts as i am much to full to even window shop the menu i have only had a few minor negative experiences which all relate to one waitress the one with the blue eyeshadow but i have also had experiences with her that were satisfactory she s a capable waitress just don t catch her on a bad day where her service may be a little unfriendly or cold she always gets the orders right and is attentive since becoming a recent arizonan i try to bring any out of town guest here for a great italian meal that you can t get anywhere else this mom and pop shop tops my list of restaurant raves
  food was good had a skillet breakfast and flavor of the day coffee both were good above average for a typical breakfast restaurant i will be back
  excellent food great environment happy dedicated staff quality is always consistent please support local businesses like scramble often
  i like this japanese restaurant fancy and nice my friend and i order a plate of sushi i don t remember the name of it but it was good at first they forgot about my order but they were very nice and said our order will be ready soon they offered a mini dish with eel and this noodle thing i think because they missed my order that was very considerate it s a great place i recommend others to go
  loved this place it was a bit complicated to get to it s in the middle of imperial palace i ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles i was a bit surprised to find bacon inside of the waffles you may want to request plain waffles my husband ordered snicker flapjacks we both wasted a lot of food and that usually doesn t happen their portions are gigantic
  decor not bad but nothing really special food pretty good i really liked the various types of seviche they offered which included the fire and ice the crab and i believe the green seviche be aware that the fire and ice comes with a giant purple glob which is the ice they come in little spoons fancy i know so they are perfect for a group of people i ordered the chicken mole which was good i don t like curry that much so it was a little iffy but as an over all plate it is well done and the others liked it service they were very accommodating i was with a table of 8 and they made the space for us the waiter was new but very sweet he did great for being so new drinks delicious the strawberry balsamic was great as was the black smoke also don t forget to check in for the sangria i would recommend for anyone looking for a big group to go out
  wow we have driven by this place plenty of times but never stopped in the food was to say the least very impressive for a strip mall restaurant my wife tried the chicken piccata it was very fresh flavorful and tender i had the penne pepperonata it was very good lots of flavor and a good sized portion i had to take about 1 3 of it home and i m not exactly a small man the waiter was very pleasant and attentive we will most definitely return and also recommend it to friends
  pretty mediocre saw the place on triple d and wanted to try it wedding soup was good chicken parm was huge but not particularly outstanding tomato sauce had a strange taste to it place is a real dump but has character
  my family has ordered pizza from this location for almost 5 years we do a lot of carry out and not much delivery i ve ordered over the phone and thru the app we have had very few and minor mistakes by this location
  we love this place great staff excellent service and yummy food cooked right at your table this is a much better option than benihana the chef s always put on a good show and have lots of fun with the guests at the table also if you like sushi it is some of the best in the valley additionally they have a very generous happy hour everyday until 7pm
  consistently good food this is an underrated chain restaurant experience they are great with the kids and we ve had good service here on multiple occasions
  so my bf and i came back here for our 3rd time never wrote a 2nd time review bc it was great like the 1st time 3rd time meh not so good we ordered the caprese salad which is our fav but the cheese tasted like rubber it was so dry and hard and we were surprised b c it was sent out with huge pieces i told the waiter that it didn t taste right at all and he tried to convience me that it was more fresh and that is why it tasted like that i beg to differ i order caprese salad prob 2x week for yrs and this was not good he took the plate away and we sat and waited for 10 mins for him to at least offer us menus we never got them at that point i just wanted the pizza my bf ordered 6 wings which he said were average nothing special pizza was amazing like always the waiter returns and told me in fact the cheese was dried wrong and the manager and agreed and said that they were going to stop serving the caprese b c it got too dry or the water was taken out of it too much i don t really understand the process of making mozzarella cheese but i was happy he at least agreed with us kinda thought they would offer a small salad or dessert to compensate but nothing just had the pizza and my bf had some extra wings i would return but just b c i love the pizza there we may order the caprese again since it is such a big portion and usually really good but this waiter totally turned us off the last 2 times we were there we had female waitresses who were amazing maybe the male servers aren t that good hope i am not being too sexist hehe
  the food tasted as good as it looks on the menu we had oxtail pho fresh oyster garlic noodles with crabs pork belly buns and oxtail loco moco special everything was on point must try the pho and pork belly buns service was excellent and the atmosphere was great a nice break from vegas strip food
  worst organization ever after waiting 1 5 hours they stopped taking walkins and only reservations only so we waited an extra 45m 106 people ahead of us they don t accept reservations under 6 after all this the food was okay at best pass
  we ran across this great little bakery during our stroll through montreal there was a group of four of us which gave us the chance to order several different items and share everything was great especially the apple pie if you re near by save room for this place s great desserts
  we really looked forward to a perfect experience but only a couple things that semi ruined our time there was an obnoxious older couple that kept blowing their noses quite loudly into the napkins it happened several times during our meal which made it difficult to enjoy other than that service was nice we had the 16 course tasting menu and loved every bite we received copies of our menu and a bag of goodies to take highly recommend trying this indulgent adventure once
  taste 1 creativity authenticity 2 atmosphere 2 service 4 bang for your buck 3 5 are you serious how is this place still open what are you people eating here should have stuck with my first instincts and not stopped here but i love oysters and never been to this spot so my curiosity spiked and went in bad idea first off having only one type of oyster does not make you an oyster bar second got the clam chowder and the fish tacos eeeek me thinks not is right the clam chowder was ok but the fish taco wtf first off how do you mess up fish tacos well other than the cooked cabbage and frozen fish this is the worst fish taco i have ever had break down the fish was def frozen and tasted like plastic the shrimp taco was also frozen and tasted like plastic and to top it off why would you put the deep fried fish on top of the cabbage im guessing they let my tacos sit for a while because when i got my tacos bam cooked cabbage nice and soggy just the way no one likes em the only reason this place even got one star was the service the waiter offered to replace our tacos and when we said we didnt want anything he even took it off the bill good job thank you
  service here is great and some items are really delicious but i still think this is a pretty pricey joint for chinese food i would give it 3 stars for the value price and some not so great menu items but i m giving it 4 stars because i ate here twice in 2 days and i always left happy the dried scallop and duck e mein noodles are sooooo good it s a must try do not get the pork belly it is not worth 9 you get two buns stuffed with flavorless bbq pork the combination fried rice is really dry the vegas roll is ok the red bean soup for dessert is good
  my first visit to the square cafe was fabulous we were there on a beautiful sunny monday and it wasn t too busy we were seated quickly and our server was prompt and friendly the atmosphere was so nice everyone seemed relaxed and happy our food was great there s something for everyone i have not one bad or even ambivalent thing to say would definitely go back
  i went to capriottis on my last day in vegas and it was so good my friend told me how good it was and it lived up to its expectations i got a small tuna sandwich and it tasted better than an average tuna sandwich a small is 9 inches in length and without getting a drink or bag of chips it came out to be around 7 totally worth it because it was pretty big i ended up eating the first half for lunch and the other half for dinner if you plan on going with few others and agree to the same kind of sandwich i suggest getting one large and sharing a large is around 20 inches in length try the bobbie took a bite of it and it was good i will definitely go back to capriottis when i am in vegas too bad there isn t one in la
  went here today for a late lunch date with my hubby there were a few tables occupied but it was not slammed when i walked in i noticed a specials board outside that mentioned crab ravioli with a saffron cream sauce it sounded so delicious that nothing else was going to come up to scratch when we asked the waitress about the dish she continued the description by mentioning that it would be topped with a jonah crab claw which sold me on it though it was the most expensive dish on the lunch menu 28 it was worth every penny the ravioli was stuffed full of crab and no other filler and the sauce was heavenly and we took advantage of the bread to soak it up the crab claw ended up being 4 big crab claws it was amazing my husband decided to go with the linguine primavera in alfredo sauce with chicken this dish was delicious and the pasta was perfectly cooked the chicken was also perfectly cooked and a large portion for an add on the one thing i will say is that the alfredo sauce wasn t the cheesiest but i think the lightness of the sauce enhanced the dish we don t eat carbs that often and when we were leaving we said that this cheat was worth it we will definitely be back when we are ready for some serious carb heaven
  the tom yum goong here was good it had a great balance of hot and sour along with generous portions of mushroom tomato and shrimp at spice level 3 out of 5 my lips felt some fire but my tongue didn t taste much heat with this being the first dish brought out i felt that it was a strong start to the meal the other highlight of the night were the chop chop original thai style chicken wings the sauce was good the chicken not so much my palate and experience for thai food is admitedly limited since i always like to order panang curry and pad see ew whenever i m at a thai restaurant due to that habit i ve come to form my own expectations for these two dishes and those expectations were not met at mr chop chop the panang curry had a sweet flavor and the pad see ew tasted like noodles that were just heated up not much flavor was present one thing that was different about this meal was that each dish came out on it s own as if each dish was it s own course we were at the restaurant for two hours and much of that time was spent eating out of the five dishes we ordered four of them were ordered at the same time at the beginning i don t know if they usually serve their food one dish at a time but i was definitely expecting most of the food to come out together two stars says it all i ve experienced better
  the area is pretty sketchy but the burger was great there were tons of interesting menu items and i wish i could try each one but i went with the standard cheese burger of course i had to get it rocket style though the burger plus an order of fries could have easily been a challenge on man vs food with that said i couldn t finish the fries and burger which is a rarity for me for about ten bucks it was a pretty good value and well worth it the burger was well seasoned cooked perfectly and wasn t greasy the bun held up great so i didn t make a mess of my shirt as is almost always the case when i have a burger i will definitely return because the eddie lopez burger has my name all over it
  gluten free pizza for those that need want it barro s has it i have discovered a new taste treat for my pizza pepperoni pinapple and wait for it bacon yes it is soooo yummy and barro s makes a killer pizza i have gone to dine in a few times now and the first time i went in i was suprised at how big it is there is a large back room and a great little kid s korner with a long table and chairs and a flat screen tv on the wall the kids sit and eat their pizza and they can watch nick or the disney channel my daughter loves it this is a great place to hang out have a pizza and relax
  probably the worst quesadilla i have ever had not very big and served on small corn tortillas and it was also super expensive this place is not worth your time
  good not great overall ok food but rather average for the price buffalo chicken burger was good but not 12 good when it doesn t come with anything on the side also my chicken burger was skimpy on the toppings sweet potato fries on the other hand were quite delish they were enough to share between two people i didn t get a chance to try the milkshakes but they looked amazing the service was slow the place crowded consistently i d come back but would probably be inclined to try something different
  idk which is better the food or the service plus you can bring in your own alcohol two thumbs up it s only my second time here but the servers treat you like they ve known you for a while and the truffle bone marrow is off the chain the food here always seems to amaze me just when you think you tried it the chef always has something to impress you with nothing short of spectacular
  impeccable service every time we come prompt friendly and accurate we love coming here the food is delicious and i can t say enough about the service a lot of restaurants and service industry employees could learn about how to treat customers from this place we love it
  at first sight this little pho spot is clustered between a stream of fellow vietnamese shops and venues the sight is not the prettiest and the parking lot is usually difficult to manuver around however being from los angeles this place felt like a true pho joint straight from a big city upon walking in there are always a few vietnamese men eating pho and socializing it adds character to the place the lights are bright and flourescent none of that dim lighting ambiance the decor is not exactly five star aimed accomedations but who really cares we re there to eat gosh darn it this is a true mom and pop pho spot it may not be fancy but it feels surprisingly comfy no snootiness just good ol pho i would say the best pho i ve had in phoenix by a long shot i love this place the food is purely original the shrimp fried rice was great as well not exactly a hole in the wall the place is not that grimey it s a bit cute i might add all i really care about is the quality of the pho because i am a pho addict and have been known to eat pho up to four times a weeks at times so if you re in the pho mood and don t give a s about high end decor and want to get down with some real pho this is the place mmmm talking about this place is making me want to go right now yes it s that good
  this was my go to place and right around the corner so sad it closed the people who said they got bad service must be jerks because they employees were always prompt and courteous to me i m nostalgic for this place already tried a new place this week and it was terrible come back amier s
  had a great time bartender melissa was fun and was completely on top of everything we ve been here before service is always good and though the food is good it never changes and they don t seem to have specials
  best pho i ve had in pittsburgh their broth is wonderful and is by far my fav restaurant just wish it was much closer to where i live as i don t get to make it out to castle shannon very often sushi is reasonably priced and good quality better than any i ve had at nakama lol
  i like growlers but i almost never go there that usually means i want to like it more than i do unfortunately the beer selection while top notch is pricey and while there is technically table service it s a pretty informal system of grab an open table and hope a server comes by try the beer cheese and sausage it s a small menu but excellent it s a great atmosphere in a great neighborhood and worth checking out if the beer were priced better this would be a regular spot
  this was the last of the three lunch dates that the no1dp and i had on our most recent vegas trip we wanted to have a meal but not have the meal overshadow what we were going to have for dinner so we opted for classic comfort food without going to a fancy schmancy place that offered a lunch menu or a restaurant owned by a celebrity chef which is a lot of restaurants around the venetian palazzo area i had a feeling that the wait times were going to be long come lunch hour so around 11 45 i claimed my table for two which took around 5 minutes this ended up being a good decision because when the no1dp left workshops to meet me for lunch around 12 10 the line was out the restaurant no1dp and i sat in a table that was so small it could barely fit ourselves and our drinks plates and silverware much less what we ordered as there was another pair sitting to the right of the waitstaff couldn t put any extra food there to the left was the main walkway and kitchen area and we wondered how they were going to manage our orders once they were ready no1dp had a beer while i had these morning cocktails strawberry bellini 10 95 fresh strawberries champagne and triple sec the fresh strawberries were the star of this cocktail strawberries were still sweet enough to eat afterwards the grand mimosa 10 95 with mumm napa grand marnier and fresh orange juice i ve had better mimosas for cheaper balance between champagne and oj was a bit off we had the following dishes a la carte seared rare ahi tuna salad 16 95 romaine radicchio frisee and avocado tossed in vinaigrette we were warned about how big these salads were when the dish came out we thought the salad could serve 3 there were plenty of greens and ahi on that plate vinaigrette was tart and light ahi was lightly salted and quite soft though a little more firm than sashimi ahi as we were eating our salad the plates containing the two other orders were brought forth but the waiter noticed that since we had no room on our table he promptly brought the dishes back to the kitchen as we finished the ahi the waiter passed us by without checking up on us to see if we were finished nor asked us if we would like our other entrees next it wasn t until we prompted him about 15 minutes later to take away our salad plate to make room for the other dishes new orleans shrimp saute 14 95 shrimp tomatoes roasted peppers and cajun spices all simmered in a delicious tasso sauce served with steamed white rice and grilled bread the best dish of the three sauce was buttery smokey and a bit spicy long grained rice suited this dish well as it absorbed the sauce as did the thin and crunchy bread housemade pierogies 13 95 potato dumplings with slow roasted short rib mushrooms and onion garnished with green onion and sour cream both of us had pierogies before and we both agreed that this dish more resembled a gyoza than a pierogi pierogis can be heavy but are not supposed to be deep fried and heavy as this as we were already stuffed by the previous dish we struggled to eat even one pierogi supposedly they are more known for their breakfasts so i ll have to check that out one day but i ll explore other options for lunch and dinner
  the hostess was crazy off her handle so minus 1 star otherwise food was great wine was delicious and the ambiance was nice although we were seated in a private room and we had a frat house version of us nine girls across from us and then 2 quieter parties adjacent and to the right of us it was interesting the bill for 9 girls was a little over 1200 1300 i can t really remember but it was somewhere in that range we all got cocktails 15 each 200 bottle of wine so if you can imagine a lot of the bill was towards beverages i in fact spent more on beverages than my own food i had the encrusted salmon over cabbage replaced with string beans but everyone else s dishes were far superior we had everything from oysters on the half shell to caviar to lobster to king crab legs to lamb to chicken to lobster to rib eye to filet mignon to kobe carpacchio kobe tartar to lobster mashed potatoes and lobster bisque to the yummyness that is all food served at n9ne you name it it was at our table it was all pretty tasty all in all the wait staff was great and friendly the only issue my party had was with the hostess at the start of the night but i wasn t there to witness it main dishes range from 28 7x caviar ranges from 125 500 i think and all cocktails are 15 wine list depends and so forth you get the point
  closed on saturdays are you for real maybe closing a restaurant on mondays i would understand but on a saturday went to have dinner only to find out it was closed was walking away and another person was looking in the door lost two potential customers in a span of one minute btw food is good although they serve side dishes right before your entrees are about to come out which seems stingy under new ownership as of a couple weeks ago i believe sujebi no longer on their menu
  i m totally a fan of this spot for one main reason the back patio it s so spacious back there there s games tons of tables and benches and the option to grab some snacks and beer without having to go inside not to mention it s always a great selection of beer on tap so i ve tried something different with each visit i love the location and the vibe here so i m sure to be back several times
  went for breakfast at the recommendation of the hotel i was stay when i arrived it took a few minutes to have me seated even though the restaurant was empty should have been a sign of what was to come when i sat down i told the waiter that i was waiting on another person and they would only want coffee and was ready to order he brought the coffee but left me waiting for about 10 minutes until i asked another server to take my order i explained to her what the situation was and she had the audacity to tell me to relax the manager who came over could care less how her employees treat the customers so we walked out poor customer service would not recommend
  great burgers great onion rings and my friend loves the winky dinky dog also great homemade desserts a good ole local joint all around ask for bruce the super server
  i really like dominos but the inconsistency of this particular location is its downfall if i pick up my pizza it s fine but whenever i have it delivered it s always burnt the cheesy bread shouldn t even be given to customers like this and you know your pizza is burnt when your pepperoni starts curling up i m not one to call the store and complain i just hope the restaurant manager sees my review and can improve in that department otherwise good prices and friendly staff
  i visited nola for dinner on a saturday night we were crammed into a back table right next to the kitchen nola has an exposed kitchen but it didn t work for such a small space i looks tacky in the far back of the house the lay out of the restaurant was very awkward to walk through there was a narrow hall way with tables on either side my boyfriend commented that it looks as if two different spaces had been conjoined the portion sizes are very large here and come with a large price tag i got the mac daddy cheese which is macaroni and huge scallops i didn t finish my meal the scallops were cooked well enough however combining them with cheesy macaronis the dish missed its mark it was possibly the over crowed environment that made the food less appetizing i will not be going back to nola anytime soon i think they can use a little more care and attention going into the food they serve i gave this restaurant three stars because my boyfriend said that he enjoyed his meal there
  oooh lavo how i loathe thee i ll start off by saying thank goodness we were comped entry into this place this is a review for just the nightclub not the restaraunt tiny cramped and terrible my girls and i met a promoter who put us on a guest list so we got free admission and free drinks well they told us be there at 10 15 but doors don t open til 10 30 fine we get upstairs free drinks don t start until 11 pm that was annoying because that was all we went there for actually it wasn t even worth the free drinks this club shouldn t even be called a club it s just so small few bars and not enough bar tenders i d never buy vip at this place because you get a tiny little table and maybe 2 seating spaces for me vip is about having your own little space well you don t get that here the music was terrible the dj was horrible didn t know how to mix the music and it was a total buzz kill thank goodness we stayed less than an hour and made our way to surrender i ll never go to lavo again
  always a good call whether your out hitting the bars or ordering in to watch the game it s good quality big pizza for a fair price
  oh it hurts so good by hurts i mean the inevitable stomach ache you ll get if you inhale a 12inch hot sandwich in under ten minutes but maybe that s just me i really wanted to try something different this time but if it ain t broke don t fix it capastrami ftw my friend did get the philly cheesesteak however and i tried a bite of that and it was bomb i have a confession i ve never actually had a philly cheesesteak of any kind anywhere so i don t think these are super traditional but it was super flavorful tender and a little bit spicy from the peppers and onions if for any reason someone told me i couldn t eat pastrami and coleslaw i d get that fo sho
  fish and chips were very good fish sandwich was very tasty i was dissapointed in the jumbo shrimp cocktail the shrimps seemed to be very small don t think it s worth the price but the server alejandro was friendly and attentive and the oysters were absolutely delicious we ll be back to try other items on the menu
  i haven t been into a good asian korean restaurant like this in a ver long time i got number 2 14 and 45
  i called in for delivery from here they showed up when they said they would within 1 minute food was great loved the packaging i m going to do it again
  chicken noodle soup yummy
  its sam woo u know what ur getting
  i love the pho here my husband and i go one a week but the atmosphere is maybe not my favorite but the pho is the one bringing us back
  i was in mesa for business and had a craving for tacos the location does not scream delicious as it is a little hole in the wall but the food is awesome i ordered a couple tacos al pastor and a couple shrimp tacos the al pastor tacos were pretty good but the definite standout were the shrimp tacos the tacos came with a cabbage salad and a creamy sauce that both added greatly to the success of the dish the shrimp was succulent and not dry in the least after finishing eating i wish i would have skipped the tacos al pastor and just gotten another shrimp taco if you have a craving for mexican food i highly recommend trying out the restaurant i went on a friday night and it was pretty packed so the food took 10 15 minutes to come out but it was well worth the wait
  for people who love sushi buffet this is the place for you at buffets you wouldn t expect the freshest fish anyway this restaurant gives you decent quality of sushi and rolls but with a lot of variety after all if you are going to eat only one thing you shouldn t eat buffet so this restaurant knows how to perform its strong points well their sushi and sashimi was excellent for buffet quality and their rolls were also great they have a lot of tempura food and they even have soba and udon to choose from the price was reasonable and i was so full i couldn t function normally for a couple of hours afterwards overall this is definitely a recommendation
  i absolutely love love capriottis fast and delicious they have an amazing vegetarian menu which is hard to find at sandwich shops the veggie cheesesteak is my favorite for all you vegetarians it s vegan if you ask for no cheese definitely get the sandwich with hot peppers for extra flavor the capistrami is out of this world too
  in a week of many firsts i went to vegas for my 21st birthday which was during my senior year of undergrad study at ucla cliche i know but how can you not go to vegas for your 21st when you re in los angeles it s like a no brainer you turn 21 you go to vegas with all your besties you drink and gamble and drink some more you tear up the town looking gorgeous and dance till 5 am and walk home on the strip when the sun is rising and parents cover their childrens eyes as you walk by that s how it s done haha i m kidding mostly anyways let me get to the point of this review boy took me to l atelier de joel robuchon at the mgm grand for my romantic 21st birthday dinner on my 2nd night in vegas we had to wait a little bit for our seats but then we were guided to the counter by the hostess i wasn t thrilled with sitting there at first because those tall chairs hurt my back but in the end i am glad we did you get to see the inner workings of the open kitchen as the chefs and cooks hastily and delicately prepare the dishes one by one the counter is beautiful with red accents and all around in the middle of the open kitchen were glass jars and whatnot with various fruits and vegetables in them very beautiful in my opinion our lovely waiter came right up to us at the counter i think he might have been our cook too can t remember now to discuss the menu and how things were done there since neither of us had ever been to this restaurant or any robuchon restaurant for that matter we were advised to get an appetizer or two small tasting portions and an entree i honestly wasn t feeling well from the week s birthday celebrations so i did not have the stomach to order a lot of food even though i wanted to i order a scallop tasting portion and a salad tasting portion i know you regulars are probably laughing at me right now to start we had the famous jr amuse bouche which was soooo delicious i could not understand what our waiter said was in it and to my horror afterward i found out there was foie gras in it at that time i did not eat foie gras out of ethical reasons whoops out of my inexperience i only ended up ordering the two tasting dishes thinking they would be enough for me in my current gastronomical state nope i was wrong tiny tiny tiny i was still a little hungry after eating literally two bites of food which cost probably 40 blah my boy was sweet enough to give me part of his steak tartar excellent btw which helped curb my hunger i had watched the chef prepare his steak tartar mixing it in the bowl with the capers and vinegar and all those other yummy things they put in there this was actually the dish that started my love affair with raw beef so that says a lot since i never ever considered eating tartar before this all in all l atelier in vegas is a nice place to go for a fancy dinner but make sure your wallet is full and that you understand how much food you re getting ask the waiter is this enough and they will let you know i happily look forward to the next time i am in sin city so i can fully appreciate and get my money s worth from the experience at this restaurant luckily i won t be turning 21 again
  if you can t make it to the real deal then the next best experience is this restaurant nestled in the heart of the strip with an unparalleled view of the strip this is the most romantic dining experience you will have in vegas the elevator trip up builds the anticipation of dining in the tower the atmosphere is elegant and warm we had a view of the fountain show at the bellagio the food is amazing but bring your appetite because you re definitely going to want to wine and dine and indulge with dessert the waiter prepared a special dessert for our celebration as a surprise and the chocolate mousse was exquisite the et offers a truly posh night out with a french twist
  i love chino s you need to test a few things out but once you find your combination you ll be hooked my combination is the hengernage quesadilla and jerk fried rice delicious
  took my granddaughter to eat here i had eaten here before the food was good i should have stopped while i was ahead we had to wait for a table which i expected on a saturday night wait was not that long 20 minutes got to table took quite a while for waitress to come by finally ordered waited and waited and waited when food came out it was awful granddaughter s chicken strips were the size of her finger she s 8 there were 3 of them even together would not equal one at any other restaurant her sweet potato fries were burnt i sent that back my sirloin was bloody rare which i ordered medium rare my baked potato was hard cold finally got different fries but by the time we left we had been in there one hour and 45 minutes
  we went here for lunch the dishes that were ordered were roasted sweet corn soup clam chowder lobster roll and a surf and surf dish the sweet corn soup was a bit sweet for my taste of course there is the word sweet in the name of the dish so that should be assumed the razor clams were good clam chowder was ok the clams were a bit tough it had the viscosity that i like not overly thick i really enjoyed the chunks of lardon in the soup the lobster roll was good although it was a little heavy on the creme fraiche the surf and surf was not what i had imagined it is crab and lobster on a bed of wheat orzo tossed in a beurre blanc sauce i guess i didn t pay attention to the surf and surf in the name of the dish what was served was what looked like two huge king crab segments and a whole cut up lobster the orzo with beurre blanc sauce had a very bright lemon flavor to it and cut the richness of the seafood the service and environment was good considering it was lunch the surf on surf dish was overall the best dish i had for this vegas trip regardless of the cost but wow it was big bucks for a lunch
  the first time i walked into cafe zupas i thought the whole process was very interesting mostly people in their 20s worked there and they are very fast the food there is absolutely amazing and has really reasonable prices i would definitely recommend coming here
  how does a burger place with bacon on every item run out of bacon poor management which leads me to question the rest of the food prep etc it will be a while before i try this place again
  i made reservations for my daughter s graduation dinner her only choice out of anywhere she was told to choose at bar louie in station square our reservations were for 26 people 24 were able to attend and was told that they could handle a party that size we have been there in the past and never had a problem with the food or the service not the same experience on may 7 our reservations were for 5 30 and people started arriving around 5 15 several of us ordered drinks outside with two very friendly and competent servers i even asked if we could request them for our party but they were not able to do that we were seated inside around 5 20 and two new servers took our drink orders one person at my table there were three tables set up for us got his drink but it was wrong at 5 50 at 6 10 i walked to the bar with another of my guests who was still waiting for her drink and asked the bartender what the hold up was he said that they were very busy even though there were several empty tables and were working on our drink orders my guest asked if she could get her drink now since we were standing at the bar and the bartender told her that he was waiting on several other customers and wasn t able to take her order he quickly decided to get her drink i m sure the look we gave him help to change his mind i told him that we would like our drinks promptly and that we were also ready to place our meal orders two different servers came with the drinks two were wrong and needed to be sent back and proceeded to take our meal orders the one server was not writing down any orders not sure about the other server and when i made a comment she said that they never write down the orders i think if that is a policy it needs to be change soon when they finally started bringing our meals five of them were wrong and had to be sent back to add to our frustrations our servers were very rude when the guests told them that their orders were wrong when my daughter mentioned to the one server that the other girl had been very rude she was told that that s how we all are we are very busy at that point i asked to speak to the manager i told him about the long wait incorrect drink and meal orders and the rude attitudes of his servers he apologized and said he would see what could be done he came back and said that he wanted to comp all of our meals and drinks which is not the reason i complained i told him that we did all get meals eventually and i didn t feel comfortable not paying for anything he insisted on comping the meal and we settled on paying for the drinks i wish i had let him pay for everything the orders were all wrong except for one and when one guest realized that there were charges on her debit card that belonged to another guest and asked if they could void it and run it through correctly she was told that they couldn t void the charge my guests squared it between themselves which there was no need for that and the bill was still 5 00 over what it should have been my guest then asked them to just bring her a drink to make up for the difference and was told that they were not allowed to do that another guest went up to the bar to pay since they were taking so long in collecting our bills and waited 10 minutes while the bartender stood at the other end of the bar talking with other customers my guest asked to speak to the manager again and told him what happened and he refused to pay for his drinks bill which i don t blame him i told the bartender all six servers and the manager that they have lost 24 customers i feel this is a direct reflection on the manager that was there that evening aside from when i asked to speak to him i never saw him out of the floor and believe me i looked for him through out the rest of the evening i m not sure what was going on in the back but i feel he should be on the floor checking on his guests and keeping up with his employees this was not good business and as a result bar louie has lost several customers
  this review is for the lovely sunday brunch comme ca was featured on the best of the vegas on the 702 show which was on a 24 hour loop in our hotel room one viewing and i knew this had to be a stop among our culinary lv visits comme ca sits at the top level of the swanky cosmopolitan hotel and boasts 360 views of the strip redolent in its restrained elegance and attitude huge loft setting with well appointed seating soothing grey tones and wrap around windows with views of the bellagio and the strip beautiful modern setting with very approachable prices and a welcoming environment comme ca features exquisite french dishes without all the fanfare and hoopla it s just all about great food comfort relaxation and fun times invariably we started with the formage cheese plate and some beautiful french wine the cheese toast and wine combination was the perfect precursor to our cosmic meal the croque madame and the quiche du jour were outstanding unlike some french joints these dishes have staying power you will be full all day the croque madame was wonderful toasted ham and gruyere cheese sandwich topped with a fried egg tastes as a good as it sounds the egg cacaded down the sandwich without usurping the softness and essense of the brioche bread the quiche was spectacular fluffy creamy and well seasoned eggs whipped and cooked to perfection infused with gruyere cheese and leeks nothing like your typical cafe quiche both served with a fresh vinagarette salad i highly recommend this wonderful french find with ravishing dishes by the brillant chef david meyers
  well after so so many years of driving by it and looking at the ghetto joint being tempted to stop and try it reading all the reviews made me make a uturn and stop by today was not disappointed at all i ordered a lucky boy burger with some fries and a regular dr pepper fries were hot off the fryer crunchy and soft in the middle nice amount of salt to make it very tasty the burger the burger i love charbroiled burgers it gives it a nice char taste damn very yummy only thing is that they added a tidbit to much catsup but it was fine after i almost finished it wow burger was big filled my big ass up lol will go back and have a taste of some of the other items on the menu
  went in here one afternoon lets just say i didn t have a very good experience first i ordered a slice of pizza one bite and i spit it out worst pizza that i have ever had in my life period everything on it was horrible the cheese wasnt even melted thankfully the waiter took it back at no cost i ordered the chicken sandwich and it was alright anything could beat that pizza i wrote a nice letter in explaining what happened and never got anything back i was at least expecting a sorry please come back but no maybe in 40 years i ll come back
  they have the finest most delicious juicy burgers out of this world shakes we had the banana strawberry shake they use real fruit yummy
  after first dining here several years ago we were excited to return when we stayed off the strip it was a busy hoppin joint but we got a nice table right away our server was friendly and efficient we had several dishes which were all so delicious the meat was perfectly cooked the sauces were nice and the vegetables were fresh my only complaint was that it all came out so quickly i would have rather lingered over small courses we shared a pitcher of sangria and we sadly could not finish it all very generous pitcher the sangria was stellar with nice chunks of fruit floating within
  we never leave vegas without hitting hot n juicy at least once we can t get enough of the huge shrimp crawfish and the hnj special sauce the place can get crowded but definitely worth the wait don t be afraid to get messy order plenty of rolls to soak up the yummy sauce
  very cute interior and the staff could not have been friendlier they were so pleasant craving a sandwich of some kind i went here on a friday afternoon i d read a few reviews prior to going so i was expecting to be little disappointed in the size of the sandwiches but not the quality and that was true greeted so kindly by a host at the door which is an old garage door very cool with a menu and suggestions for what to order at lunch i knew the place was so hip and cool the guy at the counter greeted me and again helped me order a sandwich with plenty of helpful suggestions i ordered thier most poplar sandwich 25 anything with turkey and avacado is my weakness i grabbed bag of chips and paid like 8 for it the register girl complimented me on literally everything i was wearing um hello new best friend the sandwich was hand delivered to me and was so delish they re more like sandwich pockets we used to make the same things as a kid but put pizza in them just take 2 slices of bread add your ingredients in the middle take a circle cookie cutter to punch it out then glaze it with butter or something and bake in the oven zooks did the same thing but way better was i sad to see the sandwich was so small yes i was but was i pleased with the shredded turkey avacado tomato and spicy mustard you betcha i d give zooks a 4 but i wasn t exceptionally im pressed with the interior or seating arrangement of the place but don t get me wrong it s still really good
  sauce is a great restaurant i grew up in arizona but moved to california a few years ago and unfortunately sauce doesn t have any locations in california so every time i m back in town i try and make a visit to sauce they have great pizza and salads they re similar to california pizza kitchen but i definitely think they re superior quality my two favorite items on their menu is the chicken caesar pizza and the sausage and caramelized onions pizza i only wish they d build a location in california
  wow is this pad thai excellent we love to find great pad thai food and this was a lucky find clean place including the bathroom the menu looked great we will return
  i know everyone loves this place but i m pretty over it the portions are just gratuitous and some of the flavors just aren t there i think it s a place everyone should try once
  meh asked for cajun fries they were out i asked for chicken dishes with white meat none beef quality was average went for 14 99 lunch after we sit down they tell us 19 99 on weekends decent food but not anything spectacular here and lack of choices for me 53 00 for lunch for 2 is no bargain with tax and tip kimchi was awesome though
  we cold called this establishment as a precursor to the raiding the rock vault show and it was fantastic our server ashley was super professional and delightful we ordered two appetizers a salad and several main dishes for our party of three and shared everything family style the veal parm was a ginormous bone in veal chop that was tender and succulent and the lobster ravioli spectacular total bill with a bottle of the house merlot about 50 per person
  had an order come out pretty late but the management made it right by giving the order for free the pad thai was pretty decent includes lots of sprouts
  i have tried multiple different italian food places throughout the valley and nothing in the slightest compares to cucina tagliani let me start with the decor first and get that out of the way yes it looks like an italian village or something however isn t that what you expect going to an italian restaurant it sets the mood and why it may not be the most original it works now for the food wow the best part is the pick a pasta option you choose the type of pasta you want with the type of sauce and the added meats veggies etc you build your entire meal and it has never failed there are over 10 options of pasta like 7 types of sauce which all are delicious depending on what you like and the add ons range from meatballs to chicken to sun dried tomatoes and on there are plenty of options for everyone i usually get the tortellini with either the dynamante sauce spicy or the meat sauce red wine sauce then add sundried tomato ground sausage and mozzarella to die for my girlfriend always gets the gnocchi with tomato fredo sauce meatballs and mozzarella not only can you do this but if you order the half size you get a big portion but if you order the full then you get a massive portion to last you anohter day lol and if you ask nicely on the full they will allow you to pick 2 sauces and have half as one half as the other so if you are indecisive or just wanting to try a ilttle of everything it works they have plenty of the classic staples as well from lasagna to chicken alfredo and pizza for those who just want classic italian food and each is prepared perfectly everytime i love that all the sauce is prepared that day so you can tell the slgith difference every time you go in it is very affordable and won t break the bank the caprese salad is amazing as well with the best balsamic vinegar i have ever taster and the service is almost always great i have been to all 3 locations and never been disappointed oh and their desserts are pretty good if you have room i suggest the marscapone cake just like any restaurant servers may or may not be busy totally on top of it but when they do ask if you need anything they will get you anything and quickly so just bare with them on a busy night but as for the overall grade at cucina tagliani nothing but the best everyone i have taken there has become a loyal customer now and with my 2 year anniversary coming up this monday i know i will be enjoying another great meal there
  the hot dogs are absolutely delicious i am not from chicago nor am i a hot dog connoisseur i am simply a dude who loves hot dogs so i m not biased on whether or not these are authentic chicago dogs i tried the dirty harry dog a vienna beef wiener topped with a mound of bbq pork this was so darn good that i had to gorge myself and order a second one this place is very small but has a very cool vibe to it definitely a place i could see myself being a regular at warning consuming the dirty harry hot dog will give you the urge to bring about justice using a huge 45 revolver
  buffet s are bad wait i take that back they are dangerous and worst of all they are extremely bad for people like me who run in there pushing down anyone in my way to get a look at the vastly large circle of food all smelling delicious and looking might good as it glistens in the light and go early to avoid the line we went at 4pm and stayed till 8pm even reloaded as i walked passed the desserts to my table i found myself at the center in front of the roast station with the seafood to my left and italian to my right it was like being a kid in a full on candy store and knowing that i could eat as much as i want was dangerous so what did i have seafood large cocktail shrimps were a little bit tough as if they were frozen for some time but i do like me some shrimp the ocean called they re running out of shrimp the alaskan crab was excellent and we each got a cup of butter to go with each of it you d think a cup of butter is that necessary but its all to make it easier to dip chinese the siu mai was good and the egg rolls were hard to look away from normally i d tell myself to only eat the stuff that are worth and not found anywhere else this rule doesn t always work roast my favorite dish was the lamb i kept going back for 3rds and it makes me very happy that several pieces of this was in my stomach which made me full somehow they managed to make it very tender and it tasted like butter as you bite off the meat the prime rib was alright i didn t even finish my entire piece skip the turkey grill the veal short ribs were another favorite of mine here even scored me some asparagus on the side which was nice the kalbi shank had a nice flavor but still somewhat dry dessert i think the creme brulee was well worth getting above everything or maybe get some fruits since if you re like me you fear that you eat so much that my diet is going to not like me for a buffet it s definitely good but some small things got me dissapointed still worth 40 tho
  went here the other night with a buddy have to say wasn t that impressed with the menu or selection neither the atmosphere i ordered the 3 which is the crispy honey chicken we had to wait over 15 minutes for our food the chicken was definitely not made in house it was some something like tyson any tizers chicken with honey sauce poured over it it had a weird taste and i was left feeling a bit sick afterwords the dish says it comes with a vegetable but what it really comes with is cabbage slaw that i found to distasteful it also came with a salad that had an unpleasant dressing over it the atmosphere is not something special also their rice cooker was dirty and looked like it needed a good cleaning the employees there lacked personality and seemed to not enjoy what they are doing also the cook was on his phone while he was cooking which i find to be rude definitely will not be coming back here anytime soon
  i ve been hearing about this place from co workers seeing this place on the travel channel in food wars and other specialty food shows and a couple months ago finally got to try it the inside is very nice not really what you d expect in a pizza joint red white checker topped tables surrounded by framed pictures of new york city points of interest bridge and old time celebs frank sinatra dean martin on all the walls there is a small bar also there is seating al frasco too in one corner there is a round table for a cozy get together the service is pretty good the staff is nice and friendly the atmosphere is nice it s a little small but there is also seating at the bar and al fresco too the pizza is pretty good thin crust good sauce good cheese my husband i shared a pie had leftovers i think maybe my husband who is half italian thought it was good but not spectacular at the time the baby wasn t eating too many solids so we didn t share our meal with him funny story the baby was having his bottle and he ended up falling asleep at the table in the highchair about the menu choose the item and size personal small large pizza calzone and then select your toppings which takes up half the menu meats veggies extra sauce basil garlic etc if you get any starters it s several choices of salads also has desserts cold drinks and wine beer i m curious about the calzones i could order it for pickup i would definitely try this place again
  another great breakfast with my wife fast service and friendly staff judging by the almost full house others agree wife loved the crepes while my more traditional eggs and sausage hit my spot or area if i keep it up
  yes there will be await but worth it once you are seated they take excellent care of you and the food was out amazingly fast and every bit of it was delicious can t believe i ate the whole thing
  the sandwich was adequate if uninspired pretty much what you expect from a subway this was my first visit to one of these chain stores in several years and will likely be my last for the foreseeable future even amongst chain sandwich shops there are so many better options available i was waiting for a connecting flight and was wanting something that involved fresh produce hadn t seen much of that during my trip and this was the best option available i m not certain if the staff were being rude or simply incompetent but it took forever to both order my food and receive it there are many other food options at mccarran int l airport so i d recommend skipping this one
  very tender meat and the sauces are very flavorful ordered the pulled pork and sliced brisket with pit beans both the pulled pork and brisket were done very well they were incredibly tender and nowhere did i need a knife to cut since they pretty much melted on command the meats were not smokey or salty the pit beans were and interesting combo i ll try a different side next time their sweet sauce is very flavorful their hot sauce really hits the spot i couldn t decide which one i liked better maybe the hot sauce the only downside i could think of was the soda fountain is difficult to access since you have to climb over people in line to get a refill they also don t let you sit on the tractor
  very good for a fast food style restaurant i enjoyed the quinoa salad without the cheese seems like a popular place for families
  this is the worst restaurant i have ever experienced in vegas i was looking for a moderately priced asian restaurant on the south strip and looking at the menu online beforehand saw a lot of things that sounded good i should have known otherwise when we walked in and only 2 tables were occupied dining companion and i both ordered chicken dishes for the main course she thought the chicken tasted rubbery as did i i usually associate this with undercooked meat we both got very sick to the stomach about 2 hours later and these dishes were the likely culprit we spent the remainder of our evening on the toilet back at the hotel room the only positives were that the server was attentive because there were only like 7 customers at 6pm and the chicken satay appetizer which appeared to be cooked properly was actually pretty good don t go here even if you are trying to burn casino comps or something read the other reviews we aren t making this stuff up
  ok i love this place 5 stars it gets i love the hours and the food and the service where s my thumbs up emoji it s been so busy recently too but luckily we can still be seated pretty quickly i love the loud noise of people buzzing and the korean music blasting they re like new songs too
  good solid gyro plate or sandwich the chicken shawerma looked great to i just wish the had chicken kebab too
  i suspect this place is new and still working the bugs out because there is much room for improvement there were 4 people in line when i arrived and it took 15 minutes to get a cup of unremarkable drip coffee that was already made i would not want to be here when it s busy because it simply can not take 15 minutes to serve a cup of coffee
  this place is good good food good service good prices good wine the only thing that is really great is the portion size you can easily share a meal the cheesecake factory owns this place and it runs about the same we got a side salad as opposed to the meal salad and it was huge too one side salad and one main course dinner for two easy only complaint was that when we asked if pasta was made fresh on premises we got an evasive answer he should have just said no it was not made fresh on premises he said it was all made for them and some other language that appeased us at the time but disappointed us a bit when the food came and the pasta was obviously not fresh i know we were dreaming to think we could get fresh pasta made that day for that price but we were in vegas where my sister eloped and dreams come true right on the upside the pasta was not over cooked and limp all in all a solid meal and i would go back especially if i were trying to get decent food at a decent price on the strip this is almost as low a price as a place like nathan s famous hot dogs especially if you share a main course which the portion sizes will definitely let you do but here you get to sit down and eat a nice meal for us especially nice because my new brother in law bought us dinner thanks paul
  we splurged on the cabana table and the top chef tasting menu what a wonderful experience and great food and service the waiters were attentive but not snobby highlights were the first course which was lobster langostino shrimp scallop clams and octopus the octopus melted in your mouth dessert included 9 scoops of different gelato and ices but the best was the semifreddo possibly the best bite i ve ever had on our way out we ran into the chef all in all s beautiful upscale evening we enjoyed more than spending that money on a show you need to be a fish lover for this menu and we are
  get the steak and cheese sub with mushrooms
  worst exerpience i have ever had at a fast food place not only was it almost a 10 min wait to order in the drive thru with only 2 cars ahead of me but then they have me park the car out front and say they will bring it to me i can understand if there is other cars behind me that have small orders so they can keep the flow going but there wasn t any i had to wait for 25 mins for them to bring out my food i will never come back here again unless i bring a book with me to read while i wait for thus food to come out
  best steak sandwich i ve ever had although the ribeye sandwich i had was thoroughly cooked it was still very tender and flavorful the prices are not cheap but it is worth every bite i wish i had the chance to try more from their menu the new restaurant is very nice the decor gives the right ambiance for the type of food they are serving would recommend this to anyone who s visiting pittsburgh
  this may be my favorite place to go for a couple of reasons first off we ve been for after dinner cocktails appetizers a couple times fantastic the drinks for the most part are pricy up to 18 for a martini but what you should be aware of is that they pour you a full drink and leave the shaker with you so for 18 you re really getting 2 very high quality drinks it is absolutely worth it i usually order 1 and call it good couple times we ve gotten 2 and i ve definitely felt it i had a 3rd once and almost didn t make it home the alcohol is top shelf quality and smooth as can be wife loves the cantaloupe martini sweet and smooth i ve tried a few different the ceo martini is a great fantastically smooth martini love the blue cheese stuffed olives that come with it i always ask for extra the manhattan is strong and tasty as well we ve also gone for dinner it s pricey sure but really worth it the seafood tower appetizer can really add up on your bill but the quality is as good as it gets in arizona very cold very fresh just perfect the bone in filet is probably my favorite always cooked just right for the side dish you cannot pass up the lobster mashed potatoes it is absolutely decadent and swimming in butter but it is soo freaking good love the pretzel bread that they put out on the table as well service is always fantastic as you should expect from a place like this the place is nice and you would fit right in wearing a suit although truth be told i ve gone dressed much more casually than i should have and no one has given me a hard time
  omg knowing what real texas bbq taste like i was skeptical but this really hit the mark it s so frkn good almost just like my daddy s
  ohh man that was awsome the hot n juicy mild shrimp was good
  i never thought i d find a better cajun seafood place than boiling crab until i came here sorry bc but hot n juicy just has their sauce spot on something about that hot n juicy special sauce it has a similar taste to the whole shebang but it has a creamy butter factor that knocks it out of the park got a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish with a side of cajun fries it was awesome
  this place reminds me of a backyard family barbecue the juicy burgers and fried zucchini are great if you re a bacon fan you ll fall for the grilled mound of bacon on each of their bacon burgers the tijuana torpedo is also a winner their cash only policy is a slight inconvenience but my gripe would have to be the inefficient ordering process it does allow you to watch your burger cook however
  use to be a great little spot not so much anymore no more 1 budlights
  very convenient location nice ambiance and architecture service was amazing downside was sadly the food overpriced fish was overcooked and bio chicken a bit dry and too simple plus they don t have a dessert menu yet they only had a cheesecake with blueberries on top which was delicious cocktail i ordered was yummy though i don t remember the name but it was made of elderflower liquor st germain and gin jargo opened two three months ago so i believe they can adapt and do better than that
  we had my friend s bachelorette dinner here on oct 1st none of us has ever been here the bride picked it when we were strolling along in the forum shops we had a party of 10 and they sat us right next to the wall of wine which was cool with us cause it was in the cut and we knew we were going to be loud i ordered the stuffed eggplant i forgot what it was called on the menu but hot damn it was good my friend got the tuna salad it was ok we both concluded that it would have been tastier with albacore tuna the tuna they used was like chicken of the sea tuna or something it was bland they had specialty drinks and so i ordered the bride a citrus type mix martini again i forgot what it was called on the menu well it wasn t on the menu it was on one of those ads placed on tables the bride loved it she said that it tasted really good and even asked if there was alcohol in it then by the end of the night she told me that the drink was kicking in it was creeper haha that was great out waitress brought out a complimentary bowl of gelato for the bride but it was so huge that we all had dibs on it overall i enjoyed my dinner and the waitress was great the company was even better
  at first we were skeptical of the chinese mexican combination but it was delicious and flowed effortlessly from dish to dish for five of us we ordered 6 dishes and a taco each and it was the perfect amount of food the chips and guac was really amazing but so was everything we ordered our best meal in vegas
  i ate here for lunch i took the teriyaki chicken bento box i took white meat the chicken was so so too mushi i took brown rice and the box comes with tempura vegetables and half a philadelphia roll not sure if i ll take the chicken again sushi seemed ok i ll give the place one more chance in general great atmosphere and great service
  i wish this place was in l a every trip to phoenix i come here the happy hour beer prices are mind boggling 6 for a pitcher of blue moon count me in wings are a and pizza is b and prices are dirt cheap oh and everyone is super friendly and the service is very good looooove this place this is the sort of down home awesomeness that i don t think even exists in los angeles
  in a cute cobblestone alley in downtown charlotte this place is a little confusing though it is the same place as valhalla pub and eatery or is somehow associated stopped by for a drink on the patio on a tuesday afternoon the bartender appeared to be the only person working and was moderately attentive drink selection is standard wine selection is decent with average by the glass price being 8 10 atmosphere inside is very pub like and feels quite casual for being a wine bar
  for anyone who says doing half and half pizza sauces as in half margherita and half banana peppers and sausage is weak lemme tell you they re making the pizza in the kitchen they are under pressure orders flying in from all different angles take out here order in there medium with extra sundrieds sub black olives for broccoli add pine nuts extra sauce it s no joke so that being said they can t always split a pizza in half because the sauces just don t mix and they gotta cook it and prep and all that jazz so is the pizza good yes hands down this pizza is really friggin good the bbq chicken is wet my pants good the algo malgo or whatever it is called is truly delicious if you re looking for a quick lunch spot get your ass in there and enjoy the pizza salad lunch deal for it will not disappoint order the cheese slice if you like but since they have the dozens of toppings to choose from live a little and put some meatballs or eggs or fresh artichokes and make it the way you dream it overall one of the top pizza place in madison or middleton
  it s too heavy fatty for me i had the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can and it s a bit too much of grease i won t be coming back but the place has a good vibe and i can understand why is so popular
  great food i had the steak my girlfriend chicken royale and both your amazing the service is excellent as they are completely on top of things another thing that was extremely nice is even though they were i would say 80 85 full we still had our amazing food in around 20mins
  cantina which serves upscale mexican food with an interesting twist is a great place to go for a nice date i so enjoy the chicken burrito generously topped with a queso sauce that i pretty much always get that my boyfriend really likes the tacos marco polo shrimp bacon and caramelized onion s in flour tortillas with pico de gallo and melted cheeses the margaritas are awesome i d recommend getting a pitcher for your table while every table gets chips and two kinds of salsa i d also suggest ordering the guacamole the water mixes up the fresh avocados and other ingredients right at your table cantina isn t just a restaurant it s an experience because it s so good it s packed most nights call ahead and make a reservation or it could be a long wait
  i have been to the factory in phoenix wasn t the least bit impressed my family wanted to try this one i was hoping for the best but yet again i was disappointed its like another olive garden with everything premade so its nothing special and you can t customize anything its only the way on the menu and thats it no special orders i dont know what the big hype is with this place this isn t real italian and its nothing to write home about there was nothing to be impressed with from the soups to the lame salads to the meal all was mediocre and if you ask me they charge to much for the quality of the food i got the ravioli totally lacked flavor and their marinara is bland as well now that i have had both places i hope to never return the food sucks
  complete let down i can t believe that i waited 3 hours for a table giada is my absolute favorite and was hoping for a knockout experience but i left totally bummed unlikely i will return but if i do it will be once they sort all the kinks out
  this is now one of my favorite places in charlotte easily the ambiance food and service is all spectacular top notch you get the picture the salad bar appetizer bar was phenomenal there are tons of choices such as salads soups rice and beans breads cheeses etc then there is the meat oh the meat i was in heaven had the best pork sausage of my life so far at this restaurant no lie on top of all this other food you also get a few side items delivered to your table from what i can remember there were plantain fries mashed potatoes parmesan bread balls and a few others the mashed potatoes were sooo good they were so creamy it was more of a mashed potato puree one of the best items at this restaurant imho i could eat them everyday for the rest of my life the service was outstanding a new drink was at my table before my current one was empty the side items were refilled as soon as we ran out waitress was super attentive i wasn t doing any boozing that night so i cant really comment on the beer prices but i did notice that they were offering 4 martini s while i was there overall i had a great experience here the only thing i could possibly complain about is that it really sucked when i got so full i had to stop eating that made me sad lol addtl info regular price is about 40 per person however if you sign up on their website you will receive a 25 off coupon also on sundays if you have theater tickets to blumenthal they have a buy one get one free offer that s a damn good deal
  came here for a birthday dinner celebration no doubt the steaks are prime quality could have been seasoned a little bit better for my taste the extra 2 for sauces is a little tacky for a high end restaurant honestly the sides are mediocre except for the onion rings best i ever had i believe the side dishes at maestro s are tops desserts were average had the chocolate souffle and banana cream pie service very snooty you pay 1450 for dinner i expect some rapport with the customer for the money i think you can do better at other steakhouses eg maestros
  excellent thai food we had the drunken noodles with shrimp green curry with tofu and the crispy rice appetizer the service was excellent and very friendly
  last night i had been craving for fish and chips so i went to jack in the box to get my fix sadly they discontinued that item the next morning i had yelped around to look for places to eat and stumbled across this place the name of the restaurant had it all fish and chips i ordered the cod fish with regular fries and was a bit skeptical because the price was a bit higher than my normal fish and chips at jack in the box but the flaky soft tender taste of the cod made me realize that this is what fish and chips should taste like not the old soggy greasy fish at jacks the fried to were a delightful surprise made with whole potatoes and seasoned perfectly the hush puppies along with the cole slaw topped the overall meal customer service was also an a overall i gave this place a 5 star for their great food customer service and the little extras that gives your meal a variety of taste
  in vegas gir the week and reviews once again led me yo a hole in the wall w great food the bolognese was full of flavor and the pasta was al dente perfect all in all the service was good and we had a great dining experience i would go back if i was the repetitive diner i like new things everytime so on to the next
  i love jojo s i ve made it a regular eat the food is amazing and they have the best wings i ve ever tasted the pizza cookie is also great
  i got a skillet breakfast that was awesome i d definitely recommend this lace for anyone looking for a weekend brunch the service was fairly quick food was plentiful and while you re here don t forget to pick up desert to go we got a strawberry rhubarb pie and a raspberry pie both where a hit after dinner and the next morning one heads up the waitress never mentioned it but you pay at the front we spent a few minutes waiting for someone to take our payment before heading up to the front to ask
  three stars because of nostalgia monical s has always been around as long as i can remember this location is probably the one i am familiar with the most because i use to live a few block from here when i was a kid pizza is average thin crust in little squares that is pretty soggy the family pleaser is what we always get which just adds an iceburg lettuce salad and soft drinks to a pizza order nothing bad but nothing great either
  i love blueberry hill everything about it i do not think i have ever had a bad experience at this one off of flamingo and maryland i have been there with 10 people and for such a small kind of place they have always found space for us to sit together i made friends with one of the older waitresses she is adorable i have never waited a ridiculous amount of time for my food one i came in at 9 15am had my food at 9 20 give or take a minute it was so fast it is inexpensive and open 24 hours as a college student it is perfect for those late night cravings of some good french toast or anything really when my family comes into town there is no doubt that when asked where do they want to eat this weekend blueberry hill duh at least once they have to eat there when they are in town its awesome they have deals all the time too i had french toast eggs and bacon for 5 99 but it was the before 11am special i think thats pretty cheap and it is way way way better then denny s even though i can t hate on denny s too much on another visit it was a busy saturday but the folks i was with we had sat there and was walking for 3 hours and not once did they ask us to move or hurry up and leave when we finished eating 2 hours before it was nice to just be able to sit there and converse with your friends and not being pushed away because they needed the tables for others they are pretty quick at getting tables cleaned and ready to go for the next guests as soon as the previous ones have left i have never waited more than 20min even when the parking lot was full and cars had to start parking on the street great environment great food and the best french toast ever so far
  this place is a lot better than woo che bbq a similar korean bbq place just across the street i ve been to woo che plenty of times but i think i have a new favorite my favorite food items were the kalbi and the clams sushi was pretty good also their meats looked fresh and the chefs kept bringing out more stuff i even spilled some sauce on the counter as one of them were watching me i said sorry and i got a reassuring smile and he said it was just fine wipes forehead i didn t like it when one of the servers just turned off our grill he didn t even ask if we were done that was odd i had to find another server to turn it back on minus 1 star for that also don t be afraid to order the water it does not take gross at all i like it b c it doesn t take away from the flavor of the meat i would definitely go here again even though it was packed it didn t matter the great atmosphere and awesome food makes me happy
  so run don t walk to this quaint local bar and eatery that has delicious food and a great happy hour i stumbled upon this urban and modern but comfortable establishment thursday march 27th ready for a drink and bite to eat this place delivered that and more we started with a lite beer kronenbourg 1664 for um 2 00 yes 2 00 moved on to the bruschetta beer braised pork butt and it was great then we tried the arancini risotto balls even better we were getting full but everyone was getting a pizza so we decided to try the margherita pizza and it was heaven the chicken chopped salad was awesome as well can t rave more about this place please check them out they will be adding outdoor seating by the summer and i can t wait to sit outside by the fountain and try some of their other menu items our server ralph was very informative and the owner stopped by to check on us as well what a great place we ll be back soon
  these two stars are basically for ambiance and fantastic food service is average at best pool is free but the only thing more broken than the pool sticks is the pool tables themselves the beer selection is the worst for someone who values good beer thank you but if my elite choice is a magic hat 9 even being with in walking distance to my house and the choice for my gambling induced friends i would never go here and rarely do
  ok now granted it s been two years but the reason i m doing this review is more for myself than anything i m trying to organize all my favorite eating places and by reviewing them i have a place where i can log in to remember them what i can offer although it has been a while is that the tortas were always very good my ex girlfriend turned me onto them and i discovered how hard it is to find good tortas mexican sandwich basically pita bread asada rice onions the tortas here are very good even for a low rent food joint like robertos it s cheap eating at it s best even though in vegas you have a multitude of options this is a place where you can get good mexican tortas for quite cheap it was always our place to go when we wanted to eat off the strip get in and get out hope this helps
  i really like bj s food is great but service is kind of slow it s like they don t have enough employees the guy that served our table was great but you can tell he was overworked by having way too many tables we placed our order and we ended not getting our appetizer just because it was simply too many customers and not enough help i felt bad for him and tried not to make any requests i hope they hire more people soon
  want a nice hearty breakfast the try this place from breakfast pizza to cincy chili spaghetti you are sure to find something on the menu you will love if you are in the mood for a meat lovers omelet try the three piggy omelet it is packed with ham bacon and sausage and it is delicious the coffee is amazing and the service is great if you are coming here on a saturday or sunday make sure to expect a wait of up to 30 minutes because the place is always packed a testament of how awesome it is
  i was looking forward to going to carefree station we found out about this restaurant from a friend we thought it would be a nice place to bring our daughter for her graduation so here is the review my wife and i went to check out the restaurant for lunch to see if we would like to return for dinner with the rest of the family in short no the setting of the restaurant is nice enough to say it could be so much more then it is we asked to sit inside and the place was less then 1 4 full we were told we could sit on the covered patio ummm why ok we sat on the covered patio but would have much preferred inside our style of dining is un rushed they got that so kudos on that we ordered 2 lunch entrees and they arrived presented very well the eyes were pleased the eyes were pleased the palate was like the street the restaurant is located on ho hum more then anything else the restaurant needs an identity make up their mind as to what they are going to do it misses the mark by a long way in this area next use the suroundings to better serve the purpose lastly the desserts were not good at all alot of hype with no substance i wsh it were better sorry cfs
  i m very surprised at the quantity of low reviews for this place as i think it has the best sushi in the city and is one of my favorite restaurants in pittsburgh yes it is pricey but i think it s safe to assume that the quality and freshness of fish here is a little bit higher than the stuff you see at your local giant eagle i definitely suggest trying the wasabi tobiko 4 per piece such a unique piece of sushi and one of the reasons i ve been counting down the days until my next visit to umi
  probably one of my favorite pizza places in vegas good food nice service warm atmosphere may be a little busy during happy hour and on the weekends but its worth the wait
  very delicious veggie dishes for everyone in our family we came here for dinner and were extremely pleased with the level of spiciness and the overall flavor not too salty like dishes in some other indian restaurants will definitely come back
  yummy food many choices of iced tea reusable cups with discounts and fairly decent prices i like that it s an order at the counter type place and the seating atmosphere feels like a regular sit down restaurant i had the mama s broiled tomato panini with pasta salad on the side it was reeeeally good i have no complaints it was flavorful and filling i also drank about 5 full cups of iced tea while my boyfriend and i played scrabble so i was perfectly happy with my food and drink my boyfriend had a slightly less satisfactory experience he ordered a coffee with his meal and the guy behind the counter said he d have to brew some ok so we waited for our food to be ready and 10 minutes later my boyfriend went back up to get his coffee not only was it cold but it was also extremely watered down i don t know what happened but apparently the staff here don t know how to brew coffee the guy was nice about it and just gave us another regular drink but still how is it even possible to mess coffee up that badly za s isn t in a particularly convenient location for me to visit it very frequently but i m sure i ll find some excuse to come back i want another one of those broiled tomato paninis
  great little sushi place i enjoy the atmosphere as much as the fresh delicious fish courteous and caring service
  i m no expert when it comes to mexican food but i do eat out often and work in the hospitality industry i enjoy eating here but the service has been very slow personally i think it s because of their subway style of assembly line there s no reason to have to speak to three different people for a to go order the prices are high for fast food mexican i don t think they want to be known as fast food especially since it s somewhat slow and made to order but there is an uneasy feeling when the warm meat portion of your entree is sitting on the vegetable line for a few minutes before the next employee is ready to ask you what you re having even though you already ordered seems monotonous once my fire grilled steak sat for a couple of minutes the next assembly line employee asked what i was having even though i already ordered i realized the quickest option was to tell her however it comes still didn t matter as they were behind on orders i came to a third employee who asked what my order was apparently they work on the honor system this gentleman seemed to be the only employee with a sense of urgency he attempted to get caught up on multiple orders that were well behind the ticket time no one else seemed to care or understand i hope he gets promoted to management they need it there 3 stars for the average food would love to have it made to order as advertised 4th star for the one person who understood urgency and hospitality
  considering the crappy service we received elsewhere we ended up eating at margaritaville twice during our trip we had great service both times and i was pleased with the food the first time i had a bbq turkey burger which was really good normally turkey burgers can be on the dry side but it was really moist and tasteful the second time i got the mahi mahi and it was amazing i really enjoyed the meals there and the drinks were great
  server was so friendly and actually engaged in conversation the food was great and my scorpion shot went down so smoothly i asked for the biggest scorpion they had and they delivered i would like to personally thank zach our server for being super attentive and just all around a great server will definitely come back and most definitely will recommend to all of my friends thank you nacho daddy for turning around a bad day with your awesomeness
  just amazing food and service what else can you say we love this place so much i had the salmon which was excellent
  went to this place last night it s attached to a strip club which is a little disconcerting but the place once entered through its own entrance was fine it was our first time here and came on a recommendation sat down and the chips and salsa was good i was looking forward to the meal as usually if the salsa is good the food is good in this case they bring red and green fire roasted salsas i ordered the pozole what a disappointment it was greasy very salty and the chips that came with it covered the onion and cabbage they didn t bring lime so used the ones from my beer tried to skim as much grease as i could into a plastic container they brought with the pozole but it wasn t very good another person ordered the milanesa torta and returned it because it was dry and over salted another person in our group ordered a shrimp bowl with brown rice but it came with the cilantro llime white rice won t go back
  if you re in search of spicy chinese food this place is for you we tried a few other places and this place won by a mile if you like dan dan noodles you will love this place also the intestine pot was amazing it comes with potatoes okra garlic cilantro and cucumber this place tastes amazing give it a try especially if you like hunan or sichuan food
  best burger place in phoenix my favorite burger recipe is the potato bun chicken pesto green peppers blue cheese lettuce tomato and guacamole side of ranch for the onion rings oh and almost forgot the fish tacos are the best i had in a while im so lucky to live not far from it bring all your friends
  update solid 4 5 stars have gone back 7 or 8 times total and after my review mentioning the alternate strips they have served nothing but the good ones maybe they had to use a different source that one day or i got a bad batch or whatever but since then the strips have been primo and everything there is fresh and fried heaven go try it you ll like it
  i have been here several times and have never had a bad meal all of there food is simply consistently good the mixed grain salad with chicken is one of my favorites but i also love the chiken salad sandwich the burger and the reuban now i just need to make it there in time for brunch thank you windsor many pleasant experiences
  this place pleasantly surprised me it reminds me of a spot from my hometown and has a greek style menu my mom had the gyro burger and i got a bite it was so good i had the patty melt and it was very good i wish they would serve a cup of soup with the meal like other diners do but the portion of fries is enough to fill you up prices are 8 9 a person service coulda been faster but it was worth the slow waiter
  fresh sushi and great customer service i had a great experience and i will definately come back soon
  big portions friendly staff and they always give you something complimentary with each order egg rolls crab puffs drinks what s not to like not to mention their service is fast and always fresh this is my go to spot for chinese food in central phoenix
  i have always wanted to eat here a review i read said this place was dingy however far from it very clean homey and service was great but the meal was blah both my husband and i had lobster filet lobster was bland filet chewy gristly for the it s totally not worth it i left half my meal on the plate very disappointing
  crust is awesome good flavor in sauce too definitely recommend getting all the crust toppers pizza reheats great also if you have any left over
  azn is a stunning restaurant with an ambience that is welcoming and elegant we dined al fresco and ordered a variety of items from the ample menu each of our dishes was perfectly prepared and presented and delicious our server was thorough the right mix of friendly and efficient and very pleasant the portions were ample and each dish was a palate pleaser i loved the friend shrimp dish and the special babyback ribs our sushi was excellent i live in san francisco a sushi town one of the big pluses is that you ine in a setting where you can hear your companions and never have to yell to be heard if i lived in charlotte i d eat at azn every opportunity i had and it will be stop 1 when i return
  this was one of the best places we ate in vegas the prices were actually reasonable i pause for a moment for the shock to settle in yes reasonable food prices in vegas and it wasn t crowded for dinner the place is a little confused about whether it s a sit down restaurant or an order at the counter joint but the manger tried very hard to please and came over a few times to make sure everything was alright my sandwich was delicious and so was my wife s the chocolate cake for dessert was warmed up for us and absolutely delicious and dairy free i would definitely go back here on a return trip and recommend the restaurant to veganites and non vegans alike
  i love the chicken dip it in the hummus the hummus with the spice sauce super delicious the date cookies are fabulous the service five star
  the best fried chicken in town i ordered beef tips w rice mac and cheese collards and a side of fried chicken yummy in my tummy i ve been in charlotte 20 years and never tasted chicken like theirs do yaself a favor and order a side of chicken lol
  omg the pastor tacos are amazingggggg i can t wait to eat here again before i go home to la it s sooooo good you won t regret it
  came here since it was on man vs food to try the food and see how it is i ordered the jewish sliders that were made famous as on the show and boy was it good i seriously can t explain just how amazing this plate is wish i lived in arizona just to eat here i didn t get a chance to try their bakery but it looks like it is really good and worth a stop it definitely hit the spot beef brisket and a potato pancake sliders yes please must have meal original jewish sliders
  the menu is interesting there were some good ideas this place is actually trying not just doing the tried and true eggs and bacon crap i got the sirloin burger forget what its called old town burger something for breakfast they had to double check to make sure but they say they usually do the lunch items for breakfast upon request it had horseradish mayo and coleslaw as well as the typical lettuce and tomato very good another great idea you can get half sweet potato and half plain fries as a side variety potato or something it was just perfect for me because its such a battle choosing between the two and then halfway through i wish i had some of the other variety my friend got the steak omelet not bad not too much you can do with that i guess i was so excited about my breakfast that i didn t pay much attention to it but the proportions were surprisingly good for the price the menu items look fancy but the prices are pretty average so one would assume the portions will compensate and be just right think cafe zu zu but i was happy with the portions at this place i will likely return when i m in the mood for something special that s not too crazy
  love the hawaiian spicy tuna roll the 1st time i tried this place i was craving for more delicious the people there are friendly happy to help let s just say they got that crack sushi keep you coming back for more
  in tempe for a triathlon and needing to carb load with some pasta i found this place on yelp it was about two miles from my hotel and the reviews here were good enough for me to check it out it s a perfectly fine mid range family oriented italian restaurant when i dine alone i take a book so i always request a quiet corner booth the hostess gave me the best that they had as it was a crowded busy saturday night there was a chatty family at the adjacent table but they left halfway into my dinner i had a veal piccatta fettucini alfredo a moretti beer and a glass of the house chianti hot italian bread came out immediately and it was excellent the salad was uninspired just iceberg lettuce with a few garnishes the blue cheese dressing was great though being thick and chunky the pasta and veal were perfectly cooked and i was given a bowl of parmesan cheese which went great with the pasta the tab 30 before tip for bread salad entree a beer and a glass of wine the food was excellent and the ambiance is very nice reading the other reviews that complain about riazzi s having dated decor i don t agree the floral patterns in the booth are appropriate the only thing that i thought could stand an improvement was the chairs they re quite worn and i remember seeing the same chairs in a pizzaria in the 70 s but it s not a big deal this is a very nice reasonably priced italian place with excellent food and great ambiance
  this rock bottom is awful a poor example of an already poor chain what s comical is that we came here with gift certificates we got from the manager of the desert ridge location after our food came out cold after a 45 minute wait we figured maybe another location would be better dead wrong i don t know if the food was an improvement because we went on a saturday afternoon and waited a full 5 minutes inside before being acknowledged and seated the place was deserted and we sat at our table for another 10 minutes before being approached by a waiter reeking of cigarette smoke i guess this restaurant is being run by 1 or 2 people i wouldn t be surprised if the hostess was back in the kitchen ready to cook our order we didn t wait around to find out i eventually took my gift certificates to the scottsdale location and blew them all on beer and filet mignon before they expired but that s a different review
  sometimes you buy a groupon and then you accidentally don t use it your first try so you come back that happens it happened with my two visits to la santisima i d say they know what they re doing the offer some dishes that were new to me lonches for one i know what lonche is in spanglish practice but what_a_ lonche is was news to me and it was good news all around the food was good salsas are even better i did order horchata my first time but i ve totally forgotten what that was like that seems to have happened to much of what happened during my first year on the job this isn t the only thing i ve forgotten i ve blocked out a lot apparently the service was fine i ve never seen the place hoping but maybe the weekend dinner crowd is bashful or something our water cups stayed pretty full and our server was otherwise attentive the wait for food was never long cost was fine it is a gourmet taco shop after all so you get what you pay for portions are not huge and style comes with a cost the decor is lovely i could steal some of their paintings for home i like them so much that is if they weren t so darn big i d likely give it another visit that is if we re in glendale downtown just walking around or something it seems to be one of the best options
  love postino central the bruschetta is delicious and the atmosphere is great too
  great atmosphere good draft selection their burgers are very good my favorite is their home made boneless wings they would just melt in your mouth i tried their philly salad but it was ok more on the greasy side
  i ve recently returned here after have a very good experience only to be let down i came in for lunch and ordered the pad thai like last time the seafood tasted old and on top of that the service was slow and lackadaisical there were probably only three other people there they need to step it up and stick to their standards i had a very good first impression of this place now its barely mediocre
  seriously four tiny pieces in the 14 yellow tail ceviche ripp off
  been there a few times and never had a bad taco flavor combinations are amazing the pork belly taco is the best taco i have ever had
  ambiance whenever i am near citynorth i sigh sadly and wonder what can i do to get people to bring some business to north phoenix this little gourmet hamburger spot is one of those places that give me hope for citynorth fun menu and beautiful interior warm tones darn brown on gold and love the fab wall paper the menu reminds me of delux burger in phoenix i had a grilled sirloin burger with a fried egg and bbq sauce very fun combo though i didn t ask for cheese they put cheese on it so that would be my only complaint the skinny fries were great
  i m a huge bbq fan love the location but the brisket was literally all fat couldn t even eat it
  had the grilled italian with hot peppers sandwich was delicious i like spicy but my mouth was on fire and a single bottle of water wasn t enough the only thing i don t like about this place is drink situation sucks is it too much to have a drink dispenser or iced tea my wife had just a regular turkey sandwich and it was delicious with real pieces of turkey can t wait to try something new on menu
  great burger place everything is made to order and they do not have a microwave or a freezer they make the burgers by hand and homemade french fries are to die for but don t forget to ask for their specially made fry sauce i had the impala burger and my hubby had the cobra both burgers were amazing don t miss out on awesome burgers the owners chefs were fun and friendly as well thanks jake and bruce i will be back for more
  i gave this place 3 stars because of our waitress she was so rude completely rushed us what i actually liked about this restaurant bar was the turkey burger and raffle on game day we didn t win but it was still fun they also offer a combo of a drink and a shot for just 12 which is cheap in vegas
  i had such a lovely experience here from beginning to end my 2 children ate free and loved their fish meal we got delicious burgers and lemonade and to finish it off a free and oh so yummy chocolate chip cookie you must go here
  tried this place for the first time with my mom and girlfriend and it is awesome ordered the spring rolls and the dumplings as appetizers and they are great then for the entrees we had red curry with beef and the rama also great dishes the presentation of the food was also very well done quiet place and the service was good definitely a must try
  this is the place i go to religiously when i m feeling like eating healthy being a pesceterian i frequently get meat cravings and green is the place i run to their mock chicken is delicious tasted just like real chicken and their version of the big mack the big wack is even tastier than the real thing from what i can remember i absolutely recommend the spicy peanut chicken salad it is so filling and full of flavor to whoever judges vegan food as cardboard like and tasteless needs to try green i have gotten several of my omnivorous friends to try this place and they have all loved the food and the atmosphere its very artsy fartsy inside and when you walk in you immediately feel the positive vibes bouncing off all the healthy people inside its really really nice overall the location is a little hidden but nevertheless when you find the place you will always go back stay green
  first time there highly recommended by my nephew who lives in las vegas my experience from when we walked in the door was very cordial and friendly there was a waiting line as usual as i was told and the wait was about 30 mins i m so glad we waited and the setting was local and i felt comfortable arpi our waitress was awsome she s friendly and smiles of which all the restaurants we went to in the 6 days in vegas i rate her the highest she visited hawaii and knows our slangs and made us laugh the all you can eat menu is huge and very fast service water soda was always refilled and the attention from the bus help to the other waitresses was professional i highly recommend this local restaurant to everyone looking for a sushi bar and i will be back there in november when i attend the sema show
  we have eaten here several times as we live in the neighborhood had dinner there just the other night and had to write a review in short this is the kind of cooking that made me want to be a chef when i was a younger person truly creative beautifully expressive engaging yes those are some pretty tall words for a restaurant review but truly fine food should be an experience and grit grace delivers that in spades first the cocktails they don t make as big a deal about it as say tender in lawrenceville which makes some seriously good cocktails but i would say that their gin and tonic is right up there with the best of the new old cocktail trend you will never think of a gin and tonic the same way again next the dim sum this is part of their theme and it really works they have my favorite kimchi in all the land maybe not as funky as the best authentic kimchi but fresh tasty spiced very well constantly good and delicious they have a soba noodle and smoked tofu dim sum that is also excellent noodles cooked perfectly great layering of flavors beautiful tofu did he just say beautiful tofu yes he did if you ve seen my review of nine on nine you know how i feel about restaurants serving lame vegetarian dishes grit grace serves unapologetically excellent vegetarian dishes and that s how it should be done a restaurant should never say we re serving this dish because you don t eat meat they should say we re serving this dish because it s truly great tasting btw it doesn t have meat in it the pork rillette sp dimsum is also beautiful so good in fact that you re veggie friends can just eat the greens and pickled veg and have a terrific experience if they re not hung up on letting you eat the pork rillette which is yummy for dinner we had the seafood sausage and their ramen dish with pork belly and 5 minute egg the seafood sausage was one of the best plates i ve seen and enjoyed in a long long time beautifully layered flavors and if i could get that sausage in the market it would be in the cart ever week the ramen was equally good with a fantastic broth and perfectly cooked ramen and the star of the ramen dish the marinated shitake and the triangle of seaweed on the side of the bowl no kidding again beautifully layered dish where each component brings something to make the dish more interesting not just more complicated i m looking at you cure in case you were wondering the smoked pork belly was also great just not in a way that was so unexpected portion sizes are perfect as well just a little on the small side so you re satisfied without being fatigued with the dimsum beforehand it s just right now i ve given 5 stars because i don t think you can serve food that s this truly interesting and not get the recognition that that deserves but all is not perfect at grist grace their front of house has always been a bit wobbly in our experience just a bit not quite right and for a restaurant that has the dim sum thing as such an important part of their overall theme it s a bit surprising how long it can take for the first round to make its way to the table the dim sum dishes are cold so but with that in mind go there it s definitely among the very best of the burgh
  this place is terrific we have been here 5 6 times now and have tried many dishes all are very good they have a great happy hour from 3 7 and belly dancing on friday and saturday nights if you like indian cuisine or have never tried it give this place a shot
  super chill place to hang with friends staff is friendly and quick sometime beer can be a little colder for me but everyone is different don t make my comment of chilled beer stop you from going to try wob out oh and the pretzel is to dye for
  nice dinner good atmosphere and good italian food chic parm for me three kids under age of 7 and it was really nice
  i would want to give this place another go before finalizing my opinion i thought the atmosphere was very cute country feeling for dinner i ordered the swordfish 27 honestly i thought it was okay not the great as tripple george downtown but up there my friend ordered a pizza it was cooked perfectly the service was pretty good but the hostest seemed a bit overwhelmed at times would visit again
  we had an awesome time eating here we didn t have a reservation but they took us as a walk in and we sat in the back i always feel like you get the best experience sitting at the sushi bar all of the workers are so nice and our server was very polite and knowledgable of the menu the sushi chefs were so nice and made convo with us throughout dinner which i thought was neat as for our meals i got water with cucumber to start off because i was feeling a little dehydrated i tried one of their rolls which i hadn t had before and i was kinda skeptical about it it was like kyuki or something like that it is amazing i also had a bowl of miso soup and it was really cool because the soup comes clear with the tofu and seaweed and you get to mix in your own miso which turns it a tan color my dinner date got a kieren beer and a seaweed salad and omg the seaweed salad was amazing the dressing that was used was delicious and the seaweed was nice with a great texture for his course he got the mahi mahi on a bed of rice and it too was scrumptious this was probably my favorite yummiest dining experience in vegas the layout of the restaurant is so cool i couldn t stop talking about it but our server the sushi chefs and the food all made my experience 5 stars i will return and i can not wait
  the food quality is average the portions are large and the service was on point my friend and i went in for lunch and it was super busy which usually is a good sign we were seated only with a short wait but the wait for our food took a pretty long time it didn t really bother us as it was expected but the server brought our check and said goodbye before we were even half way done with our food she told us not to rush and we re looking at each other like uhhh we wont you took your time bringing us the food and we are going to take our time eating it she had the tuna which was pretty bland so she had to add some hot sauce to it our fries were tiny which we weren t really a fan of either but my cheeseburger was pretty good
  large healthy portions at a moderate price the kobe burger was over done from what we ordered and did not taste like kobe the jumbo shrimp were truly jumbo and tasted great the onion rings were fantastic fast friendly service clean establishment
  i came here really wanting to love this place unfortunately i was very disappointed the food was absolutely terrible we ordered 5 different meals and all of them were mediocre if not gross especially the omelet the service however was great they were busy and we were well taken care of in a timely fashion the planes there were so cool i have three sons under 8 and they all had a great time we sat outside and they loved watching the planes take off as we ate breakfast you also get the opportunity to walk around and check the parked planes out which my sons also loved we may be back to check out the planes since we live down the street but we won t be staying to eat
  i frequent vegas all the time but this was my first time at off the strip it was a pleasant surprise we stopped by for brunch and the meat lover s omelette was delicious most importantly there are 6 7 specialty bloody marys to choose from they were well done and intense they went heavy on the seasoning for sure so be ready for that we came back at around 1 am for their happy hour and oh man the 20 oz ribeye steak deal was the best that steak almost brought us to tears it was the perfect midnight snack after a long night of partying and gambling we will definitely be coming back
  my girl loved the garlic chicken plate rice was a bit hard maybe old aaight mac salad i had the pepper salmon crunch roll house poke i really enjoyed it wanted fresh malasadas got microwaved old malasadas that was sitting under heat lamp it would have been better fresh
  great food great price excellent service the dinner selections are delish we go weekly and have tried them all my favorite eggplant rollatini and the antipasto is fabulous pizza is just like new york excellent super clean and friendly we are regulars
  this is a very nice and classy place to my amazement they didn t even blink an eye when walked in with our plastic guitars filled with super gross margarita mix tofu was great but our favorite was the salmon roe uni and poached egg dish surf and surf and turf but with eggs the texture is a little slimy so be warned if your have one of those picky eaters in the group i am a big fan
  my first visit here with the family was quite good it was evening and it was crowded we had to wait at the bar for a table so we enjoyed a cocktail in the electric sports themed lounge with tvs in every direction service was pretty quick my wife tried one of their signature concoctions called an upper manhattan which is basically a manhattan with peach puree she loved it and it s become one of her regular libations once seated our server was very friendly and efficient our food arrived reasonably quickly and we all enjoyed what we ordered i left on a positive note and looked forward to a return visit which happened about a week ago our second visit was during the restaurant dead hour just before 3 pm and happy hour we opted for an outside table which was nice despite the occasional disruptive breezes i ordered a cocktail a regular manhattan which i specified but apparently the young server was unfamiliar with this classic so i eventually received an upper which is a tad too sweet for me i say eventually because it took a very long time to get my drink and after the arrived the waiter was no where to be found so i had to bring it back into the bar to ask the bartender what it was he confirmed it was an upper but he cheerfully agreed to make me a standard manhattan which was returned to our table liquidity split we placed our lunch order and regretfully like my cocktail it took forever to arrive if it hadn t been for the positive experience during our first visit i might have downgraded my rating to 3 stars but i know what this establishment is capable of so i presume the slowness in service was due to the hour of the day and changing of shifts i will say that our food was equally delectable as our initial visit i would definitely return here again but i would be more careful about the time of day for my next visit
  great food was eating burgers the last couple of days and it was great to find this place love the food and had good spice to it i order pork fried rice and pan fried dumplings gotta try the ramen or soups next time it looks like it was curing some hangovers at the next table
  surprisingly good we live in the area and kept seeing the name of this place wasn t exactly sure what jumping rice was so we always drove by it then we got a menu in one of the local papers and saw all the great menu items so we decided to have lunch there the other day very clean modern and peaceful decor we were happy to see the brown rice option so we ordered the jumping rice basically fried rice with beef and you can add extra meat for another 2 and make a fairly healthy protein packed meal there were lots of egg and veggie bits and very flavorful generous portion as well they also gave a miniscule free sample of their corn salad and omg soooooo good have to get that next time friendly and quick service we will definitely be going back
  i love sushi and frequently eat it and i have to say this is one of the best sushi restaurants i have ever eaten the all you can eat is very well priced also my favorite was the sashimi salad it was so different the sauce was tangy sweet sour spicy all the flavors just burst into your mouth when you eat the sashimi it makes you salivate like none other it is amazing if you ever go to las vegas yama sushi is one of the places you have to go before going back home
  never again we had our choice of restaurants and chose this one over 5 others in the miracle mile mall horrible food we were sat down right away and then went for our food i could not finish one item and tried many we wanted to order drinks but our server must have finished his shift and never saw him again our plates and the plates of other customers piled up and nobody was clearing again the food was really bad save you money and go somewhere else i would not eat here again even if it was free which it was this time
  met a friend for breakfast here service was good it is an eat n park denny s type of place so if you enjoy those kinds of places you will love drew s i ordered the farmers omelette and my friend had the corned beef hash and eggs the big plate full of cbh was made from scratch and not canned delicious per my friend my omelette was ok because it was the farmers and had some potatoes in it i did not receive any hash browns just a couple of slices of small toast a great place would have included some fresh fruit to fill the platter but not drew s just a small burrito sized omelette in the middle of a big platter
  bomb dot com don t ask questions don t read reviews just go have fun stay thirsty my friends
  we recently wandered in here on a whim and were not disappointed we split the appetizer platter that included hummus baba ganoush tabouli red tabouli grape leaves and pita fantastic my boyfriend had the iraqi kabob while i enjoyed the shwarma plate bothe were wonderful great location close to home with delicious food and very affordable
  the food was very good we had the whole hog split between four people and the meat was more than enough the sides are small portions probably the amount one person would get for meal i did not like the st louis ribs they were a bit dry for my taste however my brother and dad said they were ok the baby back ribs were delicious they fell right off the bone and were moist the brisket was also much better than the st louis ribs they charge extra to get bread to use with the pulled pork
  mmm pizza we were looking for a good pizza place in vegas on yelp and came across rosati s since it was nearby we bought their double dough pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms for pick up and it was ready in a flash opened the pizza box up when we got home and bam a very huge pizza with very huge crusts the crust was super good actually the double dough pizza literally felt like there were two pizza slices in one so i was full off of a slice the tomato sauce was really light and there was lots of cheese the prices were decent and the service was friendly i was so full from one slice that i had a food coma after
  we were here for breakfast it started out a little weird because the seating host was missing in action we hovered for a few mins and she appeared the waitress was very attentive overall the service is good i got a waffle with berries and marscapone cream cheese was cooked perfectly the hashed browns were delicious and we also got an omelette that was good overall the meal was good nothing outstanding but a nice change of pace is you want somewhere quiet to start your day
  we almost bailed on this place because of the ny reviewers below but realized they had posted on like every possible reviewing site and were soooo angry that we decided they had some personal vendetta towards the restaurant to go through the process of posting the same complaint to sooo many sites thinking of how many people eat there every evening and theirs being the worst review led us to roll the dice we had heard about this from the andrew zimmern montreal episode but when i tried making reservations over a month out it kept giving me an option beyond our travel dates a few days before we left i tried calling and to my surprise they offered us a late evening reservation we were excited on the day of we actually ended up arriving almost 45 minutes early figured we would walk around if they wouldn t take us but they quickly led us to our table the restaurant was busy but not as tight fitting as some of these reviews had led me to believe we were greeted by an informative waitress who quickly switched to english to deal with us sadly for her it seemed every table that came in after us in her section was american so i felt bad for her as most tables struggled to read the chalkboard menu and needed extensive help we were crazy enough to bring our teen daughters along but she was sweet and patient with us as we had her make recommendations we decided to have the girls try sea whelk which they were hesitant about but ended up loving then based on a recommendation went with the rib steak for 2 to split among the four of us as our main entree we are soooo lucky we only got that because the rib steak was so big that even with all 4 of us having some we actually ended up leaving two slices of the meat that we couldn t finish the meat was very flavorful and each of us loved it it came with a smoked sausage that was wonderful the only complaint was the main dish came with a side that was a baked celery root and it was sooooo salty we could not eat it overall a great experience
  best pizza ever been their customer forever pick up estimated time is like 12minutes and you can beat that great customer service great ingredients and great pizza joint thank you marco s
  we so wanted to love this place cool space great menu decent drink list but ultimately if the food is just average it s not going to make it we shared a kale salad had all the fix ins for a good salad but they used the wrong kind of kale it s hard to stomach literally a salad made of curly kale dino kale is a much better choice for a kale salad i had the artichoke hearts which had an awesome crispy parmesan gremalota but unfortunately the artichokes were blah no meat on them at all it could have been a contender my husband had the turkey meatball sliders below average seriously who doesn t love kings hawaiian bread but it takes more than that to make a great slider would have been great if the chef had been a bit more creative perhaps a teriaki meatball with some sort of mango chutney instead it was just a boring turkey meatball again love the space but they are going to have to up the ante if they hope to stay in business
  we tried the shrimp and fish tacos you get to put the toppings on your tacos after he makes them to order the sauces are all home made loved the avocado cilantro as good as it gets everything is made fresh
  i never thought i d be giving my go to sushi joint 2 stars but alas i am it s sad but true over the past year i ve watched sakana slip i m not sure what happened to the little neighborhood sushi place that was once authentic last night was the last straw like always i ordered a house salad that at one time was chalk full of tomatoes fresh sliced mushrooms and a delightful ginger dressing this was not the case last night there was one sliced tomato and no mushrooms the gingery dressing that i once loved has now been converted into the salty orange mess i tried to eat it but after i felt the taste buds in my mouth disintegrating from sodium overload i stopped next came the sushi we ordered 3 different rolls soft shell crab tootsie and a spicy tuna they were all wrapped so loose that it made it next to impossible to eat with chopsticks i hate when i see people eating sushi with their hands but last night i was one of those people i tasted one of the spicy tuna rolls and decided it was best not eat another one it tasted fishy and anyone sushi eater knows that when fish tastes fishy its bad news on a good note the server was very nice she took spicy tuna off the bill since we had only consumed one she also offered free dessert but we declined and left i hate to say it but i will probably not return oh and did i mention we also had the pleasure of listening to justin bieber while we dined if i wanted to hang around sake bombing 19 year olds i would have gone to ra sorry sakana
  this is my go to spot for hawaiian food the portions are enormous no way i can finish everything in one sitting i end up sharing with someone or eating half i love their teriyaki steak teriyaki chicken furikake chicken i really really love the furikake chicken i can t believe i ve never tried this amazing style of chicken where have you been all my life other favorites are poke macaroni salad and spam musubi i have a sick addiction to their guava cake which i heard they get from the bakery next to them it s one of my favorite cakes and i find myself thinking about this cake often some of the dishes i didn t care for are the korean chicken wings galbi i m picky with korean chicken wings and galbi i m not a big pork lover so i don t usually order pork dishes but my husband enjoys them definitely a good choice to stop by to satisfy your hawaiian food cravings
  another great visit this time for lunch service was fast and everyone very friendly plus the food was delicious ordered tacos and chips with queso will definitely be back again
  i finally dined here for the first time on sunday and it seems like a nice place has a nice homely feel to it and the menu has many choices service was good and they also have a bar area to sit at as well i had a hard time deciding what to get so i went with the chicken fingers appitizer portions were good and service was nice i would feel safe taking my parents here or a friend for a nice quiet meal
  i went with my friends for brunch new years and this place was nicely packed the wait wasn t that long i ordered the whole hog omelette and it was good and meaty it was a huge portion size i couldn t finish the whole thing the bar harbour flapjacks were really delicious too with their berry puree to top it off my friend got the bird the other omelette i was thinking about ordering and he gave me a taste of it and i knew i should have ordered that it was really good i ll be sure to order that next time i go there
  sooo yummy will definitely go again and the service is quick and friendly a must try
  i like corned beef hash and breakfest in general so i had to try this place out on saturday s i like to eat a hearty meal after hitting the weights in the morning and i go to aloha kitchen in the same plaza i ve seen this place before but never tried it but finally i did this past saturday i had the traditional corned beef hash two eggs over easy and you get two sides i chose their country potatos and toast since i haven t been there before i guess i made the right choice with their toast because their jelly jams seem to be their main draw they have a huge selection that they bring for you to choose from i had apple butter rasberry and peach they were all good the corned beef hash looks different redish and chopped into ultra small bits i like mine to be a bit meatier but this was both different and good i ll try and post a picture of it so you can check it out my current favorite for corned beef hash is weiss deli in henderson and it still remains tops i like this place and it seems to be family run a few people came in and mistook it for hash house a go go it s also next to a smoke shop and some even thought they could score some good hashish in here they too were wrong j k
  i ate at the culinary dropout last night and i will totally come back the restaurant has a great modern atmosphere and live music 3 times a week i ordered the butternut squash cannelloni and i was very happy with my decision it was filling but not too heavy and the butternut squash was a sweet alternative to traditional cheese the staff was very helpful and polite overall 5 stars
  very authentic i was kind of scared to go in because it looks out of place where it is but i was very impressed with the food the pupusas are huge for only 1 75
  the fusion tacos and fusion burritos are very tasty my son is very picky but he loves their orange chicken great food huge portions awesome prices what more can you ask for small family operated restaurant and they make you feel like a member of their family if you open a komex in orange county i ll never have to cook again
  my husband and i went to this restaurant during the past holidays needless to say given jean george s reputations we had very high expectations i mean after all jean george is a celebrity chef we picked out a couple of the restaurant s signature steak dishes and an appetizer my steak was cooked ok but my husband s was overcooked he had asked for medium rare another thing that we find strange was that we were served with 4 different sauces to go with our steaks for us this was the first because we had never been served any type of sauces in any high end steakhouse high quality steaks shouldn t require any condiments other than salt and pepper our overall dining experience was extremely disappointing we expect better everything especially when we paid 300 for a couple of steaks and an appetizer
  i have to give this a 4 star for the breakfast burrito i just had the amado breakfast burrito and it one of the best i ve had in az made with hash browns nice and soft to mold the bacon egg and cheese into a gushy goodness fast hot and great taste if breakfast burritos are your passion as they are mine dont miss this hot spot looking forward to a revisit
  yes i gave them a five star for strictly their duck foie gras amazing plus they were super cool and treated me well the chef knows his stuff i had the foie gras mousse as a desert yes dessert and it was amazing i wish the grilled foie gras on their poutine was served by itself sooooo good i had the stripped bass it was ok hate to say it cause such a good place but little more fishy then i was expecting the meatballs was great the octopus with mussels was decent i m from louisiana and these were the smallest i ve ever seen but they were decent flavor wise the ravioli was awesome seriously contemplating coming back a third time before i leave just like their pairings get the foie gras anything just saying
  i stopped in here for lunch midweek it s a large open space with a few tables and a bar area the ace o spades sandwich was humongous and full of meatballs sauce and cheese a really good sandwich and i took home half which was great warmed up the next day i d like to come back and try their pizza sometime
  horrible service subpar product terrible atmosphere probably the worse hookah place i ve ever been to no respect or care for customer or art of hookah embarrassment to the hookah community
  i am in love with this pizza i wish they had better hours though i look forward to this wednesday just so i can get another pizza if you aren t a fan of sweet sauce this is not the pizza for you i love the sweetness of this sauce definitely a must have in pittsburgh
  this has to have been the worst ding experience i ve ever had bordering on abusive service we ended up asking for the check before the mains arrived but more than an hour after being seated it was not busy
  i love d s every tuesday a group of us from pitt come for the large one topping 10 pizza night the waiters and waitresses are always so friendly i have never had a bad experience here the beer cave is a must they have such a variety of beers that there is something for everyone once you make your choice put it in one of their beer coolers to make it nice and cold you are crazy if you don t like d s
  nice 24 hr bun mi how can u go wrong
  when it comes to thai food i am very picky since i was raised on thai and lao food panna thai you were great the food was exceptional and authentic to me i always compare my thai food to my mothers home cooking and panna thai did a great job
  good priced but not the best if one is carb conscious
  very good sandwich shop small lil place but great sandwiches
  drove up and walked in to postino on friday afternoon i walked in and they were happy to show me around the place looks fantastic as a fan of the former katz deli i was happy to see they kept some of the original feel but clean modern and very hip what a great addition to the neighborhood when they finish adding a pizzeria market and bar in that little corner i will be stoked thanks for the recommendation on taco tote also tj
  i ve been in vegas for 5 years and i ve never found a mexican restaurant i ve loved until i came here this afternoon the strawberry margarita is amazing but the food takes the win chef paco has such amazing menu we ordered the fresh table side guacamole al pastor tacos carne asada platter and pineapple shrimp dessert is on its way i will definitely be back
  when i m in vegas and itching for kbbq or anything korean for that matter i come to this 24 hour restaurant everything you d expect to find is on the menu but i thought the squid dish was excellent as well at the kalbi it s close enough to the major casinos to be only about a 10 15 dollar taxi ride it might be a pain to get a cab at 3am on the way back home but there are plenty roaming around on spring mtn to not be stranded try mother s as well but both are pretty much the same to me
  i ve been living in the coronado neighborhood for about 6 months perc up was just getting started when i moved in i liked the place and the food was good but it lacked personality and sometimes took quite a while i went there often when i moved in but hadn t been in a few months so i was up early on my day off yesterday and felt like getting off to a good start with some coffee and breakfast i live right down the street so i thought of perc up the new owner jackie greeted me as i walked up to the restaurant and seeing my confusion at the dueling signage for perc up and wy knot right next to each other explained that perc up was no more but reassured me that i was still in the right place if i was looking for some good breakfast i believe she said she owns another restaurant in pennsylvania which gives me hope that this place will last unlike its predecessors rip drip toast and now perc up she s big on healthy fresh ingredients and doing things the right way which i love the coffee was great the southwest breakfast burrito with bacon was awesome and with her picture of her dog and warm personality made me smile this is just the type of place i love going to locally owned cozy and friendly i ll certainly be hitting it up several times a month
  great atmosphere for drinks with friends on the weekend the smokestack smoked wood chips flavor of your choice and whiskey is so unique and fun to watch being made if you aren t a bourbon fan they also have a wide selection of cocktails and almost 50 brews on draft had a great time there friday night and i will definitely go back
  went there for the sunday brunch with sarah a nice place she had the eggs benedict and i had the chicken piccata both dishes sported a bit of sweetness that was interesting the mimosa and bloody mary they served were on the weak side i would have given it five stars if the prices were a bit lower and the drinks normal strength i just read three reviews that gave trw e one star steve r glendale az 8 25 2013 jacque r peoria az 9 8 2013 jeff r peoria az 9 8 2013 i m not going to go so far as to drop my rating still four stars because the service was good and we left nicely fed actually sarah was full but she s a small lady but i can totally understand where they re coming from
  moving here from chicago i didn t have high hopes for pizza there were actually several strike outs before i stumbled upon this little gem the pizza is as close to chicago style as i have found thin crust or deep dish good toppings not those nasty turd ball sausage pieces the salads are amazing too i highly recommend this is my go to pizza place
  meh our waitress was nice but the food took a while to come out as it was pretty blah and i don t understand the change from new orleans to parisian theme it s not really french food and the decor isn t really french either i would be offended if i were a frenchmen sacre bleh
  some of the best clam chowder ever
  good breakfast but nothing spectacular the best item is their coffee and hot cakes veggie omelet was just ok breakfast potatoes are good and my english muffin came out a little hard and burnt if i lived right next door then maybe i would come here again but to be honest there are so many better breakfast spots in charlotte
  clean environment friendly atmosphere nice staff good food alcohol i mean does it get any better than that the ingredients are fresh there is a menu of pizzas and salads you can choose from or you can create your own happiness my personal fav is the tomato basil with garlic oil and marinara then some extra garlic mushrooms and spinach now that right there is some mighty fine eating the flavor is amazing and the wait is never long i don t see myself not going here anytime soon they are my new pizza addiction and i am not ashamed to admit it
  i had the green chili enchilada style with rice and beans oh my heck so delicious lots of great mexican food in arizona
  a great place to either grab a beer and or enjoy some comfort food the set up is a little awkward when you walk in the dining area and kids play area with video games is on the left and the bar and patio are to the right so choose accordingly it has a long bar with big tvs and all the standard beers the burgers are really good juicey lucy style with cheese on the inside of the burger and they serve tater tots as sides
  crazy good charlotte needed a good casual place like this food is very fresh and sooo good when i told the woman at the counter i had never been there before she made recommendations and helped me out unlike other places that roll their eyes or just look anoyed i took a menu back to work highly recommend to everyone
  i went here for a work christmas party i was in heaven the food was delicious as was the atmosphere basically we had the 4 course dinner special i was drinking chardonnay as i like the white wines it was cold and delicious it was a little different for us because i had the eggplant rollentin and caesar salad with real anchovies i like the salty fish blame it on genetics i appreciate that the fish wasn t just in the salad dressing next up was filet mignon i have never had better filet mignon it was tall as it was big around it was not small and oh so tender and juicy i finished up with new york cheesecake i am sure they had to roll me out the door i was so stuffed but every bite was orgasmic every time my glass came anywhere near empty it was refilled the staff was on target and kept us well fed and wined we finished the night with some tasty port wine dessert and then dessert fabulous
  went here w my fam bam 3am last friday and i agree w tracy the soup was very salty cold and was nothing special at all the tocino was hard and cold as well you would think that your food will be serve hot if you go to a restaurant but not here oh and btw we waited about 20 25 mins to get seated but when we got inside there were lots of vacant table i wonder if it was the owner s idea to have people wait in line to make it seem that the place is always busy absolutely not going back to this place
  gourmet no i had a reuben that was about as lackluster as they come thick soggy rye a scant amount of flavorless corned beef they forgot the cheese a small bit of sauerkraut and almost no dressing a flavorless mess that i tossed after a few bites cheese soup was ok but it also seriously lacked flavor and the bread bowl had the consistency of a hamburger bun greek salad wrap was ok but also mostly without flavor it is cheap and they give you large portions which is good if that s what you re looking for but i won t be back
  we ate here april 2013 so i am a little sketchy on exactly why i didn t like this place but i do remember i had the beef stroganoff and it was horrible i thought a russian restaurant should know how to make an excellent stroganoff but noodles soaked up all the sauce and little bits of beef were so tough service was good
  this is our first time visiting the restaurant and we absolutely love it we ordered the premium package and ordered an extra plate of beef tongue and pork belly to go with it the menu is easy to read and has pitcures for you to see what each item is good for first timers the food presentation was very nice and fresh the staff is very welcoming and polite they were prompt with getting our food out we loved that they didnt hover over us they gave us space and let us cook the meat at our own pace unlike other korean restaurants where they just dump all the meat on the grill and start cooking anything and everything for you whether you re ready for it or not the restaurant also has a nice and clean dining atmosphere we came here around 2pm on friday and not many people we eating here we will probably come here every time we visit vegas we are from tx we recommend anyone who loves korean bbq to come out and try this place when you re in las vegas you will not be disappointed
  awesome awesome awesome not only was the service spectacular but the food was even better it didn t cost an arm and a leg either great coffee and almost everything is made from scratch christina was our server and she was excellent definitely stop by here it s worth the 20 minute wait for breakfast or lunch
  the blue ox has been a favorite haunt of mine for 25 years awesome burgers and bar food a little smokey these days but the wait staff and bartenders are great awesome local dive
  finally henderson or the border with henderson has a good taqueria super b burrito brings the simple fresh and tasty flavors of a classic taqueria to the vegas suburb the guacamole fresh and oh so good the pinto beans fresh and tasty the salsa and hot sauce fresh and spicy super b burrito does the classics right a carne asada super burrito around 5 plus tax comes with rice and beans guacamole salsa cheese and sour cream and it s good real good even the tortilla is well textured and chewy i e not out of the freezer you may have noticed a repetition of the word fresh it s a simple but necessary concept for a great burrito super b burrito understands that and it s a solid taqueria because of it and in a valley that has suffered so long with the 1 2 day old tastes of roberto s it s revolutionary but don t think that super b burrito only offers the classics if you re a meat eater this is your place they prepare pork steak and chicken in a variety of manners i had the coca cola fried pork in my burrito and it was tender and sweet but not over the top sugary here s how good that pork is i always always order a carne asada burrito when first testing a taqueria but when we stepped into the place the guy behind the counter found out it was our first time there and started offering samples of the various meats the pork in green chile was spicy and delicious but there was no challenger to the coca cola fried pork it s what will keep me going back again and again unfortunately one of the folks that came with us ordered the vegetarian burrito and it was less than stellar super b burrito basically serves up the super burrito described above without the meat as a vegetarian option they do add in some lettuce but it needs a little more oomph either the typical fajita veggies or at least a couple different types of beans would help immensely without that you really notice the lack of the meat addition so four stars for the pork burrito two stars for the vegetarian how did we get back to four stars overall the customer service is exemplary friendly quick and willing to educate the customer on the taqueria s specialties the guy who helped us was so awesome that we were sold on supporting the business before tasting the burrito i will definitely be back as a repeat customer hopefully they ll improve their vegetarian burrito and we can bring the vegetarian back again for another try
  this location has the best service when they take your order they are always friendly and their delivery people are very friendly too i work near by so it s always nice to know that i can count on a good sandwich with awesome customer service i would recommend ordering from here
  i liked the restaurant although the fake painted poles supposed to look like palm trees are a little hokey the view of the city made up for that the food was delicious including the amazing crab cakes i d definitely dine here again
  terrible i stop by here expecting at a minimum some standard sports bar fare like burgers and fries i was disappointed to find that everything is pre made wrapped in plastic and very cold you re better off going to the food cart in the terminal
  so this is mine and my bfs go to bar for ufc fights and sporting events the service has always been decent if not great the amount of tvs and the set up gives this place the potential to be one of the top sports bar in the biltmore area if the food and beer selection kicked it up a few notches i was going to give this bar more than 3 stars but after reviewing why other yelpers gave half moon a low star rating it reminded me of my first here and why i was disappointed in this place i guess over time i have adjusted my view since it is the only bar i know of who shows the ufc fights in the area i can say over the past 3 years the food has improved some but the establishment could really beef up the number of beers they have on tap
  our family loved it we came here with a party of 23 this was a casual dinner for my cousin and her family from georgia the kids had a table for themselves and they were grubbin the waiters were very helpful with the menu our favorites are the salt and pepper shrimp salt and pepper pork chops and salt and pepper squid hmmm did we miss another salt pepper dish lol the best dish was the beef hot pot yummmmm even the most finicky of the family enjoyed it we were stuffed o
  my favorite place to go love beef shrimp chow fun spicy and cure for hangovers wonton soup with no pork bomb ass soup
  amazing as expected same great food with more room and outside dining boylan birch beer and cherry popper great combo daughter loved the chicks in broadway and she said the bathrooms were decorated nice ha she s only 3
  thomas our server was impeccable he is the reason i d return the food was really good i d say the sea bass was a little bland but the crabcake was one of the best ice ever had
  great bbq great value great atmosphere great music waiter was friendly and attentive
  from the parking lot this place didn t look like anything special but once you step in its interior is much different from its cover i started off with foie gras wasn t on the menu and must say it was different more on the sweet side but it was a pleasant surprise the tasso ham crawfish risotto was delicious the twice baked parmesan souffle was fluffy creamy and quite good as well for the main course the cashew crusted salmon with the creamed potatoes and some type of butter sauce was light and executed right i also tried the grilled pork chop it was nicely portioned and the reduction sauce went hand in hand with the chops creme brulee for dessert just plain perfect i would also like to mention that the presentation of all the dishes were beautiful most importantly the service let me tell you i have never been to a restaurant where each staff member i encountered were so eager to please and i ve been to a fair share of restaurants their hospitality here is second to none examples of outstanding service our glass of water never reached half full i had left my cocktail at the bar while waiting to be seated went out to the parking lot went back in the restaurant about 15 minutes later got seated and then the bartender approaches the table and brings me my drink we took a smoke break before dessert and when walking back into the restaurant there were both our napkins folded on our table and 2 servers both with our chairs pulled out waiting to slide it in as we sat everytime a plate was set on the table there were 2 servers 1 on each side placing down our plates in sync and briefly describing the dish i took a quick bathroom break came back to see my napkin neatly folded on the table we were brought bite sized appetizers a couple times during the meal compliments of the chef overall the food was excellent and the service was unreal
  if i could give them four and half stars i would my boyfriend and i went here friday night we really liked the concept pasta customization cool we ordered the asiago bleu mac and cheese for me crazy alfredo for him gnocci with pesto mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes and bread sticks to share i loved my mac and cheese the bleu wasn t too overwhelming but still had that bite you expect with bleu cheese the crazy alfredo had a lot in it chicken italian sausage steak and shrimp in a roasted pepper alfredo sauce i personally did not try it but my boyfriend said it was very good the only reason for the half star would be for the size of the shrimp and the beer selection the shrimp were pretty tiny the pasta only cost a little over 10 but he said that he would have been happier with three big ones versus a few little guys we were pretty happy to see that they serve beer and wine but the selection was minimal my boy is a beer guy so of course he wanted more overall we loved it we ll definitely be back and indulge in our carb intake here
  waited till my 5th visit to review don t get all bad reviews it s a fast food place as expected what impresses me is they are always busy and clean my kids love the orange chicken if course they are kids
  used yelp s 10 off very impressed by how good the food is here only downfall was the plastic utensils and uncomfortable plastic chairs atmosphere is like a loft and staff was friendly cant wait to come back and try breakfast
  i was pretty shocked to learn that mtl now had a legit korean bbq place so naturally my expectations were raised in comparison to korean you can get in toronto this place is generic the marinades on the meats leave much to be desired while the freshness is evident the korean flavor is diluted
  well i can t comment on the food as i only went for a late evening round of drinks which i think turned into 5 or 6 rounds the place is definitely cozy and welcoming and while i m not sure of the guestlist situation the fellow at the elevator just nodded at us as our group announced itself and ushered us right in as it was the middle of the week the place was pretty calm and not overrun by pretentious twits which was just perfect by us good drinks with an excellent selection and a bartender that also sold us cigarettes and cigars made it very difficult to want to leave from the buddha at the top of the elevator to the strip in all of its lurid glory the views here are worth the trip
  fun fast fabulous flavorful and first the best place for flavorful food fast service fabulous employees and fun atmosphere i would travel miles to eat here it s my first stop from the airport and i enjoy lunch and dinner on the same day
  we were served spoiled food the butter tasted pungent rancid so we told waitress she took it sway and said chef thinks all butter was left out overnight sooo you knew butter bad and served it anyways risking our health w spoiled food wow and no manager came out to apologize complained to corp but still no response we won t go back
  i absolutely loved this place walking in the dark and warm atmosphere captures you right away everyone greets you with a friendly face and a hello as you seat yourself our server mandy made us feel very welcome and was very prompt in every way i am also a huge fan of craft beers and she did a great job of recommending a few that i enjoyed i ordered the cajun chicken pasty and it was amazing great taste good portion and fair prices i will definitely be returning as i had a great experience
  been here plenty of times in the past few months have been very good went today and not only did they raise the prices but the food went down in quality what happened this was by far my favorite mexican place to go so i will give it a try again if the quality goes back up i will rewrite my review maybe i hit a off day but there was no where near as much meat and the taste of the food seemed like it was day old all the other times i ve been there that was the biggest thing is it all tasted fresh bring back the freshness quality and old prices
  i ve visited this location twice and both times it was the same good service fast service and service with a smile i m not huge on chipotle and i rarely eat there unless someone else is as in both of my cases it s chipotle and in saying that it s like saying it s mcdonald s which comes with a certain familiarity and consistency that you expect associated with the name that said it s decent quick and somewhat cheap i had the barbacoa tacos on one visit and also the new fritias sp soybean meat burrito i was not blown away by either but it was both palatable and is more than enough for one person
  i come here often because my bf likes to watch the wrestling events and i like to watch my dallas cowboy games the wrestling event would cost us around 40 bucks at home and that doesn t include food so our best option is going out to watch it the food is actually really good my issue is with the service i have had some good servers here but for the most part they pretty much suck maybe they are really busy but my guess is they don t care about pleasing us because they get to add 15 percent gratuity regardless of what we want they have no incentive to be good servers this is an issue and should be changed you don t get free refills on soda which is understandable but if you order a meal you should at least get one free refill it s a little ridiculous of you ask me i asked for a side of mayo and watched my burger get cold as i waited for 15 minutes to get it the crappy part is the fact that my server came to my table at least 2 times without it she had to have noticed that my burger was untouched and my bf s was gone that my friends is generally not giving a damn will i be back yes bc it s still cheaper then ordering at home they win i lose the end
  i d never thought i d find myself rating a wendy s but the employees here aren t your typical glazed over fast food workers they re friendly so much so that when i need my fast food fix in the area i will almost always choose this wendy s the recent changes to the menu are fine by me but the employees here make drive thru stops quick and painless what can i say this wendy s is a winner
  this was a really fun place and is a memorable experience for both food and ambiance the porch s ambiance is young and hip with tall ceilings garage door type walls that open up to let in some air and big visible pizza ovens sitting down you re definitely in the middle of it all but you also have some privacy the food was fun too the pizzas were creative but not zany the bianca for example had cheese figs and truffle oil a tasty combination that i haven t seen elsewhere but that immediately sounded delicious and so i ordered and loved it the pizzas are individual sized and are served on metal trays you get your pizza and then up to a trio of sides fresh parmesan super spicy red pepper flakes and some oregano i say up to because the kitchen only gives you the sides that would taste good on your pizza my bianca did not come with oregano for example the pizzas were all delicious i tried the margarita bianca and piggy the crust was some of the best crust i ve ever had soft and chewy and warm i also heard good things about the burger the drinks were also creative and tasty i had the pineapple sage margarita while it was a little sweet and this is coming from a dessert fanatic i still enjoyed it i also tasted the almost arnie and the porch pink lemonade and liked them both
  awesome food never fails at all just don t be in a hurry to be anywhere
  love the great dane celebrated many fun occasions there i m not a huge fan of the local brews they offer but the atmosphere and great food are so worth it a madison must
  today was my first visit to dukes the location isn t idle kind of off the beaten path but upside easy parking the atmosphere is great exactly what you want out of a sports bar lots of seating lots of tv s lots of pool tables easy to get a beer i would recommend it for anyone looking to watch a game or have a beer at a chill spot
  as has been said before this is a tiny place full of regular customers the portions are generous and the price certainly is right the waitress wouldn t stop asking my 2 year old what the easter bunny was bringing her it got kind of old especially since we don t worship bunnies at our house seating was tight and we got to sit next to a guy having breakfast with his girlfriend and happy to say that his wife was home sleeping i wouldn t say that that the clientele all lived in the trailer park but some do if we go again we ll try and get there early before the crowds the bacon was especially tasty
  eiffel tower is a delightful restaurant you arrive via elevator up through the eiffel tower structure in the middle of the paris casino complex the elevator opens directly into the kitchen pass which is a unique and rather cool touch i ve never seen before once you enter the dining room a dim room with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the strip you re greeted warmly this is one of the few high end restaurants i ve visited where even a family with a small baby admittedly a quiet well dressed baby was welcomed by the hostesses our family had made a reservation several months ago and had specifically asked for a table near the windows we were given a delightful 3 top with a perfect view of the bellagio fountains our service team was quiet and well trained although they did not quite meet the same level of service that one experiences at twist no holding of chairs for ladies etc my spouse suggested that i might be nit picking when i complained that they only utilized their crumb scrapers at the end of our meal rather than after each course the food itself was classical and elegant we started our meal with a cauliflower creme sent out by the chef as an amuse bouche rich roasty and delicious my son ordered the filet mignon which was perfectly prepared and delicious my entree was black cod served on a bed of cauliflower couscous the fish fell apart when i touched it with my fork it was tender moist and very well done easily the best non salmon fish entree i ve ever had my spouse ordered the wellington which he was not thrilled with it was prepared well and he had no specific critique it just didn t suit him for sides we shared the brown butter spaetzl and the green beans the former was delicious if a bit on the oily side while the latter were just green beans i d suggest you be more adventurous if you dine here for dessert we ordered chocolate cake and apple strudel my spouse loved the apple dish i found the chocolate cake to be too rich to finish which is saying something considering that i am a die hard chocoholic and the portion was small the management also sent over a lovely artists palate of assorted sorbet with a side of berries they explained that this was an apology for a drunken diner seated nearby that had to be asked to leave considering that we had not even noticed an incident occurring in this very quiet dining room i think this speaks volumes to the staffs discretion when handing front of the house issues honestly the sorbet raspberry mango green apple creme and chocolate were my favorite desserts i would order that again in a heartbeat in short paris is now my second favorite las vegas restaurant running behind twist and is recommended should you find yourself in that part of the country
  just had lunch at brio and it was a wonderful experience from the food to the service i went with a friend who had the steak salad and raved about it i being the vegetarian did not have a lot to choose from however was able to add asparagus and avocado to the chopped salad and loved it even better was our server ashley she made our lunch extra special she was friendly and knowledgable professional and attentive i would hire her in a heartbeat
  there is no shortage of mexican restaurants in vegas and each one boasts that they are the best el dorado cantina clearly stands head and shoulders above the rest why well for starters everything on the menu is organic and made with no gmo s best table side guacamole hands down don t let the fact that it s connected to a strip club dissuade you from coming here try the jalapeno margarita there s a little kick to it but not too spicy at all i don t normally like jalapenos but somehow when tequila is added i m all about it lol el dorado cantina is located next to the sapphire there is clearly a separate entrance into the restaurant el dorado is open 24 hours and has a full menu day or night locals get 25 off the entire bill on monday s too
  2 5 for the experience 5 for the free wi fi the owners of ernie s in scottsdale have opened up a second location i went online to check out the reviews for the other place and strangely there were none we were here on a saturday afternoon the place was pretty slow maybe only one or two other tables the service was there but nothing great happy hour on a saturday afternoon is usually a good thing but i wasn t really impressed by this one 1 off everything except wine and a few appetizers at a special price five ish beers on tap as for the food the maryland style wings were good maryland style wings with old bay seasoning we also ordered the crab cake sampler but i m not sure where the sampler part came in there were three golf ball size crab cakes and it came with cocktail and tartar sauce the crab cakes were great pretty much all crab meat no filler however for 13 95 they better be the other fried appetizers looked good the chicken sandwich and fries didn t look exciting let s just say i m not in a huge hurry to get back to ernie s then again i don t think this location has been open very long maybe i ll give them some time to settle in and then try again
  we have eaten at sylvia s many times over the past few years and there are always two constants the food is decent and the restaurant is hot as hell breakfast lunch or dinner you will usually get a good meal for a good price all restaurants do have their off days and sylvia s is no exception but we have been pleased more often than not the things that really irk me about the place is the fact that they charge an additional 75 cents if you want a to go cup i understand that everything costs money but 75 cents is a little steep also the place is really hot everytime we eat there in fact that is one of the biggest reasons we avoid the place i don t know if their air conditioner has been broken for four years or if the management is just too dang cheap to keep their customers comfortable
  best place in north phoenix for a few beers watch a game and eat fabulous food go to big guys you l love it
  great sushi service is good every time we go thanks to tomo s great quality food and cool atmosphere even my teenage kids love to eat sushi now we have eaten at at least 6 or 7 different places for sushi and this is easily one of the most consistently delicious
  to sum things up service was poor and disappointing by the time we had food served it was over 2 in a half hours later this place does not have a reputation of a pizzeria bianco problem 1 we waited over an hour to get seated for a large party once everyone got here which we were ok with that s why we stuck around then when they actually seated us our parties didn t even get to sit together problem 2 not everyone fit in the booth after waiting for so long problem 3 we waited to get the food over an hour no one came to apologize or tell us why it was taking so long until we requested a manager we sat down at 805 ordered by 815 food came out at 930 wings pasta sandwiches and thin crust pizza shouldn t take over an hour they told us the deep dish took 30 40min problem 4 we asked to speak to a manager all she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything she told me food here takes an hour especially deep dish its written in the menu as a story who the hell reads that shit that s a lie if the order went in at 850 like she said how did we get our food earlier at 930 we should have gotten it at 950 and our order should have went in at 815 other parties that sat 30 min later got their pastas and salads well before us i didn t think an appetizer would take that long she explained that they cook the pizza first then make wings sandwiches so they are ready the same time when i had gotten my wings they were cold dried and overcook the manager shouldn t even be running the place if she can t even service the people they asked if we want new wings we don t want to wait another hour for that problem 5 manager said she would comp the pizza cookies we got charged for all that and had to complain again about the wings the manager had to come back and talk to us again and she finally apologized which should have been done i don t complain unless it s reasonable enough to complain she just didn t handle it properly the first time around no one really ate their food i m sure it would have been good if food was hot and ready to eat instead of cold after waiting over an hour then being lied to a week later we took our birthday friend to the parlor to make up for the poor oregano s experience and it was 10x better
  it was ok ok food ok service no plans to go back
  incredibly overhyped came in for a drink and a bite on a saturday evening early the bar was utterly packed with people all sort of gaping at me as i tried to talk to the waiter host about eating he sort of stared at me like i was speaking german there seem to only be tables for a max of 16 18 people and like many leith establishments solo parties don t get tables one man offered me his seat at the bar as he would be leaving shortly but i apparently didn t thank him fast enough got a bit of the gas face from him and the host host insisted no tables and as i had simply specified i d ve liked to eat anywhere i had to ask about the bar he said sure if you want i m not terribly sensitive but i got a definite fuck off vibe from the guy and walked but guess what i m still reviewing the place based solely on atmosphere and service this place blows for what it s worth i live in brooklyn and came by on claims this place had buzz was unimpressed even before interacting with anyone
  fresh and hot food honey chicken and shrimp tasted very good and orange chicken as well would definitely recommend it
  you would think that by the name of this restaurant that it would be near water well it s not but the decor on the inside tries to emulate a fun beachy sort of atmosphere i m guessing the relative closeness of lake pleasant inspired the theme of this restaurant the food is similar to what you would expect at a typical sports bar nothing much really to say but lots of fried items the prices really don t match the quality of food you get here don t come here looking for a great meal maybe something to fill your stomach while watching a sports game for the area this is a decent place to go watch your favorite sports team as they have many up to date tv s with a wide variety of channels to choose from
  this has to be the best place for pizza great service friendly people and an awesome atmosphere simply the best i ve been coming to nello s for over 30 years and nothing has changed but the location the quality of the food and the service is simply superb everyone should come and try the food here you won t be disappointed they can accommodate for big parties and the service never changes thank you nello s
  food poisoning enough said had to leave our show o early because of this food poisoning the maitre de was rude cold and snobbish not even bothering to take our names when we arrived service was wonderful as well as the chocolate souffle but neither make up for being sick for the next 24 hours
  i m not sure how it s even possible that i haven t reviewed broadway pizza before now because it is one of my regular haunts i was even more shocked that i only have 2 yelp check ins at anthony mario s place because i ve been there at least 3 time this month alone and i m sure at least 150 times in my life with all of that said let s get to the pizza broadway pizza is exactly the same delicious pie that you will find at the local pizza joints when perusing the streets of new york city the crust is always the perfect thickness and texture with a great crispiness that only comes from using the best ingredients the sauce is sweet and well seasoned the cheese is plentiful and simply delicious my wife and i are into the cheese pizza thing lately because the flavor of the pie can t be masked by the overwhelming taste of sausage onions or peppers and broadway doesn t disappoint we have had occasion to order a more loaded pie when our kids are with us and i can say those pizzas have been delicious as well the other staple of our trips to broadway are the garlic knots for any of you that haven t experienced broadway pizza s garlic knots my best description would be buttery garlicy mounds of love the knots are made from pizza dough which is rolled out and twisted into what else knots and then baked they are slathered with butter garlic and served hot they are a treat broadway had 2 locations rancho at charleston and west sahara near cimarron funny thing is the sahara location seems to do their crust a little differently the crust at sahara seems to be a little thicker than at rancho it still tastes great but tends to not be as crisp as the rancho location either way broadway pizza is a winner if you re looking for a great ny style pie
  not kid friendly staff unpleasantly unfriendly will give it another shot one day but for now 1 star
  first of all it s obvious that these 2 reviews are either 1 written by the owners or 2 written by the owners the reviews are written on the same day and both reviews praised the exact same dishes with the same broken english not only this but each user has only 1 review i m a frequent yelp user but did not have an account but when i saw these false reviews i had to make an account just to state the truth about this dive i ve been to this restaurant 3 times giving it the benefit of the doubt and every time they failed miserably if it s not the inconsistency of menu prices than it s the inconsistency of food which makes it a no go each time i had invited a friend and they also were disappointed the food would be mediocre to say the best and the food was overpriced i ve ordered the bo luc lac shaken beef 13 and it s obvious that the beef was of low quality when you can get good top quality beef at kim long down the street for cheaper 10 the famous garlic rice is nothing to rave about it just tastes like salted rice soaked in butter and garlic the ambiance is reminiscent of a flea market food court with its cheesy decor it s quite depressing when you re the only table there while the chef keeps popping in and out from the kitchen it seems like a mom pop ran operation and maybe this is why they just don t get it the service was nice but other than that everything else was sub par that s why when i saw these reviews it made me so upset because they were false and obviously were written by the restaurant if i could give 0 stars i would but i ll give 1 because of the nice waitress
  love stopping here for a quick drink and tasty appetizer the gnocchi is consistently spot on delicious friendly prompt service and outdoor patio seating just hold on to your hats on windy days overall i always look forward to winding down here
  i had my daughters graduation party on the patio at rudy s huge props to mitch and crew the night was wonderful the food was amazing everyone was raving about it the cream corn and brisket is a must pulled pork is amazing you really can t go wrong with anything btw mariana was not grumpy
  can you say fresh this place rules me being a pizza freak and all i have to say hands down one of the best pizza i have ever had love the way how the wood burning oven brick cooks the pizza the taste and the color it gets is just the way i like it i m very critical about the pizza dough don t like thin crust nor pan style or chewy tough i m somewhere in the middle and this place fits what i look for in a pizza plus all the pizza is custom built hence custom built pizza the pistachio pesto is a must try i can t wait to go back
  an excellent place for lunch the food is solid and the prices are very reasonable i had the lunch buffet which consisted of a small but quaint selection two soups five sides a couple of salads two meats and a fish oh and a couple of desserts which i forgot to try service is very friendly though the in training server to customer ratio is a bit high would love to try more often except it s too far from my part of town
  good cheesesteak good value for your money fries are huge and very good if this is what you are in the mood for you can t go wrong
  we heard good things about this place so we decided to try it nice atmosphere inside and the wait staff very courtious we had the ribeye and chicken parmesan the ribeye was very disappointing it was just ok no seasonings or flavor just plain chicken parmesan was ok we paid alot of money for an average meal don t mind paying for a good steak this place didn t fit the bill
  came here for dinner three nights in a row and enjoyed each night i came but if i went another night i don t think i would ve enjoyed it as much because their menu is limited the first night i came to biscayne i ordered the started seared scallops with asparagus the scallops were beautifully cooked and the sauce along side was a delicious combination i also shared the caesar salad with a friend i saw on yelp they give whole leaves of lettuce so i had them chop up the leaves the salad was a little too overdressed for me but it was still good for my entree i ordered the smaller filet mignon it came with brussel sprouts which were delicious as for my steak though i asked for medium rare the outside looked dry and kind of unappetizing for dessert i got the key lime tart the plate presentation wasn t very elegant but after eating such a heavy meal it was nice that the tart was light and fairly cleansing the second night for dinner my grandparents ordered the seasonal oysters they were so good not slimy or gritty at all some were a little small but others were fairly well in size for my starter my grandmother told me to try the eggplant lamb tacos the salsa that came with the tacos was delicious but sadly the tacos themselves were too oily for my liking i also ordered the french onion soup it wasn t too salty like many can be i ordered the crab legs for dinner and they were pretty good nothing super special but what i like most is the fact that they cut them open for you no need to get your hands dirty from peeling out the meat yourself and for dessert i ordered the apple tart thing it s like baked apples over a phyllo dough chip served along side caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream the caramel sauce with the ice cream was great but the apple tart itself wasn t super good i rather have an apple crisp like dessert instead finally on my last night here i started with the lobster bisque usually i like my bisques but because this was a lobster bisque it was really rich and salty if you like rich foods i suggest getting this i then got the shrimp scampi starter i didn t realize it came with a lobster sauce so great more rich food i hope you hear my sarcasm my aunty ordered the shrimp scampi the day before with a lemon butter sauce which is what i should ve asked for but forgot her s looked delicious so by the time my entree came i was already filled with soo much rich and heavy foods i ordered the seared scallops for dinner that s six fat scallops cooked to perfection i sadly could only eat 2 5 of them i felt terrible for wasting them but i just couldn t fit anything else in my stomach if you come to biscayne definitely try their scallops and oysters if you have the option
  kickback is a really fun place definitely entertaining for a couple of hours the decor is fun and bright and really gets you in the mood for some pinball the machines are for the most part in great shape there s usually only 2 or 3 down every time we visit their food is pretty great considering it s all done on small machines right behind the counter i m an especially big fan of their diy salad combinations since you can get all kinds of exciting things atop your greens don t expect to eat anything heavy though their paninis are good also of note they re byob and if you ask ahead you can hold a party there we invited some friends brought a cake and some beer and got a handful of tokens for everybody it was tons of fun
  no sense of urgency the staff will leave you standing at the door waiting to be seated with with half the restaurant empty smh food is good but service lacks kinda disappointing especially with a restaurant sporting so many awards
  i have long wanted to eat teppanyaki style food and been thinking of going to benihana for a longest time but after reading reviews on yelp for the one in sunnyvale ca i was quite apprehensive i had also heard good things about benihana in pittsburgh from my brother in law and so decided to go there whenever i goto pittsburgh so finally we went there after new years and had a blast we had to wait at the bar even after making reservation but thats ok at the table we were not rushed at all the food was tasty and the chef was funny and interesting not to mention very entertaining and friendly bartender marty overall it was one of the best restaurant experiences we ever had
  we loved it my husband and i came here with my parents and we all enjoyed our meals the biscuits are so yummy this is my new favorite breakfast place
  great food and service the tuna steak is great love the steak bento as well great price for a good meal
  in grade school one of my best friends pranav had me over his house a couple of times for dinner his mom cooked the most bizarre yet flavourful food my near virginal midwestern tastebuds had ever yet encountered at the time i remember not really being sure i liked it and at the same time craving to go back and have some more when i recently began to work nearby to india palace and saw their sign for the lunch boofay i thought back to those days in pranav s stinky house and marched right inside with my 9 bucks in hand they are a little more classy than the pay first boofays as you are seated and served drinks by waiters and will get your bill later at first glance the bufett table seemed smallish to me but once i started scooping out the various gloops onto my pile of rice veggies it really added up fast there were plenty of choices labeled as meat no meat and with the dishes names although i still had to consult the menu to decipher what gloop i was scooping for the non adventurous in your family or group there is some nice almost plain jasmine rice and tandoori chicken simple skinless barbecued chicken pieces that taste like the best picnic cooked over a charcoal grill chicken you can remember for those a little more adventurous just try it all they do not stock the exact same items each day so it is a must to go on different days to sample all you can you can round out your meal with some fresh veggies although not really a full fledged salad bar not like the veg heads don t have plenty to choose from here and i loooooove the mango chutney mint cilantro whatever sauce and tamarind sauce i get a big bowl of each and use it all up no waste goes great with the freshly made naan bread that you get with your meal my grade school friend pranav is a big shot doctor now in boston but i d love to have that chance to take him here and find out if it s as authentic as it seems to be judging by the large volume of indian clientelle that i always see here it probably is i always find that to be a great way to judge any ethnic eatery or grocery store watch out for the anise near the register it s not as close to an after dinner mint as i was led to believe ps not sure if others would have the same experience but my 12 y o did not like this place at all and since they stop the kid s price quite young at like 9 or so here i learned to save my cash and not bring her
  whenever i visit waterloo i get their green curry rice dish with a coconut shrimp appetizer omgggg their coconut shrimps are soooooooooo to die for service has never been disappointing it s clean the decor is thai themed i ve been here 10 times price is reasonable too you could have lunch for under 12
  i thought about sending a thank you card but then i thought hey a yelp review would be better hopefully getting them more business we were staying at the holiday inn for a wedding with family and they had happened to be catering a rotary dinner that evening we started chatting with the chef he asked why we were in town and told him so he said let me cook for you best decision ever they totally set us up on the back patio with tablecloths and everything oh my heck the food so delicious and beautifully plated we weren t in florence az anymore friends i hope they know how special they made us feel thank you thank you you were the icing on the cake of our wonderful weekend i wish i knew how to share our facebook pictures of the beautiful food or convey how wonderful this was if you ever go to florence and love greek you will love we did not go to the restaurant but were blessed by having them cook for us at the hotel you will not be disappointed by the hospitality or the food enjoy
  my boyfriend and i came here just the other day it was great we had some steamed coffee the kind with a timer and crepe s was a fun place and not too expensive either will definitely return in time
  each time i ve been here i went to play bingo the bingo is amazing they have cool themes drink specials and random prizes when you win each win requires you to answer trivia questions correctly in order to receive a prize prizes include gift certificates for your next visit or other valuable prizes like dollar store chip clips the guy who runs bingo is entertaining and really likable unless you get offended easily or act like a jerk don t use your phone during bingo unless you want it taken away i ve had the mac and cheese and cornbread and both were really really good like ridiculously good mac and cheese mac and cheese that tastes like magic was sprinkled in if you like bar trivia combined with bingo combined with good food combined with an entertaining and charming host head to bingo nights at union pig and chicken
  golly don t even want to give them a star stay away far away went there for our anniversary terrible service food cold as ice then they reheated it till it was well done i left eating nothing i felt like we were being punked manager could careless and waiter said i hope it s nothing i did i said sure it is you let our food sit on the line till it was freezing cold
  real talk i have only experienced hakataya through their delivery option so take that into account with this review it s sunday and has with most sundays i m pretty darn lazy i fall into the trap of using said lazy days as an excuse to cram fried takeaway down my gullet but on this particular sunday i knew i had a busy few hours ahead and needed something somewhat healthy if i was going to make it to midnight so i took advantage of the fact that hakataya is now on deliveroo and you can order sushi from home in 40 minutes i had gyoza agadashi tofu chopped scallop maki unagi nigiri eel and seaweed salad at my disposal yes i have a hollow leg and a ridiculous appetite more real talk i m a sushi snob i m from vancouver canada one of the best sushi cities in the world and i m particular as heck i don t mind if you roll your eyes at that it s an eye rollable statement but it s also true so there were a few stand outs in my meal but not enough that i d rush to order from these folks again i definitely recommend the seaweed salad and the chopped scallop tobiko maki the gyoza were just ok and i d all out pass on the agadashi tofu unagi the next time around what leaves me really hopefully with these folks is the excellent reviews so far on their ramen i ve been desperately looking for a great ramen place so i ll definitely be in to give it a go plus their rainbow roll looks tempting enough but for the time being these folks stay in the middle ground for me not great not bad a ok
  ordered a take out dinner picked it up 20 minutes before they closed half the ingredients were missing from the main dish and the egg rolls they promised were not there go back the next day to correct this they argued with me and kept me waiting for 20 minutes the manager said fine i will get you four egg rolls and then walked away 5 minutes later she gave me a bag and said heres your meal again still no egg rolls instead of arguing more i just left too much competition to deal with their poor customer service
  stax has an awesome concept but its execution leaves much to be desired the idea behind this trendy little slider bar is brilliant tasty little burgers and beer in a modern setting what isn t there to like for starters the ridiculous price for those burgers the quality of the patty bun and creative combination of toppings is good but not fully satisfying but what really gets me is the price 5 as the starting point for something that s roughly the size of my fist is insane the value doesn t get that much better if you order the bigger burger sizes once i consume the two or three i need to get a decent meal plus the al la carte sides i could have dined at many other trendy burger bars in the immediate area for a lower price the other thing that really sucks the parking situation stax is in a tiny old town scottsdale strip mall with a very limited amount of spaces it also has a two hour limit i don t know if it s strictly enforced but if it is and you re planning to go to a bar or club after that means you re better off battling the crowd to find parking around old town so you don t have to move your car when it really gets busy stax does have a decent little beer and specialty drink selection the dipping sauces for the tots are delicious it s also terrific if you re really into portion control i do love that they have an exotic meat depending on what s in season i once tried a rabbit burger on a whim and don t recommend it the server we had was also excellent he had a fun personality and was very attentive to our group of 10 stax is the kind of place i go to when others suggest it if you plan to hit up old town it could be a worthwhile starting point but if i want a gourmet burger i d rather go somewhere that gives me more bang for my buck
  been there twice awesome experience both times the food is amazing large portions excellent recipe the ribs are to die for they fall off the bone if it wasn t for the groupon i would of never known this place was only 4 minutes from our house we will definitely be back
  last night was family date night so we tried pot liquor for the first time our server was megan and she was so friendly and sweet my 2 yr old son had the kids mac cheese with fresh green apples and loved it my 5 yr old son had the kids chicken fingers with green apples and loved them my husband had the platter that came with brisket pulled pork and chicken for sides he did corn bread and mac cheese we were leary about the brisket because of some reviews i saw but it was very delicious even my 5 yr old that isn t a big beef eater loved it good flavor and very moist all in all it was a home run for the hubby i had the platter with half dry ribs and half mopped ribs with green beans and mac cheese i m usually not a big dry rub rib fan but let me tell you my mind was flipped at first bite they were absolutely delicious the mopped ribs were good too but from now on when we eat here i will be getting the dry rub ribs the green beans are fresh no cans here and they were yummy the mac cheese was creamy and yummy all in all a great meal and nice ambiance this family will definitely be back
  we cannot say enough great things about gerry and his amazing staff at eastside pizza we used them to cater our wedding party and everything was perfect gerry went out of his way to make sure every detail was taken care of including taking the time to re set the room when it was done incorrectly by the staff of the facility our guests loved the food and everyone had a great time we had the prime rib eggplant rollatini and chicken picatta and it was all delicious while deciding what to order we visited the restaurant and everything we tasted was so good it was tough to decide on just three entrees for the party in addition to having delicious food and an amazing staff gerry himself is an incredible person he is very involved in helping the community and goes out of his way to help the veterans and people in need in the vegas area he is honestly just the sweetest man and we are grateful we know him we do not live in vegas but look forward to our next visit so we can eat again at eastside pizza please go visit and try the food for yourself you will not be disappointed in fact you will easily be incredibly happy and full
  great chicken and sides the greens are a little too spicy for my taste i get the yams and apples friendly service wish they had more drinks in stock but i love me some quick it chicken
  something about neds is just better than any other sub place the bread the meats and cheeses the mayo oh man i can t get enough of neds recently catered a party with them and unknown to me they d accidentally shorted the meat on the platter we still had leftovers and they called out of the blue 2 days later telling me they had messed up and asking me if they could give me a gift card to make up for it who does that amazing
  the food is great i order all the time i gave them 3 stars because when i get my food delivered it take an hour plus to get my food and i live technically down the street other than time management the food is good i always get my food delivered so next time i m going to go to the establishment myself and give another viewing
  came here with a coupon so am factoring that in a bit my companion and i both ordered the big boss burger with some modifications the burger itself was very good although very saucy the fries were tasty when we were ordering they seemed to be out of quite a few things one of their drinks no special milkshake yam fries there was however one major problem we ordered a poutine as one of our sides and it came with some kind of shredded orangish cheese that may have been a cheddar in any case the combination with the gravy that was on the fries was completely unappetizing now if we were in bc or alberta this might be somewhat understandable but this is montreal it was delivered with no explanation and as we paid our bill we enquired about this choice and we were informed that they were also out of cheese curds and had chosen to make this substitution rather than let us know i get that it s february and restaurant business is slow at this time of year but this is a restaurant that specializes in burgers and their accompaniments i m shocked that they could run out of cheese curds combined with the other things that they were out of i worry that they would make the same choice to replace their signature hormone free antibiotic free free range meat with whatever they could get if they happened to run out
  really really love this place i m busy and don t have a lot of time to cook but like to eat healthy this place is not only healthy it s delicious i eat here a few times a week and i alway get the best service and a great meal quickly can t wait until they open more locations like right by my office
  best breakfast at sky harbor quick with four registers open the commuter sandwich is outstanding
  ok so it s no secret i m not a big fan of the native foods that i ve tried since coming to the phoenix area it s either too bland or too spicy or too greasy or sigh anyway i keep trying different places and this time i found something that i d consider reordering the spicy red chili stew it was simple but good i might come back if i had a friend in town who wanted to try native american food that s more than i can say for the other 2 native locations i ve tried the service here was also friendlier than the other places not friendly just friendlier haha might see ya there
  i just can t about a year ago i swore off five guys they had appeared on the vegas scene in all their glory and they have since multiplied i visited 5 guys in henderson and 5 guys in north vegas each time i just was not completely impressed the burger to me was too loaded with stuff it was too compacted in the foil the mustard and ketchup and mayo was all over the place the fries although good were too many too much ridiculous i don t want a bag of fries i wanted a little cup of fries why is that so hard to do 5 guys i get it it s their thing but i guess i just don t like it compare this with inn n out clean fresh nicely wrapped burgers crispy lettuce not too many condiments french fries perfect crispy lightly salted and served in a nice clean looking white tray the fries are not spilling all over your burger in the bag no they are just as they should be contained i tried 5 guys again i happened to be shopping at target i happened to be hungry it had been awhile so i thought maybe just maybe i would give 5 guys another shot and it all came back to me it s just not my cup of tea only cool thing new age coke machines but firehouse subs have these popular machines as well i will go to firehouse subs next time or inn n out anywhere but 5 guys
  so yummy healthier than most fast foods they are also much cleaner i enjoy using their chik fil a sauce make sure to try it they are super fast and very friendly
  wow this place went downhill quick i was there today and the food was disgusting i can t believe this was the same place that i use to love my friend had the turkey sausage patties they were the two smallest patties i ve ever seen i thought it was a joke also he got 3 1 2 slices of bread as his toast not even two pieces of bread i had steak and eggs the steak was like a leather and a side of fruit salad which they had sliced oranges in with the peal on with strawberries and bananas my scrambled eggs tasted like they sat under a heat lamp for 10 minutes for 35 for breakfast for two and we both left hungry it s not good the place was pretty busy which is good for them because i won t be back
  the best indian food in las vegas great place to both have a casual but memorable lunch or go all out for dinner i have a lot of favorites here everything is so good but i will try to mention just a few as appetizers you have to try the samosa chat curry leaf shrimp chicken tikka and chili basil chicken the fun part about the menu is you can do a tapas style dinner lunch with a few bites and maybe some hakka noodles wich by the way are very popular in bombay where this restaurant and head chef vijay originates for main course try chicken tikka masala lamb salli boti and i have to mention as well the bottomless curries served with a side of both basmati rice and the oh so yummy naan for dessert can t go wrong with the chocolate samosa or the in house made ice cream mango betel nut or rose or all three lol i also have to mention the restaurant has a dinning area and a separate bar area with flat screen tvs and the cocktails are just a must one of my favorites is the burban turban or the noble experiment sorry i couldn t just mention one so all in all this new gem is a must try i highly recommend you check it out
  tostadas de ceviche where delicious but a little high priced 7 my boyfriend got a tostada of aguachile and for 9 it wasn t spicy at all he even had to add hot sauce i would recommend the ceviche but not aguachile i would also recommend going midday since other reviews complain about loud music and i went around 2 00p m and the music was fine it was actually pretty empty so service was good not sure if i will be returning to try their shrimp cocktail or just wait to go to ca
  location plateau ish area near laurier metro street parking available but pay attention to the signs the place it s small decor is minimal and there s a pool table that in t very strategically positioned in the middle of the place i m still trying to figure that one out since if you happen to be sat right behind said pool table you risk having your back or arse poked with a stick anyway the theme here is 80s 90s which i can tolerate in small doses but not so much for an entire evening the wait staff at least the gals are outfitted in retro 80s gear and the music being played is genre londonbeat madonna micheal jackson etc the food i went for burger week will i go back nope i orderd the veggie burger also known as the humus burger while the bun itself was actually quite good the patty was just this brown lump that at first glance didn t look very appetizing was it good it was ok but i ve had better falafel style patties elsewhere half my burger was missing the bottom so i basically ate that half with a knife and fork while i ate the other as a burger should be eaten with my bare hands the burger was topped with lettuce tomato exactly two sweet potato chips and was accompanied by coleslaw no fries included as far as burgers go it was dull the coleslaw was spicy and just not good spicy coleslaw just doesn t work for me my date ordered a meat burger that she said was burnt and the accompanying fries were cold service the service was fine but the waitress didn t explain the two different burgers that were on offer for burger week we told her that s why we were there it was also incredibly slow to actually get our food maybe that s why the fries were cold on the up side we weren t pressed to leave when were done price point 11 for the veggie burger personally if you re going to give me a mediocre burger and not include fries 11 is overpriced
  simply amazing food the little breads were good be careful when getting sparkling water 16 bucks a bottle not worth it the food was perfect cooked well cameras all over th joint with waiters running all over the place like they going get fired for walking loud busy and delicious if you looking for quiet and intimite this is not the place did i say the food was good they fold your napkins when you go to bathroom and water serve does not miss a cup
  i have mix feelings about this place three of us had lunch there between the three of us half of the food we order was not good and the other half was fair good i would think if your in such a great location in the downtown summerlin mall everything coming out of the kitchen should be excellent the staff was friendly and the service was fast but the they could learn some tips from spring mountain road restaurants i think there is potential for improvement
  i love this restaurant it s very small and cozy but not at all overcrowded the lighting is low and the atmosphere is laid back so it s a great place to go with a group of friends or on a date the food is delicious i love the unique foods they use to fill the dinner crepes i tend to order the turkey apple and brie which never disappoints the dessert crepes are also fantastic sweet and tummy but not so rich that you re left with a toothache after the service is always friendly and the food gets out to you rather quickly i ve only gone right after work around 5 30pm so i usually beat the real dinner rush around 6 30 7 00
  i am so upset with myself for forgetting about this place for so long tonight i rediscoved the wonderful flavors of great delivery food the staff is always friendly and accomodating to my picky needs without compliant or frustration and i appreciate that my mouth watered from the flavorful chowmain and the crispy fried shrimp i ordered tonight i was very happy with the food and service as always i absolutely love love love this place
  amazing food great service and wine specials that are priced so well you will buy the bottle
  great friendly service at the bar the place has been totally redecorated no football helmets any more food was top notch and fresh good spot give another try
  meet some friends there for an australian reunion a few weeks ago the food was good and the service decent good atmosphere but not very authentic
  i have just had the great pleasure of using a thyme for all seasons for our company holiday luncheon last week and oh my goodness they surpassed all of my picky expectations i always want everything perfect and they did that and then some first of all their food was beyond amazing we wanted a holiday lunch that was outside the box per say something that was still holiday like but not the standard turkey and ham we were served the most delicious pork tenderloin with an out of this world merlot sauce as well as an apple walnut chicken that was so tender juicy and delicious other items included a delicious sweet potato roasted hash the best green beans almondine i have ever had it went beyond the normal green beans and slivered almonds it was fresh green beans cooked seasoned perfectly and they included roasted carmelized onions garlic mmmmmm we also had delicious shrimp crab cakes with a garlic aioli sauce a fresh holiday salad and an orzo salad with cranberries and walnuts at each table they placed a delicious appetizer tray with cheese crackers antipasti and homemade chips and salsa a very nice touch i could go on all day about the desserts we had mini cake pops that were almost too pretty to eat key word is almost mini pumpkin pies peppermint bark and coconut macaroons these were all homemade and super delicious they decorated the room beautifully and to have real plates napkins silverware was a very nice touch what i appreciated the most was the service speaking with the chef on site personally the day of the event and at the interview shows how much he cares about his clients and his food he was extremely friendly and professional and his entire staff was exactly the same way friendly perfection from my first initial phone call to the cleanup afterward i couldn t have asked for a better experience if you want a catering company that serves excellent food provides topnotch service and doesn t take you to the cleaners please trust me and just call a thyme for all seasons and don t go through calling and researching eight different companies first like i did you will not be disappointed i am looking forward to trying their restaurant in the near future to try their other delicious creations
  pricey chinese but so worth it
  over priced for just okay mexican food i would compare my 9 bean and cheese burrito to one at filliberto s i was also very upset that i paid 2 50 for a side of guacamole it was only 2 onces not worth the visit
  we have ordered delivery from this restaurant many times and it has always been delicious the lemon chicken and lemon shrimp are so good the portions are large and the food is always hot when it gets here however the food we got today was not up to the usual quality we have come to expect the fried rice was not fried rice at all but steamed rice mixed with soy sauce what s up with that also there were very few noodles in the pork lo mein there was one piece of broccoli in the lemon shrimp none in the lemon chicken it was still good but not nearly as good as it was in the past the crab puffs however were delicious and the spring rolls were really good i m thinking they are cutting corners to save money that s a shame raise the price a bit and keep the quality
  had a fabulous girls dinner here i d never been but one of the girls suggested it at first i was little leery i haven t really had my best meals in hotel restaurants i was pleasantly surprised the place is really pretty polished but unpretentious and comfortable with large tables and booths the kind of place you can meet with a big group of friends and they aren t put off and the bar area was hoppin the service was very good our waiter made great suggestions based on what we d like and was very attentive best of all was the food i had the caesar salad which was decent but the baked tomato soup was realllllllyyy good the flavors were delicious sometimes tomato soup can be really acidic but my guess is that they even it out with a creamy base maybe and the potato souffle sort of a whipped twice baked potato side which was also really nice i will definitely be back and i recommend it
  have been searching for great soups like this for 15 years only to find it in laval the thai spicy soups are so flavorful just the best since i live in laval this is a great option where we don t have to drive into the city for good pho
  the food here is pretty good we are here every week it has become a sort of ritual for us and we have never been disappointed well with the food anyway we are aware of the game they play when ordering in the drive through but it has gotten so much worse recently each item of your order is repeated back to you as you order with many pauses in between as well as repeated in its entirety again at the end it is so slow that they actually sound rather incompetent so much time is wasted placing your order that when you drive around to the pick up window they immediatley hand you the order and ask for payment this sounds great but they don t even give you a chance to put your car in park or gather your money in order to pay at first we were pleased with how quickly the order is ready yet now it has become rather annoying just know that if you see a long like at the drive thru do not worry once you get to the pick up window everything is ready
  time at the location 1 pm oct 3 2009 all just wanted to add a few comments about a this restaurant that i stop to eat its steeler bar which is not problem i am eagles fan and there a few tv s around the food was not that good i had the roast beef with lousy gravey more like a paste my wife had the chicken sandwich which according to her was fair the service is the worst i ve have ever experienced i would not recommend this place for anyone who like spend their hard earn money and not get good food adn service in return the hostess need to find another job was not friendly btw this place doesn t care about your 2nd amendment rights there is a sign post at the door spend your elsewhere
  this place is a hidden jem just off the strip it s a new favorite and i ll go back time and time again this is the place if you want to settle in with a couple bottles of wine and are in no hurry if you have a time constraint then this might not be the best the waiter has been in the business for years and has tons of amazing stories to share even the bus boy is personable and interesting classic traditional and cozy amazing atmosphere
  we wouldn t go back the food was overly priced and not very good at all we ordered the hog burger and the fish sandwich fries and onion rings with 2 beers and it was 75 dollars ridiculous unless u have a fancy palate don t go here go to steak by gordon ramsey and get a good meal the stars were for the waitress she was great
  this place is staple and one that i frequented when i lived in pittsburgh the pretzels are always fresh delicious and inexpensive they have a veggie pizza on pretzel that is amazing and pretzel dogs they also have a wide variety of flavors for their pretzels and dipping sauces when i visit this is one of the must go places for me you can t go wrong with the pretzel shop
  omg huge oysters on the half shell best pig wings meat falls right off the bone and don t forget to pick up a pound of thick cut bacon from the butcher shop
  i live close by and get delivery often almost everything i ve tried from here is beyond amazing i m vegan and gf and there s tons of options even for me the only reason they don t get five stars from me is because on many occasions they ve messed up my order and forgot to bring a few things they bring the items asap but don t give me a refund or anything like that even so it s worth it to me for their delicious food
  not being from around here i decided to try one of the best reviewed places on yelp there are three locations for pizzeria bianco and the other two don t seem to garner good reviews this one is in downtown and i decided to get a pizza from here rather than the closer location from my hotel i had expected to wait at least 15 minutes for my pizza to get cooked staff is very courteous and attentive it felt like just 5 to 7 minutes that it was ready wow maybe it s the time i was occupied paying for my order with that said if you decide to make a trip here for taking to go you could just pay for meter parking for half an hour for instance when coming here on a lunch break i got a sonny boy without olives substituted with mushrooms i don t like olives i was actually taking this to go so i can have my dinner with happy hour at embassy suites this pizza is good stone cooked woodfire pizza is just something the pizza you get is small for what you pay for but it s really good a margarita or a cape cod drink with the pizza was just great
  good asian bistro in the venetian we ate family style and tried a whole bunch of things the yellowtail sashimi really stood out service was decent ambiance is good but dark and loud so only go there if that s what you want and bring your checkbook it s not cheap
  this place is fun the food was good and interesting just bought the yelp deal and will be returning soon
  this restaurant is located down the street from my house and i finally had the opportunity to stop by don t know why i waited so long i cannot begin to tell you how ah mazing it was i would highly recommend the salmon and fried zucchini
  first time for brunch and mixed feelings i got the veggie bennie which was kind of weird i like the concept but it s tough to cut through the portabella also used waaayyyyy too much hollandiase bf got the low country hash which was awesome lots of flavor and just the right size yummy drinks and free biscuits definately made up for the lackluster entree
  i got the bacon cheeseburger basket with onion rings it was good and would be good for anyone that ha a stomach roughly the same size as their eyeballs good stuff yay the service was good too yay
  very good food and wait staff and not your usual italian lunch menu lou the owner does a great job with the menu and food quality waitress was very nice very efficient friendly and full of energy and smiles in pittsburgh to go to school buon giorno is a place i meet friends every so often for a good lunch and sometimes a friend brings a bottle of wine since it is byob very nice they have fresh baked bread and olive oil and balsamic on the table to start have specials every day and some pasta s and focaccia sandwiches grilled vegetables and good salads had the italian tuna sandwich with comes with artichokes mozzarella and more sandwich comes with a small salad on the same plate have had the red roasted pepper sandwich and pastas in past visits all very good deserts are good and made at the restaurant
  this place is a club that serve dine ins as well where their sisig is just to die for
  red lobster is so awesome i get excited when my husband takes me out here really just for one reason which is kind of sad but i love the sunrise pina colada drink its sooo freaking yummy i ve ordered the wood fired salmon snow crab legs and garlic butter shrimp decently priced for seafood
  great food fast and cheap one of my favorite stops for a quick meal they ve got a great variety of pasta dishes and tons of ways to customize them with different meats veggies etc also the servings are nice and big so i always grab a box for the leftovers and heat it up the next day really can t beat the value
  i m worried for this little place that is filled with so many heavenly things it is located in the very back of a strip mall littered with furniture stores going out of business go eat don rafa s everything that we have had is amazing the red salsa and guacamole are a little weird but they have a green salsa that is so spicy and accompanies any main entree perfectly the staff is totally endearing nothing cookie cutter about this restaurant fresh corn tortillas made on site it s delish don rafa burrito is filled with tender carne and spicy chile s super sope pancho is large and in charge my husbands favorite the taco s are great the flautas are great the chips are great the rice tastes like your great aunts rice the one you totally love to go home for go to don rafa it won t disappoint
  you d be hard pressed to find a better place in shadyside for happy hour located off of ellsworth avenue bites and brews is connected to 1947 a more classy bar restaurant parking could and should be your only complaint about this place as with any spot in shadyside parking is at a premium you can design your own pizza or choice from several on the menu excellent thin crust oven baked deliciousness and the price is amazing especially if you go for happy hour when almost everything is half off that s right and that is a deal that you can t find at almost any other place nearby they have a really great deep selection of craft beers here i always try something new or different each time i m here honestly bites and brews might just be my first choice for happy hour and for pizza
  i loved this place came here for my birthday dinner and it was fabulous i loved the atmosphere with the stone candles and the old books the service was excellent i tried a few small plates and a few wines i liked the wines by the glass list they have 2 5 ounce pours or 5 ounce pours i tried the smelts watermelon duck confit salad all were good the watermelon was inventive and had a lot of flavors going on definitely a good place to come hungry and try a lot of different things the waitress was awesome she had great wine recommendations and was on the ball i can t imagine switching between 2 languages and managing several tables at a busy restaurant and our waitress did it gracefully the atmosphere is cozy and romantic made for a great birthday
  the food was good but nothing over the top i am not sure it was worth the price of entry with all the great restaurants in vegas not sure i ll be back
  there is a lot of competition in this space i like to try different teppan style restaurants in the area as each tends to have their own unique thing they do that makes them stand out there is some nice art on the walls here which was reportedly designed by the owner the sushi prices 12 13 rolls were on the high side so we skipped it my wife and i aren t huge eaters so we like to split a main entree even though the menu threatened a 7 95 plate sharing charge they didn t actually charge it they also gave us a pass on the kids menu for our 13 year old the menu says kids menu for under 9 only the chef was uninspired only putting in the motions it seems the chef did forget our appetizer until the end after we questioned him about it we also observed the older man host with the limp yelling at the waitstaff in the back about silverware yelling doesn t motivate your team in the restaurant business your staff ends up hating you and talking about you on the other side of the restaurant we saw that too overall the fun energy that should be at one of these restaurants on a saturday night just wasn t there we did have some nice people at our table so that was a positive i m tempted to drive another three miles next time and go to benihana or for sushi sushi brokers
  great boneless wings joe s sauce is awesome on then their slices and drink combo is delicious and cheap
  great burgers and fries are okay i have to try that animal style the bad thing about this place is there s not that much room to eat and you ll be waiting on your car to the outside for a bit it gets packed afternoon
  this bar has a unique atmosphere and i appreciate the unique decor haven t ever heard of a bicycle themed bicycle enthusiast dive bar my burger was delicious also different interesting as it had peanut butter on it the beer list was almost undewhelming nonetheless i wish the bartender could expand upon each of the beers that were on tap she quickly blurted them out and i felt like i was left behind in the dust i didn t have too much of a problem with the service the bartender that served my friend and i at the bar was friendly and helpful getting our food order however was a problem we ordered an appetizer and burgers we waited almost an hour for our food and the burgers were delivered just before the appetizer was granted it was a surprisingly busy weekday night though it seemed that the back dining area was reserved for a party at any rate i really liked my burger when it finally did arrive and i enjoyed my beers i would probably go again just to give it another chance and because it s different
  just walk in and sit down in front of the kitchen window the waitress will be with you shortly i ordered the fried plantains crema and refried bean plate with two pupusas too much food for one person the plantain plate is best shared with at least another person i ate pupusas dipped in the crema bean sauce and ended up taking half of it home for later great place will come back soon
  i ve been a long standing fan of pisces and can t believe that i haven t written a review until now easily one of the best places to eat at the met and happy to say that they have some of the better sushi in town for the price also with the 14 all you can eat sushi during the week it s a solid joint for lunch too recently came in for dinner with the mrs and we enjoyed our time heartily tempura veg stellar cali roll textbook spicy tuna roll perfect screaming o roll not my favorite but i had heard quite a bit about it and had to try it there happened to be a minute amount of wasabi lurking somewhere within so i wasn t too keen on the flavor other than that great stuff cocktails the fresh fruit gin fizz and pocket fours are both wonderful nothing fancy just served in a pint glass with tons of freshness not too boozy either i d order both again in a heartbeat the service was great as well our server was nice and to the point not too much nonsense or over communication which i appreciate pisces is a great choice for sushi and cocktails also never had the chance to witness him in his element behind the bar but i know bob peters slings a mighty fine beverage
  i was excited to try to this place out so we drove all the way to the east side of town to check it out i think it is a cute concept but nothing really stood out for me except for maybe the pallea it had a good taste but the calamari in the dish had tentacles i was a good sport and ate it anyways the chicken skewers were nothing special the deviled eggs were really plain i think adding siracha to the mix would give it a little kick the sliders were tasty the dessert which was a trio of ice cream flavors were displayed creatively most of the dishes i tried just tasted okay the presentation of the food stood out though i think nosh and swig should experiment with their recipes to make signature items that are unique to their restaurant
  nero s is a nice steak and seafood restaurant with a variety of delicious dishes between all the members in our party we had the fillet mignon milk fed veal and 16 oz new york for sides we had the creamed spinach polenta and mushrooms everything tasted fantastic and no one out of 6 was disappointed the polenta has a nice spicy flavor and it can catch you off guard the staff is very attentive and courteous
  really good place for take out thai food our go to place is thai house but gaati thai is a contender i tried their veggie medley with tofu and their fish cake salad forgot the actual name both were really good these were two new dishes for me but you can t go wrong with stir fry veggies and tofu w brown rice the veggies were perfectly cooked cabbage mushrooms carrots tomatoes and broccoli and the tofu firm was nicely marinated and slightly fried i got the dish a medium spice level but it wasn t hot at all so i had to add garlic chili sauce to it when i got home the fish cake salad was new for me so i didn t know what to expect from a fish cake the texture is kinda different but it was ok for me the salad came in a crispy taco shell like bowl full of lettuce bell peppers and cucumbers with a side of vinegarette dressing that was yummy but it was super thick like a chutney so it was more of a dipping sauce than dressing the staff is super nice and the decor is pleasant and good for a date night out i ll definitely try it again
  after flying into milwaukee from louisville ky and connecting in chicago o hare i drove to madison on a brisk monday afternoon glad i asked the gate agent to bump me to an earlier flight so i didn t have to experience traffic on the i 94w and the tedious 3 hour delay if i stuck with my original itinerary i was craving pho after not having any for quite awhile after checking yelp and my bookmarks i stopped by ha long bay vietnamese thai bistro to get my pho on since it was rated high by the reviews located off of the main thoroughfare of east washington ave it took me a good while to locate this place after mapping it out and finding williamson street i parked on the quiet jennifer street and walked on over to the entrance it was nice to be able to sit down after long drive the restaurant itself was nice but dimly lite they have restrooms but assuming for customer use only the restaurant itself was a smal bistro in the heart of madison and there was some patrons hanging out and eating when i came in there was 2 servers nearby and a older lady came over after to take my order i assumed this place is a mom and pop establishment so it was good to support local even on vacation i ordered my usual when i come to get pho which was combination pho and a side of summer rolls with shrimp the entire process took about 10 minutes the bowl of pho was good and the flavor of the broth was deep and it was delicious only problem was that there was not enough noodles that i am accustomed to wish i did speak up about this and asked for extra noodle in the beginning it was my fault for not asking the summer rolls felt like they were refrigerated and not made on request which was a bit disappointing nevertheless it was good anyway overall this place is worth it s weight in yelp stars my only gripe would ve been the portion of noodles but that can be corrected easily they do accept cash and credit cards so that s always a plus clean and inviting to take in a meal by yourself or your pho hungry friends out i had a nice experience here and hope you do too while i can say it was good pho it can be better support local b
  this rating is in context to all the other great restaurants near by food was good everything else sucked we arrived 45 minutes before closing we were arrogantly asked if we had a reservation which we didn t at that hour we were arrogantly told them we could only eat in the bar area but the food is the same so i accepted the arrogance continued with the waitress she had a strange attitude the music was so load i could barely talk to my date and the waitress struggled to communicate half way through our meal they turned it down the table we sat at was very un ergonomic for eating the chairs too low compared to the table okay for chilling but simply uncomfortable for dining food the fillet steak was very good 56 the peppercorn sauce decent extra 6 the beat salad was well presented and tasty other side dishes were tasty but nothing worth highlighting with so many other options you won t see me back
  this location sahara is the lesser of the few the food and service is nothing like the maryland location which is stars above this one here at sahara the food is mostly great the atmosphere is wonderful it s just a beautiful anf fun decor the service is not as attentive and you need to ask questions are refills free etc because they might not tell you the chicken parm was a disappointment last time we went pounded down flat to make it look bigger gimmee a break and the salad was smaller than usual i would not have ordered had i known however the mousakka rocks the iced tea is good and you can t beat 25 off night overall most of the place is worth it just remember to ask some key questions as this location is more about cash than service
  mmmm eggplant so it s sunday morning and i just scarfed down the second half of my eggplant parm sandwich from last night so good and i wasn t the only one with leftovers the portions were huge and all i keep wondering is how the hell did it take me this long to check this place out what a gem decor was charming service was impeccable but most importantly the food was delicious and reasonably priced 8 sandwiches 10 15 entrees
  my grandparents are long time fans of the ribeye and i have joined them at the ribeye on two separate occasions both times the hostesses and the servers were extremely nice to them treating them like local celebrities and anyone who is that nice to my grandparents is okay with me the ribeye has a relatively limited menu and their specialty is the ribeye surprise surprise the salad bar and baked potato are included with the ribeye dinner and both are pretty good the overall ambiance of the ribeye is relatively casual and they have a lot of fighting illini memorabilia i think some of the reviewers who were disappointed with this place may have been expecting something along the lines of morton s or gibson s in chicago the ribeye is not that
  terrible service ambiance food you name it we won t be back the food is super basic and over priced i found multiple hairs in my salad all the manager did was apologize and offer me another salad no thank you our server was 19 years old and headed out of town on a red eye flight later that night all he could talk about was how hectic and terrible his day had been and how it was transferring into his shift definitely could ve and would ve spent our money elsewhere that night had we known
  a top location for breakfast ample portions and good home fries the breakfast steak eggs is a treat and inexpensive lunch specials are varied and an excellent value the burgers are first class huge and very tasty best part is the multiple side choices you are not limited to fries only i love the side salad option if you try any of the sandwiches you won t be disappointed here either have not yet been there for dinner but if it is as good as breakfast and lunch it will be a filling treat at a great price basic dinner decor nothing fancy excellent servers the restaurant is separate from the bar
  slow service and they don t seem to give a damn about the costumers they ask if you want cheese with your potatoes but doesn t tell you it comes with extra fees same with maple syrup on top of that the fresh fruits cup should maybe have fresh fruits which was not the case would definitely not return
  really very average food and service the noise level in the space at lunch was unbearable only 3 dishes on the pasta lunch menu and the ravioli with mushrooms sold out so we were left with 2 choices we chose the pesto with shrimp it was disappointing we had to look for the shrimps on our plates to find them and the pesto was bland as if it came from a jar the only item our party of 4 enjoyed was the coffee i think we won t be back soon they really could have done a better
  of wolfley and man metallica reference i came here for lunch with an associate and i wanted to try something new wolfley s was definitely something you can t find anywhere in the country so what the hey i would have ordered their hometown favorite roast beef sandwich but the waitress warned me it was quite salty i m glad she did since i don t take kindly on overly salty foods so i ordered the cheeseburger sliders instead let s just say i wasn t sure if should have sucked it up and tried the roast beef sandwich instead sliders were well sub par and basic it was pretty dry and it came along with some fried onion flakes i needed to douse it with some ketchup to help me swallow it my meal also came along with a side salad which was probably the better of the two however i found a few brown leaves and tried to work around it service was good overall and the place was pretty well put together definitely a cool place to hang with the boys for a game i went on wolfey s website and notice they are fond of charitable work and non profits coming to their place kudos then again in my honest opinion i m not sure i would want to recommend this place unless it s just for drinks enjoy
  the food is good and the price is fair my only complain is that the place was a bit dirty our table smelled funny and there was a bit of trash on the floor
  we had dinner at rp twice so far and are ready to say that rp seems to foster the opportunities for montrealers to have a high end sushi sashimi experience with reasonable prices that said we don t feel that the whole dinner was too expensive for what we got when coming out of the restaurant remember that some pricey restaurant used braised cabbage and carrot for half an entire dish boo it is totally worth of every dollar we pay at rp every dish was a surprise and what we needed from start to end of the meal especially we loved the pan seared fish in the course since having been craving grilled fish alike it feels like chef park creates meals depending on the customer psychic chef park
  if you love authentic italian food in a festive holiday atmosphere la stalla is the restaurant to try they have an extensive wine list and they give you enough wine to enjoy the evening we were a party of 8 on a friday night and the service was superb the wait staff were helpful friendly and efficient my minestrone soup was warm and delicious the grilled salmon was prepared well and served with steamed veggies that included cabbage i love steamed cabbage but since most restaurants tend to overcook cabbage la stalla stole my heart my group also ordered the lasagna and sweet potato ravioli these dishes were made with fresh ingredients and well presented the desserts were delicious but my all time favorite dessert was the tiramisu la stalla cucina is a great place to take your guest during the upcoming holiday
  i came in for brunch and was really blown away i heard good things about this place but it wasn t overly hyped up as some other newer restaurants we ordered cocktails which took a bit to make but were all delicious and inventive well worth the extra wait for my meal i ordered shrimp with polenta and chili oil the chili oil was bland but the polenta was great and the shrimp were large my friend ordered the shirred eggs it came with potatoes bacon and a creamy beschemel sauce it was bomb i wish i ordered that instead if you see it on the menu just order it one more thing i noticed about the food it was hot all of it that really impressed me the service was ok the server came around often enough but was a bit too touchy feely for my taste but he was attentive and knowledgable we had 4 people in our reservation and they had to push two two tops together but one still had people sitting in it so they sat two of us in the one table and waited til the other got up then pushed them together it was weird besides the service i ll be back plenty of times the food and the cocktails were great and one last thing the playlist was outstanding outkast busta rhymes even dead prez hip hop played before the drinks and the food came i knew i wanted to come back over and over based on the music selection
  came here for happy hour to try out the place i think your experience at this place will be based on how crowed it is i can see during peak times this place being not so great service wise that being said we had a good time here easily got a table near the bar and nice view of the pool outside had the rib eye skewers medium rare and it actually came out medium rare with a nice spice level cheese quesadilla was very tasty simply prepared flour tortilla with cheese but came out hot and nicely toasted side of guacamole was tasty though expensive extra 3 for such a small amount white fish ceviche was just ok nothing special drinks were tasty though in plastic cups not sure if that was because it was happy hour or normally like that because they have a pool service was friendly and very attentive by our server rachel over all we had a nice time and even when the place was getting full in the bar area it didn t seem too full
  low key food is ok the fried chicken is the thing to get lots of stuff to look at inside and out good for the kids
  i have ordered take out from here several times the food is just ok prices are a bit high the carrot cake is amazing
  my bf just left home and i m getting a call from him uhoh nothing to worry about he was just letting me know that he saw flowrider right by our house he knows how i love my food trucks even way before it was cool to go curbside gotta love a thoughtful man i grabbed the philly rider which is beef with grilled onions mushrooms green red peppers topped with melted cheese lettuce tomatoes and jalapenos on a 9 grill french roll comes with fries and you get a choice of bottled drinks the usual sodas water and some jaritos for 10 wowwweee this was huge of a sandwich i grabbed a fork to work it out and i definitely think they should stock a lot of fork and knives lol i liked my sandwich a lot and thought the flavors work well i do like philly cheesesteaks but i m not a cheesesteak person because it gets too dense and rich with just a whole lot of meat and cheese going on i like their take because the crisp lettuce gives a crunchy texture and tomatoes and jalapenos lightens up the flavors a bit i might be stating blasphemy for some right now in saying that i will probably get this philly over pops pops is good but too damn rich that i always have to share a sandwich and get other sides and another sandwich to break up the dense flavors i ate a good amount of fries first and i thought that it was lightly crispy and good they weren t seasoned but apparently before they put seasoning and some people thought there was too much so they re trying without i added a packet of salt to get it to where i want it since they are sitting most under the sandwich i think that s really where it can pose a problem with losing its crispness since the weight of the sandwich is on it the ingredients were fresh and quality so they weren t skimping quality to make their big quantities some of their options are wild like the d porker but i think a lot of people can get into some of the other offerings you can always strip it down if you re not a topping person theres also some mini options for smaller appetites and really nothing is stopping anyone to share some of these i got maybe a 3rd of my food it before i had to take it to go to eat a little later as i was eating i got talking to the crew about food truck culture randomness and a bit about themselves apparently they re not new to foodtrucks they ran a taco truck that went to construction sites for 2 years and have gone this new route into the culture when it comes to this business personable people go a long way it s no secret that i go where food is good but i frequent places where the staff owners are people that make you feel at ease and makes me feel like i m eating at a relatives house in fact pelon reminds me of one of my tios it was very comfortable talking to gigi who runs the orders and flaco and pelon manning the line i normally never let businesses know about yelp or that i m a yelper but it was really easy to talk to them and they were very receptive to wanting to know what people think and what can be done better i also rarely give suggestions while i m at a business since i never want to put my mouth where it don t belong and cause tension but since they were receptive i threw out some ideas that might help like putting fries in a paper bag on the side and maybe leaving the french fry seasoning out so people can season or not to their liking maybe see some locations where people can sit curbside or on some grass since that lot is really rocky i suggested to check out the centennial hills park library ymca area i really want to see this truck succeed after reading chris m s review i can see where he s going with the night time venue don t get me wrong i would eat this for lunch but i m just a late night person so i just woke up and threw on clothes at 1 30pm to catch them in the 3hour slot that they re out for the day a few longer days or maybe a day where it s late night might bring more customers a late night honker of a sandwich to end the night hell yes that would be lovely fuku does it and they re always with a crowd perfect nightcap dinner often times for night owls like me drunk food stoner food and that s not a downer comment coming from me it s a high compliment since i usually want a lot of things while in a altered state but at the same time get very oddly picky of what i would eat this would be a good one to go to first friday and those thristy thursdays bar crawls i think for them being open only for a week they are doing good every truck here that s doing well had to work kinks out i see some promise here and hope they do well since they used to do a taco truck i have to try their tacos next the super tacation once they get more into their flow i can get into following this rider
  one of my favorite place this tempe location always has great drink specials and the staff is very friendly
  loved this place not sure the name of the crepe i had but it had turkey and avacado in it and was fantastic can t wait to go back the ingredients were so fresh which is what i think made the difference they welcome you to modify your crepe as you want so that you will truely be happy with your meal i think the best part of these crepes are that they are simple they use a few quality ingredients i hate when there are so many ingredients in something that you can t even tell what you are eating so if the crepes are wonderfully fantastic i don t think there is a word out there to describe the coffee i have never had a cappaccino that i didn t have to put some kind of sweetner in it was amazing the owner is so knowledgable on the coffee they serve and how to pull the perfect espresso and it definitely shows in the drinks they only serve local coffee within a week of its roasting don t think it gets much fresher than that with very reasonable prices friendly owners fresh food and amazing coffee i hope to see this place stick around for awhile the only down side for me is that it is all the way in matthews but is totally worth the drive
  went here for the 1st time the other day off of a recommendation from a friend who claimed that the pizza was amazing got a slice of meat lovers and was pretty disappointed mostly blah boring greasy and flavorless my friend got the white slice and he agreed the staff was mostly rude and blamed their rudeness on the waitress called in sick today please give me a break i ve had a lot of good pizza in my day and this place absolutely did not measure up to my expectations i honestly don t know how anyone else could muster up a 5 5 review i most likely won t be coming back
  soooo underwhelmed mirage needs to rethink this place to start i am standing in front of two hostess there is no line a family four walks behind us and is seated never even acknowledged finally a waiter grabbed me a table found the menu to be highly overpriced 22 bucks for a sandwich get out of here i just wanted something small then this is the only cafe style restaurant in mirage and the place is serving buffalo venison liver and onions i highly doubt there is a large calling for this in vegas after a night of drinking my husband ordered the special it was special alright special and old he felt sick after he ate it unfortunately do to limited options we had to eat here on more than one occasion this is one of the reasons i won t be staying at mirage again
  absolutely fantastic wine and bruschetta i wish there was one in denver this a must go
  the food is delicious also you cant beat there lunch specials for only 5 95
  amazing new sushi for the angus area it s surprisingly tasty and varied great fusion in sushi types and quality it is about time we have good sushi around here so bring out your sticks and i pity the fool who ain t liking this sushi
  this place was superb in all respects food presentation service ambiance it really left nothing to be desired in a five star steakhouse experience and the fact that the chicago bears picked up the tab made it all the sweeter our party of eight ordered the oysters rockefeller seared ahi tuna tartare fried calamari and seafood sampler appetizers i tried all but the last and all were adequate to amazing the oysters rockefeller were goeey cheesy spinachy and warm with just the slightest tinge of salty oyster flavor beneath the ahi tuna tartare was fresh perfectly seared and presented beautifully even the standard calamari was above average warm and soft not rubbery in the slightest my wedge salad with diced roma tomatoes fresh ground black pepper and creamy bleu cheese dressing was melt in your mouth delicious the lobster bisque presented with a zig zag of cream down the middle was a tad salty for my tastes but it did boast more than the usual amount of lobster chunks i ve had better but this was still good for my entree i enjoyed the 12 ounce filet mignon with gorgonzola butter melted over it my date had the jumbo scallops with spicy thai sauce both were dazzling my steak was lean immensely flavorful and perfectly prepared warm and pink throughout with no raw parts in the middle our party ordered family style sides creamed spinach asparagus with hollandaise horseradish mashed potatoes and au gratin potatoes i didn t try the spinach but the rest were terrific and plentiful nobody was left wanting for any of them for dessert i enjoyed the bananas foster bread pudding i m normally not a bread pudding kinda guy but it stood out on the dessert menu so i gave it a shot i was not disappointed hot smooth firm with the perfect amount of banana real whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream the cappucino served with dessert was lukewarm but the service staff came around and topped it off with fresh hot coffee speaking of the service staff they could not have been more attentive to all of the various mundane tasks that often get overlooked refilling water glasses whisking away finished plates scooping up crumbs with those nifty crumb scooper upper thingies our server s knowledge of the menu and specials was thorough and he was beyond helpful and attentive i don t anticipate being in charlotte again but if i ever am i will flock back to sullivan s please give it a try
  do not get delivery 2 hours still waiting less than a mile away i ve already called they say it s on the way i remember this happened last time too i m done with them honestly the worst food i ever had pad thai was dry tasteless the panaang curry tasted like straight coconut milk that was broken down from improper heating 35 and all the leftovers went straight in the trash
  the burgers we ordered were great thats where the 2 stars come from the service was extremely slow there was only one table in there with us our server seemed inexperienced after needing a refill for 10 minutes she came by retrieved our glass however she never returned with a refill we saw her at the expo line talking with another server we had to get up from our table to physically ask her for pur refill back after we ve been done eating for a while she eventually came by dropped off our check waiting for her to process the transaction was another long hair pulling wait not to mention she seemed annoyed rude when we were placing our order the service will definitely be something that holds us back from returning
  i feel like i m beginning to enjoy too many things i haven t written more than one bad review maybe i am quite a generous customer but this place is genuinely great i live just across from here have been to the southern for dates dinners and friendly drink catch ups it suits all of the above occasions to a tee the burgers are great and given i try to avoid wheat it s perfection that if ordered without a bun you get more fries i love it the staff are friendly without being overbearing the decor is tasteful and cleanly done with quite a few prints i like to snaffle i haven t been for a few weeks now my liver is trying to behave and given i can t leave a morsel on the plate my waist needs a break i look forward to many more burgers and many more g t s here
  great place for lunch quick reasonably priced decent food try it you ll like it
  mediocre pizza
  my experience with sierra bonita grill today has inspired me to sign up for a yelp account so i can forewarn others about planning a party at this establishment i have been using yelp for years but never felt motivated enough to actually get an account until today about 1 1 2 weeks ago a friend and i were enjoying happy hour and i thought hey they have a great patio i should do my going away happy hour here i have lived in the valley for 13 years and wanted a low key place in mid town to see my friends one last time i spoke with the hostess who said the manager would give me a call to finalize the details a week and a helf went by no call after i had posted this location on facebook and had 20 rsvps i called sierra bonita and spoke with a manager who shall remain nameless but if i were the owner i would fire this is when i was informed that in order to use the patio you need to spend 600 that s a lot of happy hour drinks i said that i could not guarantee this i asked if a group of people just came to happy hour with out a reservation and we did not have the patio exclusively for us is that was ok this is when i was told that i would still have to pay the 600 to use the patio i was told and i quote well most people don t show up in a group that big and if they did we would not allow you to come in wtf i then asked so you would rather have an empty patio on a friday night than have 20 people who would be buying food and drinks for 2 hours i was then told that if we showed up in a group that big with no reservation we would be turned away i then said kindly ok thank you i think i will choose another location for my party i know there are lots of options in phoenix for happy hour and although sierra bonita does not want our patronage any other location would be welcoming in this economy i cannot believe that a small independently owned establishment would turn away a group of 20
  sorry jimmy but our experience sucked came in with a group at 7pm left with hungry pissed off people at 10pm servers totally overworked and no way responsible for our experience kids ordered bacon cheese burger something like 16 it better be a damn good burger rally s is way way way better and i think bigger fries were droopy and tasteless i ordered a salad with shrimp thinking i would get a salad with shrimp what i got was a head of iceberg lettuce the size of my fist spit into 4ths with 2 grape tomatoes and 2 slices of cucumber dressing and 6 very tasty shrimp this too was priced about 18 00 a side salad was bigger and only around 4 bucks jambalaya was good have to admit that hubby s table mate had to send his steak in 3 times at about 20 minutes each time to get it medium well came bloody rare 3 times finally he just asked for it to be made well done and when they finally got it to him it looked like a fine pair of moccasins i dearly hope he didn t have to pay for that but by then it was 10pm and we were tired and leaving
  owners and workers are so kind food is fantastic and thai is my favorite so i ve tried out many places here in vegas red curry or panang chicken excellent when you order hot you get hot which is how i love it reasonably priced as well you won t be disappointed try it out
  my visit to true food was lovely as i approached the entrance one of the employees was picking fresh basil from the front herb garden flower box thing and as my friends and i entered i saw the open kitchen area where people were cutting up fresh carrots and other veggies the feeling of freshness was all around me with the hustle and bustle of the open kitchen the easy breezy yoga like attire of the staff the high ceilings and the open windows our waiter explained the restaurant concept and told us about the menu as well as dr weil s philosophy for food and health i decided to try their specialty drink the cucumber refresher out of curiosity it was a cool refreshing glass of cucumber and honey lemonade my friends and i decided to share the hummus as an appetizer the hummus was delicious although i would not dare to compare it to any authentic hummus pita plates the amount of pita served with it was a bit insufficient for the amount of hummus however there was no problem getting more pita the waiter graciously brought us more for no additional charge for my lunch entree i ordered the sashimi tuna salad with avocado cucumber tomato edamame ginger which i thoroughly enjoyed it was very light and fresh as it sounds like it should be the flavor of the ginger complemented the salad perfectly and the dressing did not over power the other flavors and textures my friends both seemed to enjoy their meals as well i left feeling good and ready to return soon and return soon i did this time with my boyfriend in tow he eats a low glucose index diet and i was excited to take him to true food because the food seemed so clean when we arrived this time the service was very similar to my first experience but as we spoke with the waiter and my boyfriend explained the low g i diet the waiter seemed unfamiliar with this concept we asked him for some recommendations and he suggested the harvest chopped salad for him i ordered the wild ahi sliders with wasabi radishes cucumber on pumpernickel the sliders were fabulous they were flavorful perfectly seasoned with the wasabi and seared to near perfection my boyfriend s salad on the other hand was less satisfactory for one the waiter didn t really understand the low glucose diet when he recommended the salad which was a lot like a waldorf salad containing sugary fruits and such secondly the salad was soaked with dressing unlike the perfectly balanced sashimi salad that i had enjoyed there a week or so before the salad was so wet that the greens were lost in there i was very sad because i had such high hopes for his first true food experience i would still recommend true food because overall my experience was good but perhaps next time we will order our salads with the dressing on the side eeep
  new menu been a while since i have been here most of the time i was here i was getting wasted with some stripper from the hi liter down the road and don t remember much except for kicking them out of my condo the next day but now that i am old and have settled down with a girl i decided to kill the old demons of fun at this place and decided to drag the new ball and chain here because she was craving something sweet and nothing beats a fattening piece of cheesecake so we went and you should go too the skinny a couple of things the menu got skinnier to say the least there new menu is fantastic and i like the fact that they didn t destroy an entire rainforest to make it the old ones i think use to have perfume sample cards come out and magazine subscription cards sometimes i would fall asleep just reading thru it i like the fact that the new menu has the old favorites but also some healthier options the skinny shrimp summer rolls the skinny shrimp taco s and the skinny grilled salmon and at pretty affordable prices everything was great and our server dan was fantastic rainbow we ended the night with the adams peanut butter fudge cheesecake and it was to die for as it should be way to go ccf 5 stars
  okay okay this place is great this comes from the stereotypical picky korean snob the ponchon tastes like mom s i don t care for the sour kimchi stuff but this is your fresh crisp kimchi the combo plate with fried rice is awesome and tastes right the korean food is right on and tastes like home i love this place plus the owner is super friendly
  the breakfast buffet was amazing i fell in love with their portugese sausage and some raw oatmeal type dish that had berries and banana it was less than 20
  so we went here during a very busy week for the sema convention they have an amazing pineapple infused vodka drink called the stoli doli sounds a bit silly but it s actually quite good they marinate fresh pineapple and infuse it with vodka and serve it as a martini tasty and not too sweet as for the food it was good typical steakhouse fair the seafood tower was very good albeit pricey at 96 but it worked great for the 6 of us as an appetizer the lobster bisque was a winner and the chopped salad was good but not great i ordered the filet and it was on par with what a good steakhouse should deliver for sides we ordered mushrooms potatoes au gratin lobster mac and cheese and string beans all sides were good but not home runs service was average and they seemed ill prepared for the convention business they made up for it by bringing us a desert sampler that was tasty but we were already stuffed the single biggest complaint is the parking it s far and walking to the location as i did from my hotel was no simple task
  i love taco spot i was hesitant to eat there but my boyfriend insisted we go and i was so happy after i ate there the service is extremely friendly you can tell they do care the food was amazing too especially for the price the fish taco is my favorite
  my husband and i celebrated his birthday at joseph tambellini and it far exceeded our expectations the food was delicious from appetizers to dessert and was priced fairly the ambience is charming and the wait staff professional the steak i had was outstanding perfectly done and better than capital grill mortons and ruth chris rolled into one we have already made our reservations for new years eve and hope to be back before then this was the best meal we have eaten in pittsburgh in a loooong time thank you joseph tambellini can t wait to go back
  i got their corn dog and it sucked it wasn t even crispy their only saving grace is their variety of shakes and drinks the chocolate milk shake was great
  we went there on a saturday night and we were the only ones probably because it was rather late the service was good we had singapore noodles and bbq chicken they were both delicious reasonably priced for the amount of food you get we ll totally go back probably get delivery though
  fish taco done son
  amazing every single time last few times i ve got the irish roll and found it was the most amazing sushi i ve ever had chefs are personable and friendly best of las vegas nominees for sure in the sushi category i ll be back of course
  good atmosphere good food ok service not worth 20 person would only come back for taco tuesday
  i m giving teakwoods a four based on other sports bars i have always been happy with the food here though yesturdays sandwich toped everything i have tried there i ate the pretzle philly cheese steak it was a philly sandwich on a pretzle bun awesome if you want good food good prices and sports it is a good place to go oh yeah dont forget free peanuts
  wow this place is sooo amazing well at the time i ate it i was blown away full montague and the original makes a good lunch not the hugest of sandwiches unfortunately had the carribean jerk flavored one which i also enjoyed ahhh warm bread not a fan of the lines though
  great place to watch a game i tried the hummus plate it was good with a nice assortment of veggies with it i then ordered the steakhouse truffle hamburger it was amazing the sweet potato tots where very good as well add their mimosia special 10 for your first one and 1 for everyone after that and it was an excellent visit if they are consistent they might be a five star rating
  if you like bulgogi and other korean meat items can t beat their all you can eat menu i love their papaya salad side item very hot but good
  the only good that came from eating here was that the bill was comped went for dinner 22 april everything was fine up until the part where people actually eat which is a major issue being a restaurant two distinctly different dishes were ordered yellow curry with tofu and seafood delight hers came out in a reasonable amount of time i told her to not wait for me and eat believing my order would be coming out shortly meanwhile a table of two came in and was seated at a table that was in my line of sight they got their drinks ordered and started to eat every so often staff would peek around to see me sitting there not eating eventually one of the waitresses comes over is everything okay everything except i haven t received my order minutes later is everything okay is there something wrong in the kitchen i m still waiting for my food her response was that the order slipped through the cracks because of a larger party s 20 order which doesn t sound right the party she was talking about was already seated and eating when we walked in and the table that was seated in my line of sight came in after us and was already eating additionally our order was taken on one ticket not two 2 separate orders so both orders should have been started at the same time my plate finally shows up but i m so upset that i don t eat for five minutes i debate whether or not to ask for the manager and again every so often the staff would peek around to see me sitting there and not eating was finally persuaded to just eat so we can leave we had finished our meals the male waiter shows up and asks how things are going she had asked for a to go container which was brought promptly she filled the container with her leftovers and the dishes were taken away we sat around for another 15 minutes no one bothered to ask if we were ready for our check that table of two already out the door while we were waiting we had a talk about her talking with management because i knew she would be calmer than i would be we go to the front and had to ask the hostess we would like to pay but we never received a bill what table was yours the table that had to wait over fifteen minutes for my dinner at that point i pulled 25 out of my pocket and handed it to her while taking her take out container was so livid that i told the hostess that she had something to say to management and i had to leave she finally came out and i got the lowdown a lot of apologies were given but no real action to correct the situation which i take as no one cares enough to follow up of the three wait staff 2 f 1 m who came to our table not once did the male member mention he was the manager lots of finger pointing going around waitress es believed since the manager came over he would take care of us manager believed waitress es was still serving us
  this is the place we always make sure we get to first when visiting vegas the shrimp fajitas and steak are so yummy and i love the super tall margaritas the food here is even tastier then some of the fancy restaurants we ve been to the service is always friendly and great
  i tried a different pizza the egg pizza with prosciutto and an egg and was quite pleased sad to discover the cfl lights extend to the main seating area and they need some music it wasn t as busy as i d like to see and so it got a little quiet which is a bit of a mood killer that s a great crust though
  i ve been a few times and the last time was just yesterday after picking up my mom and step dad at the airport they had just landed from a 3 week trip to the philippines after seeing them again they were hungry for some filipino food it s a little ironic since they just came back from there and that s all they ate for a whole 3 weeks on the most part we normally will go to dj s bibinkahan but i decided against it since we haven t had pinoy pinay in a long time i got a little confused as to where the line starts it doesn t take a brain surgeon to just walk towards the food and just go from there looking through the glass full of oily food i was actually confused and didn t know what my stomach was hungry for luckilly mom was there with me to order something so i could taste more than two items for my first item i chose kare kare a peanut butter based pork with tri tip and vegetables my second choice was this batter fish that was deep fried and dipped with sweet and sour sauce my chose vegetable dishes and a coconut dish i wish i remembered what they were but i remember how good it tasted what i liked about this place is that the people were nice and friendly they weren t just there to put food in a container or a plate for you but were ready to give suggestions if you re stuck also they take care in placing the food on your plate and not just slap it on as for the food it s not as greasy and it actually taste like the ingredients are fresh unless we got there in time or just after it left the wok or pan if so then how lucky was that after choosing your food we got to the cashier and paid so it had a cafeteria setting where you get your food in a tray and line up like cows until you reach the cashier and pay for your food try the melon juice that is so refreshing after some yummy food down your tummy
  yum saw this place on food network and decided to check it out when we were in town this summer coming from flagstaff we were a bit put off by the mandatory valet parking but we can deal the drinks were delish the food was great loved the cheesecake for dessert highly recommend making reservations especially in the summer or you ll be waiting outside as their isn t much of a hostess area
  i have had their calzones before and thought they were good but we decided to try the pizza tonight a large pizza with pep sausage onions mushrooms was 18 the pizza was fair lots of grease and the crust was too chewy for me
  great breakfast place and you get a nice view of all the small airplanes i have only ordered their breakfast but their lunch items all look really good the crab cake benedict is really good all their skillets are great too
  the rigatoni bolognese is amazing it s my favorite dish is in this place meant to post in 2012 way delayed post
  best view of the strip coolest little new mega casino bar around great big drinks and hotties all over somehow here i don t feel sleazy talkin to cougars from wisconsin it feels oh so right
  i stopped in for a work lunch today and noticed that they have changed some things on their menu there are these little u s next to menu items that are under 600 calories and to my pleasant surprise they had a 5 oz turkey burger with a salad with cirtrus soy dressing with a u next to it fan effin tastic i ordered it despite thinking of every dry tasteless healthy burger i ve ever eaten my expectations were low granted i ve never ordered anything at yardhouse before that i didn t like but the pessimism from my experience with healthy non beef burgers trumped my consistent satisfaction with the food from yardhouse our meals came quickly and my neat little plate of burger and salad with dressing on the side which i didn t even ask for thanks server actually looked quite delicious upon my first bite i was in heaven it was juicy tasty delicious goodness in my mouth it came topped with roma tomatoes which i think really sealed the deal at 5 ounces i finished my entire plate and felt perfectly full unlike most of the time when i go out to lunch and overstuff my face i was so happy that i promptly forgot about the annoying sales rep i had dealt with at a meeting earlier that morning i was ready to go back to work with a renewed pep in my step the service at yardhouse is always fast efficient and friendly although i used to have this one server that would always try to upsell shots and drinks during my business meetings it was quite awkward but i haven t seen him the last few times i ve been so maybe he quit when he realized the lunch crowd here was not exactly his demo we ve always been able to get a table quickly for both lunch and dinners i also love sitting at the bar sometimes at night and trying new beers from their vast selection yardhouse is just an all around great spot
  stick with the pizza tried a couple of their entrees and they were pretty bad sausage peppers rank with the worse i ve had anywhere big plate of bad tomato sauce with some tasteless sausage linguini and clams were dry and almost not edible calamari appetizer was very good have had several of the specialty pizzas in the past and they were very good should of know better it s a pizza place not an italian restaurant stick with the pizza
  the line was long but did move quickly we can cones and then tried the new apple blizzard and the pumpkin blizzards they were both outstanding and reasonably priced it is too bad that they do not serve both of these choices after december
  well let me fill you in this place rocks first time eating here from the moment you enter the establishment you are greeted by very friendly staff and everyone you walk by says hello with a sincere smile the decor is classy rustic charm to it from floor to ceiling the chandelier is over the top fabulous my mom and i were seated right away and everything from drinks appetizers and entrees oh and dessert were delivered in great time no long waits in between any of the courses everything we ordered had great flavor cooked perfectly every item on our table was fresh and when i took my first bite of my sirloin steak i took a trip down memory lane to when my dad used to grill his famous t bone steaks on the grill literally for me this was soul food appetizer crab cakes they tasted freshly made not out of a freezer and had a bit of a kick just thee best crab cakes i have had by far the caesar side salad was just as yummy the dressing rocked and there was thick shaved parmesean so yummy the sauteed fresh veggies tasted so good no funny taste like they came from a bag in the freezer you know what i m talking about and a lovely rice pilaf to boot then we ordered the death by chocolate cake to share did not disappoint at all again the staff was very attentive and the manager came by several times to make sure we were doing fine and even cleared dishes off or topped our tea off that doesn t mean our waiter was not around he was there just the right amount of times checking on us and clearing dishes and filling our glasses too when leaving the same every employee you crossed paths with or caught their eye they said thank you for coming in and have a great weekend bottom line we will be back and as often as possible
  good food in large portions friendly staff and good service i really like their mac n cheese and they re open 24 7 restaurant and bar is separated family friendly i m looking forward on trying more of the food
  we come here often as we live nearby great vibe great food entrees available but i always enjoy their tapas menu tonight we tried a few new items and i can t say enough about the gnocchi creamy parmesan sauce with spinach and artichokes hands down the best i have ever had ended up dipping my roasted cauliflower in the gnocchi sauce so so good come by and enjoy
  wow insulted by the manager we had just put our spoons down from sharing my birthday dessert we had not received our check and the manager came to our table to ask us to move so that they could seat the next group we told him we had not received our check he did apologize but it wasn t sincere he continued to offer to move us to another table since he had to rotate the table as he apologized i told him to not bother until that moment he asked to move we were having a great evening celebrating my birthday food was great but the short bald manager ruined my birthday dinner will not be back
  the fast pizza is a great invention some times it comes out good and sometimes it dose not the cheese sticks are delicious the only thing that bothers me is that sometimes it gives me heartburn no other pizza has ever done this
  not bad for airport food and the bar is ok to kill time the food was pretty greasy and you can enjoy it with the plastic fork and knife provided reasonable for being inside a terminal
  their carne asada burros are just plain awesome and love their rolled tacos too i have tried almost their entire menu and have always had a good meal they are clean and fast too the glendale ave location is just as good
  sat at the bar for ten mins bunch of employees standing around didn t bother to take our order or bring us water we left we won t be coming back
  my team left the strip to dine here and support a locally owned restaurant yelp reviews were right this place is fantastic little on the spicy side but they do offer no spice options drinks were awesome dinner was awesome dessert was awesome
  i love cabo the food is great i have never had a bad fish taco here love the beer love hanging out with my friends here and meeting new ones this is a must visit place in charlotte and i feel that it anchors the noda area
  tom s urban isn t super impressive inside or anything think upscale sports bar but the food was good for vegas pricing i had a drink called gin and juice cucumbers strawberries gin and splash of soda it was honestly probably one of my favorite drinks ever i had the thai salmon as my entree it came with plentiful veggies and a large filet but the sauce was very spicy too spicy for my liking as it made it not enjoyable to eat the fish was cooked perfectly however and it was still a delicious meal they serve breakfast all day and this seemed to probably be the way to go apparently they make their own poptarts it was chilly when we went but the patio looks like a fun place to eat out on they do have heating lamps but it was a bit too chilly in november for us to brave it outside overall this is one of the most memorable meals i had in vegas prices are a bit crazy but it s vegas and unlike most of the restaurants you leave without feeling ripped off
  this ihop is always busy and for a good reason they move people in and out quickly and the food is pretty tasty after a 5 mile walk for cancer the two x two x two 2 eggs 2 bacon strips 2 buttermilk pancakes was excellent they use real egg whites instead of subs the pancakes melt in your mouth and the bacon was delish i added hashbrowns to top it off with hot tea breakfast is served
  i was at the social media day gathering at the ritz carlton and found this place on the veebow app s nearby feature the place was empty so i sat at the bar and ordered a couple of happy hour drinks the bartender maureen recommended the a pork taco plate wi rice and beans i wasn t expecting the tacos to have mangos but it was a nice touch i ll keep it simple food was great service was great ambiance was cool they had art for sale on the walls and even better the two beers on tap are my favorites shock top and landshark i ll definitely be back
  don t bother the owner fired the cook and staff and brought in new people this place is doomed
  delicious drinks and dining are always impeccable never have had a bad experience this is a once a month sunday dinner with the girls event the margaritas are delicious the corn bread in the pan adds a little country to the dining experience the service has always been on point drinks refilled before anyone passes by and i have to ask the cadence of appetizers entrees and desserts is always great never have to rush to finish my salad or finagle plates around on the table
  a half pound beef burger cooked to bloody perfection a half pound of hot pastrami a slice of cheddar i don t do swiss on a pretzel roll with a side of crispy topped mac and cheese the name of this gastronomic delight the cardiologist definitely on my list of top five burgers ever
  went in for late lunch sat at the bar and themanager bartender served us had a caesar and oriental salad and both were good food came out fast since lunch crowd had left had a glass of wine which was good as well had a living social deal which i would recommend happy hour deals looked good as well give it a shot
  so glad this local spot is emerging to so cal and they are getting a taste of a great phoenix metro eatery pita alway is good and pardon me but phalene is just a gorgeous than life server
  it could because i came here two or three years back when the quality was a lot better but i was a bit disappointed with their selection of desserts and the quality of their entrees at the same time it could be because we came here for sunday dinner so the gourmet dinner option was not offered honestly remembering back they had a lot more food this time around there were no macaroons tortes or mousse and the creme brule was extremely watery in consistency insert sad face i thought what stood out were the rack of lambs kobe beef sea bass king crab legs white chocolate nutella cone strawberry cheesecake and banana foster bread pudding everything else began to taste the same when we were 30 minutes into the buffet a lot of people were in line for salmon and maguro poke but i stayed away from the raw seafood because it was a buffet after all upon leaving my impressions of the bellagio buffet had decreased and my stomach was unsatisfied i would recommend trying the newer buffets if you re ever in town like the wynn wicked spoon cosmopolitan which may temporarily become the next it hotel and if you re a real carnivore texas de brazil would be more satisfactory
  consistent food and service here if you do experience a problem though geoff the proprietor is spot on for resolving issues and making his customers happy
  lyrics madonna like a virgin i made it to the restaurant somehow i m made to yelp didn t know how lost i was until i found you i want to eat in phoenix i d been had i was hungry and blue but you made me feel yeah you made me feel happy and full beckett s table tried for my very first time beckett s table when bo bites eats next to rhyme beckett s table is located in the heart of what i call a food mecca next to crudo s the market by jennifer s and the vig anyways i came here for a quick dinner bite with some friends my partner and i decided to share since we weren t that hungry we went for the house made ricotta berry salad and the tuscan shrimp needless to say the salad was well plated and an artwork to look at eat with your eyes first they say and indeed we did the salad was plated more like a charcuterie board with a sweet strawberry puree dotted on the side we mixed it with the arugula and spiced pistachios and soft semi goowy ricotta cheese overall a good start to wet the palate for things to come our entree came as a soup shrimp sausage roasted tomatoes and beans and atop with a parmesan crustini i thought this dish was good but it was nothing too exciting i thought it needed some heat and some extra crunch i appreciated the beans but later thought i need some more texture in the end beckett s table is still a place that deserves my love i love the rustic american feel and open kitchen the place is warm and welcoming service seems knowledgeable and definitely on top of things i drink a lot of water and not once was my water glass empty enjoy
  this place is a well kept secret of the wynn not only is it decently priced but the selections are spectacular try the wings perhaps the best in the city i was actually there on a casual date and was worried that it might seem a bit to casual it turned out to be the right amount of amiance for getting to know someone the place lends itself to great conversation and a good time
  another addition to the japanese ramen houses in vegas shoku falls just a little short of the couple of other ramen places that i really like located next door to bachi burger the place has a nice ambiance and a fresh upper class atmosphere the service is top notch as well don t be afraid to take a date here i ordered the lobster ramen 16 which was the most expensive ramen on the menu i was just too intrigued to pass it up there were four nice big chunks of lobster in this ramen in the words of borat very nice overall the ramen was good but not great i didn t find myself unable to stop eating the noodles were slightly over cooked the chashu was average tasting and just a filler the fillers in general weren t bad the corn the seaweed etc but there was something not quite in balance with the broth it may have been the half a spoon garlic i added to it or maybe it was too salty the broth absorbed the lobster flavor which i liked at first but as i ate it something just didn t work for me shoku ramen ya is a nice place to go if you live in that area but i probably won t be seeking it out myself
  beware food dye in soup only 2 of their soups were labeled an all natural hmm so what makes the tomato soup not receive the all natural label of course i asked seemed to be the shift manager that day in the salad bar area said she would check for me but acted quite annoyed to have to go through the process i did not want to bother anyone but if i am going to be eating something and or feeding it to my child i would certainly like to know what the heck is in it she let me know that the tomato soup has red and blue food dye seriously paradise have they never seen the studies that food dyes are dangerous for kiddos it is really frustrating when businesses advertise something that is seemingly healthy ish don t get me wrong i assumed there was some cream but really they are throwing scary additives moral of the story visit the local restaurants who make things from scratch and don t need to dye their tomato soup to make it red tomatoes are red
  leticias has become my favorite mexican restaurant everything i ve had has been excellent the burritos are the best anywhere and are huge and i highly recommend trying the quesotaco the staff is very friendly and are very helpful when you have questions my family will definitely make this place a regular visit
  i just went to this restaurant after it opened the problem is not really with the food but with the atmosphere the music was extremely loud no one could talk to each other at our own table another issue was how they were serving the beer they bought us a beer that had the top of the head a good half inch to inch below the top of the glass this was consistent for all 3 of our beers one person in our group mentioned this to the server that delivered them and we were told this was the proper way it was to be served after we looked at all the other beers being brought out they were all with the head at the top of the glass we spoke to the manager about it when he came by to check on us and he said again that ours were served properly we showed him all the other beers and he said huh it would seem that a new place would be interested in feedback and try to take it in a little better than in a more confrontational way the food was good the majority of us had wings they had a ton of flavors which was nice unfortunately you have to order a minimum of 6 of a flavor so it doesn t leave much opportunity for experimenting i had the caribbean jerk and the parmesan they were good just not enough to really entice me to come back there are some other places near by with great wings and we can actually talk to each other when we go
  great lunch specials but they add a gratuity of their choosing to to go orders and will not remove it shady as hell won t be back
  while some of the food was very tasty the oil used to fry the food tasted rancid or at the very least needed to be changed for fresh oil many of the items on the menu looked interesting so maybe i need to give blue adobe another try
  don t waist your time unless you plan on going home hungry the portions are so small the food isn t even that good not worth the money we went there for dinner and we were disappointed and thought we would try their brunch and i had to ask for bread because the eggs benedict was so small i get full so fast and never eat an entire meal but this was ridiculous
  this place has decent sushi nothing to drive far for but their happy hour is great and for some reason i love there chicken wings
  im going to say that i really love upstairs more because it is a little more mellow i love that one can use http counterless com and order food to the usrlib the peanut butter and bacon sandwich sold me i am very spoiled by sambalatte and coffee wise they just don t compete
  price slightly on the high side for a sandwich shop taste tipping the freakin scales all kinds of good the capastrami is out of this world if you think you can eat a small get a medium you ll thank me after your last bite the bobbie is a very strong second that first bite makes you feel like it s the 4th thursday of november the other specials are good but definitely try those two first i could go on and on about how good the sandwiches are but i think i ve hyped them enough satisfaction expectation quality
  very french and i loved that i did not know what half the menu meant not your typical fare delicious filet and amazing dover sole a la meuniere cooked perfectly definitely did not go home even thinking about attempting to duplicate that perfect and special
  wonderful italian restaurant with a homey feel to it went here with my girls as our last dinner place while in vegas our waiter was one of the sweetest and most attentive waiters i ve ever had the owner came to our table at one point because it was a bachelorette gang and we asked for shots to be poured into cheesy diamond ring shaped shot glasses he was super sweet and told us a bit about the family owned restaurant the wait for the food wasn t long at all i ordered the polpettine and the meatballs were amazing we were very much all stuffed by the end
  great spot for chilin drinking wine or for date night nice large patio and inside decor is dark and comfy with couch seating as well as tables most of the eats are good especially bruschettas bit pricey place but normal for these type deals
  probably the best meal i have ever had came on a weekday evening and they had a chef tasting menu available with 9 courses we were definitely full one of our friends did not eat raw fish and they were able to accommodate that service was great always had bread on our plates as well as the water was also refilled servers were passionate to serve us and entertained us be prepared to be here for 3 hours 1st course mini oyster with miso custard and caviar our friend had lobster salad 2nd sushi course with raw salmon 3rd white asparagus salad 4th sweet pea puree 5th truffle risotto 6th halibut with shrimp and sweet peas 7th colorado lamb with duck the duck was my favorite 8th mashed blackberries with lemon sherbet 9th deconstructed strawberry shortcake we will be back next time we are in vegas hopefully they have the tasting menu available
  i ve never had the burritos but what a great spot for a couple tacos i stroll over from a neighboring residential building weekly for a fish taco and or one of the others on the menu it is quick and delicious as for the parking people mention i walk but there is the small lot connected to the building a lot across the street with plenty of space i think it is shared with common market and plenty of street parking within a block or two in either direction you can even park in the south blvd street spots and walk across the light rail tracks and be here in no time
  new spot one of those great small finds we will be coming again good food and service i got pho soup as did my boyfriend got a little less meat than we usually do in our pho soups but still a great taste
  we used the restaurant com 25 off of 35 or more and i still paid over 20 for 1 salad 1 cup of miso 3 rolls 2 iced teas the beverages were not included in the deal 18 gratuity for what for 6 more i could have gone to my regular place and got 5 big rolls with lots of fish in them 2 large bowls of miso 2 home made iced green teas and a real sit down service i d not go back to cafe wasabi there was nothing compelling about this place at all food quality 2 5 barely average food quantity 2 5 below average not much fish in the rolls what i can easily call slivers of fish on top of rolls food flavor 2 5 barely average nothing great food selection 2 5 below average they had very few fish types and most rolls had the same stuff in it just with different sauces big woop no nigiri no handrolls and they had regular sandwiches really decor service 2 5 below average cafe is a good way to describe this place s decor style and ordering method i did not care for it at all
  the one thing that claim jumper does that makes it unique is huge servings we re talking leftovers for days servings the service is usually pretty attentive and quick although there can be a bit of a wait some evenings this is my mom s place to go out to eat when she has her choice it s ok i mean yeah it s huge but sometimes you sacrifice quality for quantity it s pretty much standard chain apostrophe s food nothing thrilling their huge chocolate cake slice however rules the school 7 or 9 layers or something like that i blame it for my stomach
  hearty slow cooked meals cooked with precision are the key to halo halo kitchen s success we came here around lunchtime on a sunday and it was packed with people all waiting in line for a taste of their delicious food they offer both a la carte and combination options and there are a plethora of dishes to choose from we decided on some 3 item combinations which include 2 scoops of rice i had the chicken afritada beef kare kare and pork dinuguan while i tried some chicken and pork adobo the chicken afritada was a slightly sweet tangy mixture with tomatoes served with roughly chopped bone in dark meat pieces the beef kare kare was a little murky tasting for me with some indistinct earthy flavors muddled in with the sauce the pork dinuguan was good with tender pork and a rich vinegary taste i probably liked the adobo out of all the dishes it was a perfect blend of spices textures and flavors service was speedy and efficient as your dishes are already cooked and sitting in containers buffet style a 3 item combination plate is around 10 and is a lot of food to eat i took my meal to go and it lasted for 2 meals if i lived closer to this restaurant you bet i d be here quite frequently
  good service but disappointing food our california burger was dry which is hard to do given then mushrooms on top the buns were stale my pear salad was full of flavors that just don t go together we usually don t eat at places unless they are 4 stars we made an exception on this one and we are bummed we did
  spent a lot of time here on the last trip to vegas good times they have really good pina coladas however expensive but they re worth it gotta love a place with more than one bar a dance floor restaurant and a store so much going on the live band was good and played a wide variety of music there weren t too many people gettin down on the dance floor though but once we got the drinks rolling it was a good time they have this weird lil game right before you walk into the store with a metal ring on a cord i can t get it to work to save my life the store has so much cute stuff i found it necessary to blow some money in there too saw a guy passed out in one of the adirondack chairs in the hallway take note do not sit in a really low adirondack chair if you are wearing a skirt dress bad idea funniest thing is i hate tequila we are not friends but i had a great time here anyway definitely check it out
  el molino makes the chimichanga by which i rate all other chimichangas if another restaurant doesn t give it just the right crispiness with just the right accompaniments of cheese guacamole and sour cream then it just doesn t cut it by the way after almost 30 years in phoenix i ve eaten more chimichangas than i care to admit get el molino s chicken or machaca chimi which is often a nightly special for under 8 and you will be in sinus clearing chimi heaven
  i d rather give this place three stars so why 4 because of the friendly service i love bagels i like the selection they offer and the espresso drinks as well yes the service is a bit slow yes they have messed up my order but you know what they fixed their mistake without any attitude or rolling of eyes i like that and you know what friendly goes a long way how can you be mad at someone who apologizes for their mistake and fixes it right away you can t unless you are a monster the bagels are good always perfectly toasted and buttered the staff takes awhile to make drinks maybe they don t make a lot of lattes or maybe they need to brush up on their faster pace skills the drinks take for eva but they are always tasty and it seems that the specialty feature lattes are constantly changing and i order those so maybe it s a how do i make this new drink issue and not a pace issue now i said everyone here is nice i meant that except for one employee guess who that employee is oh it s the gm that woman is a b rhymes with witch i was in utter shock when i found out that this unpleasant individual was the gm scenario i ordered a strawberry banana smoothie for my person it s a saturday at noon the bagel pickings were slim and they still have four more hours until close is anyone making bagels bueller bueller the associate starts to make the smoothie and realizes oh there are no bananas who used the last banana hint whoever used the last banana could have said hey we are out of naners and someone could have walked across the parking lot to albertsons to get more because not sure if anyone read the beverage menu board but strawberry banana smoothie is a prominently displayed drink choice you need bananas for that and conveniently a grocery store is right there like right there my person doesn t want just a strawberry smoothie or a mixed berry smoothie so i asked to just get a refund they call over the person eating their lunch in the store which brings me to hey you are kind of busy think you can jump in and help instead of stuffing your face ignoring the fact that there is a line this person a woman goes to give me change and i said wait can t you put it back on my card i paid with a credit card she says oh i forgot to ask you if you wanted it on your card but i already did it and i am going to give you change so i asked her if she would put it on my card since that is an option she sighed very heavily rolled her big stupid eyes at me and went on to charge me for another drink on my card and had to void that one plus return the first one in my head i was thinking if this place wasn t around the corner and if everyone wasn t so nice i d never come here again if this were my first time here i didn t know that was the gm they went and sat back down after helping not helping me i was appalled there was still a line and cream cheese tubs in a bus bucket teetering on the cooler edge that needed to be put out and displayed but they got busy and the employee doing that task jumped behind the counter to help you d think the gm who i didn t know was the gm at the time would maybe take the what 3 minutes it would take to put them away instead of sitting back down to eat i went in today and the nice manager with the long blonde pony tail i wish i knew her name was there i thought she was gm she s always helpful and pleasant and i wanted her to know listen you have a manager here who isn t exactly welcoming you need to coach her on her people skills because if i wasn t a regular and didn t know that it s normally a pleasant experience here i d never come back she told me that woman was the gm my mouth involuntarily fell open in shock i couldn t believe it the gm is acting like that wow and i noticed a we re hiring sign on the window it makes me wonder who would want to work for this woman are they having a hard time keeping employees if you treat a customer like she did me and she thought that was acceptable behavior what does she treat her employees like i felt bad for the entire staff i hope the gm sees this maybe customer service is not your forte or maybe you need to work very hard on your people skills i get the impression you are new if you need some coaching on how to deal with people please respond to my review and i will be happy to set up a time to get together to go over basic customer service behaviors with you i am very serious
  this is by far the best mexican drive thru in the area my favorite is their super nachos i have never had a bad meal when eating their food i no longer live in the area and i miss their food i have yet to find a place here in the monterey peninsula that comes close to the quality of food at filibertos every time i am in the az i go to filibertos
  we ve been wanting to dine here for quite some time now i m glad we finally had the time to do so my overall first impression was that the place looked nice i had no clue about the price but it looked as if it would be a bit pricey in actuality though it s quite affordable i loved the ambiance and the service was excellent ordered yuzu chili salmon salad they had ahi poke on the menu which would usually be my go to selection but i figured i d switch it up and try the yuzu chili salmon salad the salmon is thinly sliced and is prepared seared the greens consisted on arugula the bitterness of the arugula accompanied the taste of the seared fish well agedashi tofu i love tofu prepared in this manner the tofu itself was perfect but my complaint is the broth that it was served it it was very strong in taste and overpowered the rest of the dish i probably won t order this again buta bara one of the many selections of skewers available buta bara is pork belly if you are a fan of pork belly i highly recommend giving this a try it was cooked to perfection in my opinion with the edges providing a slight crunch tori chazuke this is our first time ordering this dish it is a chicken and rice dish served drowning in a broth it was reminiscent of a filipino dish i am familiar with tenola but not as appetizing the tori chazuke was bland in flavor the chicken was pulled of the bone and is served skinless the broth needed a douse of chili powder salt and pepper to heighten the flavors it can say though it was a heavy dish personally i wouldn t recommend this ika maru probably one of my favorite items on the menu it is a whole squid that is served grilled nothing too fancy about this dish but i m a big fan of squid and really had no complaints i d definitely order it again on a future visit recommended tori karaage this was another of my favorite dishes of the evening i m not sure how to explain what this is think of fried chicken turned into calamari the breading provided a nice crunch don t forgot to drizzle it the dish with a freshly squeezed lemon wedge to give it a touch of tanginess recommended green tea waffle i had to get dessert this is exactly what it sounds like green tea powder mixed in a waffle batter and then topped with vanilla ice cream it s a good portion to share amongst two pros excellent customer service ambiance very affordable authentic japanese tapas it only cost 45 for all the above yes there was some dishes i didn t favor but overall great food cons aside from the dishes i disliked there really wasn t any negatives to this place overall i arrived a little before it opened for dinner time and instead of standing outside we were invited to sit in the waiting area that was already a favorable first impression for me we got to here them doing their little prep meeting before opening alongside their group cheer if you are big on service and enjoy japanese tapas kyara is definitely recommended tips awesome hot tea it s on the house there s a white board in front that highlights specials of the day check out their facebook page for daily specials too this place can be fun for both group dining and a date
  wow what has happened to this place not sure if they have just gotten lazy these past few months but something is clearly wrong i have gone a few times in the last month and each time the quality of the food has really gone done the freshness seems to be gone the marinara sauce now taste like cheap prego store bought sauce i ordered some lasagna and it seems they dumped an entire jar of sauce on it couldn t even see the lasagna anymore i had to scoop away most of it just to be able to get to the pasta once i started eating it it was bland and again lacked any anything of decent taste and flavor highly disappointing as when it first opened it was very good now the best thing i ve eaten these past few months has been their complementary bread
  this is our favorite little neighborhood spot the service is generally quick and always friendly the food has never been disappointing though the menu has been changed within the last year and they offer fewer options now the nachos with queso and cilantro cream sauce are our favorite go to appetizer as well as the wings in the buffa que sauce burgers are always on point too i m not a big drinker but they offer a crazy huge selection of local and craft brews support local businesses
  these guys deserve five stars so let me be the first to review it that way ok it s just a bar and grill but look we need more of these non chain type places in the area the menu was actually fun and thoughtfully planned lots of good options inclusive of some great dinner items and lots of fun bar food service was nice and not rushed our server was helpful and explained some favorites on the menu and answered our questions i think this place is a good place to go for a non chain dining experience their location is hard to find off the road but once you know where they are you are rewarded with plenty of parking worth a repeat visit
  so i finally made it back after the awesome soft opening event i attended and boy i m a moron why the h e double hockey sticks haven t i went back since brought the wife and a friend and we were all just blown away at how good the food was we checked in and found out there was a 60 90 minute wait so we left our phone number and headed to rose and crown for a drink and a small appetizer to tide us over after about 15 minutes they called and told us our table ready we just took our rose and crown snacks to go i ordered us around of the orion beer which was great dinner beer we started with the teeter tots lightly fried tofu in this sweet somewhat spicy sauce with bacon holy cow i ve never ever had tofu that good we ended up getting a second order we also got the japanese eggplant with red miso and bacon totally great the largest plate we ordered were the coconut curry grilled lamb chops they were seriously the best lamb chop i ve ever had they had this coconut curry crust on them cooked rare served with this mango meyer lemon salad just killer we also had the steam buns with pork belly another homerun all total between the 4 beers one cocktail and 5 dishes we had the total damage was around 90 every penny well worth it sooo excited to go back
  we searched yelp to find a good mexican restaurant in the area we visited based on the high ratings we were not disappointed the service was great the manager came over a few times to check on us and talk my husband had the carnitas street tacos and i had the shrimp tacos both were very tasty we also tried the flan it was excellent and was hand delivered by the executive chef who thanked us for visiting i was definitely impressed with both the food and customer service
  great tapas tuna cones are awesome also the beef cheese honey walnut dish was soo good
  pimento cheese delicious burger flat top grill love i ve been meaning to grab lunch from comet grill for some time now as it s known as the super friendly neighborhood bar and grill it s nestled in the shopping center off of park rd right next to the bloom the bar itself has a pretty comfy layout including a decent sized patio the bar and a few tables downstairs and cute little second level i will note that the second level has two long tables bordering the overlook these tables would be perfect for flip cup just sayin hubs and i rolled into comet grill for a late lunch and right off the bat i was super impressed with their specials not only do they offer a great menu of lunch specials for 7 each but they also have fantastic daily drink specials i ordered the american burger lunch special a well sized burger finished off with my choice of toppings pimento cheese natch our waitress was really friendly and offered great suggestions even though she s a vegetarian that s service folks my burger special was delish and came with a small side of fries the fries were well seasoned but next time i m going to ask for them crispy my bun was a little dry but it was really no big deal to me as the burger itself was great the pimento cheese is an absolute must here and i really want to try their pimento grilled cheese during the next go around oh i ll be back comet grill i ll be back really soon and hopefully check out some live music too
  ok service but the food is not good horrible coffee dried out ham and the worst biscuits and gravy i ve had in a long time

  never judge a book by its cover that statement has been so true and it was confirmed when i came here never in my wildest dreams would i imagine circus circus to have a top notch steak house we were privileged and graciously invited to go to dinner with the same group along with vendors customers from the world builders convention its been years since ive been to circus circus and nothing has really changed structurally however step into the steak house restaurant and its like stepping into a different time zone and let alone you forget that your at a hotel everything is structured with wood nice bar and the place is quite dim sort of the 1960 s look that you catch from the movies appetizers crab legs according to my companions it was very good shrimp cocktail amazing i believe its tiger shrimp cause those baby s where big dinner ordered the new york strip and it was cook to perfection very tasty and juicy complimented with the mash potatoes and asparaguas winning combination everything was prepared excellently you re served with a array of bread each looking very good the one s i did try was absolutely delicious dessert i can honestly say close your eyes and just pick one all the dessert dishes are delicious this restaurant exceeded my expectations
  clean simple healthy food with a good amount of variety on the menu i love restaurants like this that prove healthy food doesn t need to be boring or bland i got the turkey burger which was delicious as was the kale salad and sweet potato hash there was no shortage of food options that sounded tasty and quite a few choices for gluten free and vegetarian diets they also had a lot of really interesting looking non alcoholic drinks and i kind of regret not trying one out next time i suppose
  i was born in hanoi and grew up eating hanoi style dishes so when i saw this restaurant on yelp i had to check it out my mom makes the best bun cha ask my friends and i ve had them at restaurants in sf but practically no one in vegas has them except saigon 8 and now pho ha noi i can tell you the saigon 8 one was crap and this one barely passes the meat tasted saltier than how my mom makes it and there was no smokiness to the patty but it s better than the other option being that the name of the restaurant is hanoi you would think there would be more hanoi style dishes nope not even chicken pho what chicken pho is one of the more well known dishes of hanoi thicker flat rice noodles and a light chicken broth nope damn it guess i ll have to go home to sf and get it from turtle tower overall the bun cha hanoi was not bad i would go here again if i craved it there are other dishes here i want to try thit kho but i really wish they were true to their name and served more northern style dishes as opposed to the same old pho that is served everywhere else
  just back from here great time excellent service happy hour better spicy tuna hand roll than sapporo of scottsdale highly recommended this is a place definitely worth checking out we finally did and we will go back
  egg works is amazing place to eat a healthy breakfast great protein portions i m definitely a regular here and would like to give them some credit the staff is amazing and attentive most likely come here after a good workout session
  decided to have a late dinner here with some friends before going out for the night as everyone else has mentioned the ambiance in this restaurant is very contemporary and quite enjoyable the food was pretty good as well we ordered the stuffed shrimp appetizer which was just okay but my entree was quite tasty and had plenty of heat as i ordered it thai hot depending upon the dish you order your entree is served with rice noodle dishes do not come with rice it seemed as though two people could split an entree and have plenty to eat the next time i go back depending upon the occasion i will request to sit at the bar that overlooks the kitchen the food may be a little overpriced but the nice interior helps compensate
  really our friend asked us to try it and against our yelp judgement we said ok this place was dead and still the service was horrible we were there ready to eat but that all changed when our waitress disappeared in the back to show off her baby i m all about socializing but dang the other servers couldn t see us waving the name of the place is nacho daddy so i expected nachos not a small skillet of chips and sauce i don t get it but if they are trying to get on the gourmet bandwagon then they need to redo their menu we will not return so it looks like this place will continue with bad reviews
  a friend and i decided to walk down here sunday afternoon with her dogs to have a drink on their patio and i couldn t be happier with that decision we really lucked out on the all you can eat bbq which included ribs pulled pork and chicken while it was all enjoyable the chicken was by far my favorite part of the meal as always beer list is incredible and at 9 pitcher leaves you without much to complain about i recommend this place and will be back on a sunday sometime soon
  this is a decent dim sum restaurant that serves by way of carts i ve had better dim sum in other chinese populated areas but chang s is decent for vegas the ladies pushing around the carts are pretty quick so it doesn t take long for the carts to go around in a circle waiters were very good in automatically filling my water cup without my asking i ll come back here again next time i visit vegas and want to eat dim sum
  just like red robbins but kinda pricey what can you expect from vegas really hahah it s not too special anyways i think it was very delicious because we were super hungry i really enjoyed the fries i love skinny fries every place i try in vegas is usually a good experience and this is one of them the atmosphere was very relaxing and the workers are nice and provide great service good experience i liked their decorations
  this is my go to place for pho in waterloo portion sizes are good and the service is always pretty fast i have never had to wait a long time to get seated conveniently located and pretty nice fancier than expected interior sometimes they also have green tea ice cream which is my favourite
  big fan of ru sans always try to hit this place when in downtown charlotte fish is prepared well huge menu great prices not much more to say i will go back again and again
  love this place the owner is real kool and always remembers me when i walk in the door and i always get a1 service when i come this is my hang out
  i went here for the first time last week pretty cool place there was a band and it wasn t extremely crowded really nothing that special but not a bad venue for a band and prices were totally reasonable not somewhere i d rave about but definitely somewhere i ll go back update so i went back to the thunderbird twice this week again as a bar nothing special not that great but not bad either but i m liking it more and more for the music apparently every tuesday they have space exchange basically a jazz style open mic kind of thing this week was beatles themed and it was amazing the second show i went to had a 15 cover which in my opinion is pretty steep but you didn t have to pay if you sat at the bar which you could still easily hear the band from
  descriptive phrase fat sandwiches primanti bros is a pittsburgh staple and so i naturally had to stop in while i was visiting that area we went to the oakland location by the university of pittsburgh unassuming outside and in there is cramped seating on both the ground floor and a balcony area as well as a bar there were only 3 people working when i was there one griller and two servers it s a small place but it was packed and could ve used more help that or just have people walk up and order rather than waiter service for the seated patrons while it was appreciated it did make for slower service i had a bowl of chili 3 29 that was delicious on a cold day and packed more of a kick than i would ve expected unfortunately and i know it s blasphemy that was it for tasty food that i had my sandwich was the most popular the pittsburgher cheese steak 6 29 all sandwiches come with fries coleslaw and tomato right on the sandwich it just wasn t that good there was no taste to it at all the fries had zero salt on them the coleslaw was bland the cheese steak was just a mush of unflavored meat the only saving grace the italian bread each sandwich is made with is great other than that nothing if this weren t a famous pittsburgh place i d never have come to be fair it could be delicious drunk food and they do serve alcohol but for an actual meal i d never return
  guess i don t have a lot of experience with crepes i thought crepes were thin delicate pancakes with various fillings these were more like giant thin egg pancakes cooked on a sandwich grill they were a bit oily chewy and light on the fillings but they did satisfy my hunger ambience was good waitress a bit ditzy but got the job done mgr owner spent some time talking to us at our table which made us feel more appreciated as customers
  as with my other buffet reviews there is a disclaimer i am not a buffet addict all buffets taste the same to me they have something amazing something okay and something bad i ll save my 4 or 5 star review for when everything i eat at a buffet is amazing come here during near the middle end of the brunch lunch time so that you can pay 20 25 dollars and then stay for dinner they switch menus exactly at 3 30pm also that is when the crab legs come out for dinner however beware many people also do this so expect a long line do plan your time accordingly and well so that you can be seated just in time for the end of lunch start of dinner positives crab legs for the lunch price d i love eggs bacon sausage give me brunch anywhere any time our waitress was super nice and had a southern accent she thought we were weird cause we were just sitting around not eating at a buffet waiting for 3 30 until the crab legs came out average in the middle creme brulee was pretty good i ve had better though your standard steaks and filets you can find anywhere else i did like the one bite of pasta i took for my plate negatives the rest of the food didn t really stand out to me sushi was left out a while so it didn t taste fresh not enough saffron in the seafood paella chocolate macaron was crunchy and it cracked that s not supposed to happen for a macaron apple cobbler was super sour average selection of asian food overall come here for the crab legs
  express yourself by the rue my my my you re so predictable my little panda your calorie content should be criminal wear a bandana the words i speak could be biblical fish called wanda if presented as evidence it d be admissible join tri lambda free side of thai cashew chicken today only blood pressure up heart rate quicken ride on a pony hot mustard behind the counter hidden beef tastes phony on the board the prices are written cashier boney noodle
  a group of us came here on a saturday night for a birthday dinner we had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated inside 30 mins or longer for outside seating but it wasn t too bad of a wait the decorations inside were really pretty and very colorful a little different from the one in nyc we all shared plates because they were too big for us chicken pasta alfredo with foccacia bread thai beef salad chicken fingers and a huge omelet with sweet potato fries the pasta was a little heavy but delicious it was a perfect meal for after clubbing i enjoyed the thai beef salad because there were a variety of different flavors that blended perfectly there were also different textures bits of crispy noodles coconut shaving and tender beef that were a great mix together to top off the night we shared the frrrozen hot chocolate it hit our chocolate craving spot so we loved it since it was our friend s birthday we told our wonderful waitress and she and her other coworkers sang to our friend and brought out another frozen hot chocolate the service was pretty good especially since there were a lot of people there we didn t wait 30 minutes for our food i don t know how long we waited but it seemed as though it was only for 10 minutes
  we found that the food here was fantastic and priced well too i must admit that i was not excited to go here since i do not do hot spicy food but my husband does and we will now return as often as we can the menu has numerous things that are not too spicy for me and still taste great there was a shrimp dish that was on their special that i can not remember the name of but it was wonderful with a light batter and i have now had twice i also enjoyed their thai ice tea and coffee and the desserts as well
  the beef noodle soup and black pepper beef udon are great but they lose a star for charging for tea next to the sports book at the venetian expect to wait for a seat during standard meal times service is spotty when they get busy so you need to get the attention of the waiter best noodles of any chinese restaurant in vegas
  sir edmond halley s has been our neighborhood sure thing for a great meal for years the fish and chips bacon cheeseburger bean quesadillas and spinach salad with strawberries walnuts with a speckled hen beer are all satisfying oh yes i forgot about the apple pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream the staff is always friendly and available a great place to enjoy a relaxing meal whether indoors or in the patio
  big open area great for large get togetherness the bathroom doors are 90 see through which is very uncomfortable beer selection is good i recommend the brown bag special food is ok nothing spectacular or must try i did have asian tuna salad and there was barely any tuna in it the cashews and sesame seeds were a nice touch of crunch and umami
  first time there today after seeing a year prior guy f triple d order the mac cheeses bisquits they were delicious yet took nearly 30 minutes to get cool setting but the eatery having a pit bull adoption not cool disappointed at the establishment for allowing animals and food to be combined
  what i have come to expect actually there are some things on this menu i get a real craving for their pastas are so flavorful and the integrity of the dish does not diminish when you take it to go the salads and soups taste so fresh and the sandwiches are so jam packed with flavor and ingredients that one is not left feeling hungry every time i go i have to pick up a fresh loaf of sourdough it makes the best sandwiches make a late night grilled cheese and tell me just how yummy it is or side to a great bowl of pasta or soup try the iced tea delish
  if you come and you are on a see food diet ask to sit in dustin s section dude has mad customer service skills brought my family here for the first time to eat the lobster rolls and dustin made sure we got the last ones available for the day
  went here today for the first time with a friend who is a regular here walked in around 7pm and it was a packed house we didn t have to wait long and were seated within 5 minutes the place was smaller than i had envisioned and i was wondering how the small two top we were seated at was gonna hold the smorgasbord of food we were about to order the service was very attentive and my friend commented this was the best waiter she s had in all the times she s been here i was happy to see they had my two favorite items on the ayce menu they are hamachi kama and baked mussels yummy only downside is you are limited to one order of the hamachi kama ordered a bunch of nigiri and several more hot apps loved the unagi and super white tuna both fried and steamed gyoza were delish as the skin was nice and thin just the way i like it finished off with mochi ice cream and lychee sorbet very refreshing i was nervous about the one hour time limit as i am a pretty slow eater they did not enforce the one hour limit we were there about an hour and a half and no one seemed to be rushing us good food good service great company i was a happy girl can t wait to come back and try other items on the menu
  i was searching to have a great italian meal we arrived and realized the place was packed and we didn t have reservations we had to wait about 30 minutes i saw the maitre d and smiled at him he had a blank look on his face the girls at the front were trying to get us seated and had called us to be seated prematurely so right from the start i wasn t getting the old school italian feel once seated the waiter was on point the bus person was on it with water and refilling the glasses i ordered their famous ossobuco it was good but not great as i was hoping however the pasta and sauce was cooked excellently i enjoyed that more
  trendy inventive spot in old scottsdale serving creative southwestern cuisine with patio seating in the front and back and generous seating indoors there don t appear to be bad places to sit decor is classy and the food yummy lots of options for vegetarians and gluten free dieters i had the butternut squash and corn enchiladas which came with a side salad and were quite tasty my husband had the short rib tacos which were also nice our server was a bit odd but overall did a nice job when ordering a beer we asked for suggestions and he said yeah it s a good beer convinced me to switch from bud light while not a roaring endorsement for a boutique beer it was still a good suggestion while there might not be lots of child friendly food items on the menu the restaurant is child friendly and appropriate with plenty of room around tables for a high chair and not too quiet to bring well behaved little ones
  out of fairness i want to say that rosati s pizza has delicious food if you re still hungry by the time it s delivered this particular location is plagued by slowness and poor customer service let me quickly outline my latest experience sun 7 30pm ordered 2 salads and a large thin crust pepperoni pizza the call taker had to be told multiple times what i wanted acted like he didn t even know the menu 8 29pm food arrives delivery person is cordial 8 35 i open the pizza box to find that the pizza is sitting in a greasy lump in the left corner of the box mostly stuck to the top 8 39 i call the 59th ave rosati s to tell them what happened get the same dim bulb i had earlier he runs off to get the manager a few moment s later someone picks up the phone and says hello i ask is this the manager they reply yeah how can i help you i now have to re explain everything the manager starts telling me that the pizza was fresh out of the oven and that s why it slid or maybe the driver took off too fast to try and get it to me quickly an hour is quickly he then says we ll send out another one to you like he s doing me a favor 9 05pm second pizza arrives we tell the driver how dissatisfied we are that the first pizza was all smashed she tells us she needs it to take back with her to prove we weren t lying she also declares well we did bring you a new one what more do you want my wife tells her how about an apology or a thank you for your buisiness the driver was clueless and obviously just wanted to go we let her leave without further discussion this is not the first time i ve had problems with this rosati s customer service other times it s been surrounding the use of thier coupons both online and print since they give coupons with every pizza send them out in mailers and are online i have on occasion just assumed i had one lying around so over the last couple years have not had the coupon ready for the driver when they get to the door come to find out rosati s has a database on every customer with notes apparently mine notes that i have been delinquent with my coupons twice what else do they have in there no matter how good the pizza is we are done with this rosati s forever i d rather eat domino s than have to put up with this in a nutshell 1 the pizza is really expensive 18 00 for a 14 cheese 2 they typically deliver in 45min to an hour on or off peak times 3 they have no idea how to treat a return customer 4 apparently they have no quality control rush around damage the food then blame it on the drivers
  i just moved in the neighbor hood and i went to eat there and it was very good and i thought i had found my new breakfast joint but my boyfriend went there again a couple of days later to have a coffee and use the wifi since ours is not plug for a week because we moved before he even finished his coffee 30 min the waitress brought his bill since he wasn t even finish his coffee he didn t pay immediately then the owner came personally out to personally kick him out even if it only been 30 min and he didn t finish his coffee oh and by the way there was only 8 clients in the big restaurant my boyfriend was in shock he didn t pay for his coffee cause come on he only had time to drink half of it so i don t recommend this restaurant because of the owner who is completely crazy kicking people out who want to stay an hour to drink a coffee and read the paper or do some homework on the computer come on and don t have free wifi if you don t want people to use it
  i felt like i was eating around the world very good food and good service during my experience thought it was a little pricey then again everything in vegas is
  nothing beats seeing homemade fresh tortillas made right in front of your eyes barbocoa and bean and cheese are my favorite tacos here on flour tortillas employees were very friendly and helped me feel comfortable and safe with the staff will be back to try some other menu items my only issue is that is is a bit far from where i live and work but i do go by on camelback from time to time
  went here when it newly opened so dont remember much we grabbed drinks at the bar area and they gave us samples of their wood grilled thin crust pizza and that s what drew us in their apps sides are good but the steaks are ok whenever i crave for pizza i always think of brand
  best brazilian restaurant in charlotte we have been plenty of times before and decided to go tonight for restaurant week and we were not disappointed the staff is always excellent super nice accommodating and friendly the salad bar you can make a meal off itself and the meats are always juicy and tasty they never let you sit for long without bringing meat by and to eat a lot you know not waiting is essential i love this restaurant and definitely recommend
  panda is really good if your looking for a decent take out chinese dinner that s about 7 for 3 entrees this is the place to go it s a bit greasy but tastes just fine the only thing i really don t like is the fact that the kung pao chicken tastes like pork eww the resturaunt is always super clean and so are the restrooms great for eat in or take out the people are always nice but you can tell when they re having a bad day i love to go here to hang out with my friends and have a good time i m surprised they haven t thrown us out yet p
  archi s on west sahara and fort apache was closed on a tuesday suffice to say i went here to get a pickup order instead let s just say won t be coming back ordered fried tofu super dry and hard could be used sand down some furniture panang curry tofu super spicey after telling them no spice and it seemed that curry powder wasn t watered down too much shrimp pad thai superrrrr sallllty gave me a headache tom yum full of veggies and a good amount of shrimp but taste was a bit off wasted 40 tonight all in the trash from now on it will be no thai dinner nite on tuesdays i was punished by the thai gods for eating some where else than archi s and pink kaow my other go to place
  not sure i can much more than the other yelpers here but man this place was truly awesome if you are headed to the scottsdale area make your reservation now they are hard to get last minute unless you want to eat at 9 30pm the bar area is a bit small but it included two large communal tables for dining so you could lucky get and snag a spot there my girlfriends and i shared the table side guacamole medium level and crispy cola pork to start both were fab i felt sad when the plates were empty the margarita s are cold strong and made to perfection for dinner we again shared grilled street corn off the cob and four types of the street tacos butternut squash chicken skirt steak and barbocoa we devoured every morsel on the plate each dish was super flavorful and had just the right amount of heat great service atmosphere and food i wish this place was in my hood but for now i just look forward to my next visit to scottsdale
  love joe s had bbq pizza minus the meat since i m veg my husband had bacon burger w garlic fries all yummy but when did they raise the prices maybe after triple d came always good food just hoping the prices don t go up anytime soon 27 for 2 people yikes
  my first visit here take out was about a month ago and i had little eggrolls and the chicken katsu teriyaki beef combo 1 mac salad was not edible had a funky sour taste no bueno 2 katsu was good crispy but not dry sauce was alright 3 beef was gummy and had some sort of off putting taste would not order this combo again 4 eggrolls were just not flavorful and a little greasy too second visit was today take out and tried their loco moco w eggs over easy 1 please know the difference between over easy and over hard cause i definitely got over hard took the loco out my moco 2 gravy was a little funny tasting bummer cause the gravy holds everything together along with the runny egg i never got so sad maybe i ll try the soup next time
  disclaimer service and restaurant as a whole get 5 stars but the food gets 4 premium ingredients clean restaurant comfortable environment and exceptional and speedy service first time here and we loved it custom pizza and truffle cheese bread was pretty average the gelato was really good and not overwhelmingly sweet will recommend chocolate and dolce de leche most popular ones ranch lovers beware they ain t got no ranch
  extremely disappointed in the lack of customer service we called in an order on what was expected to be a busy for the knowingly slow establishment called in the order at 5 45 pm for a 6 45 pm pick up at 7 30 i had to demand my order after watching walk in orders be fulfilled prior to my call in you get what you pay for by way of customer service i am only grading one star because the application requires at least 1
  so all i have to say is that i ate so much of the all you can eat pasta they should of rubbed me down with butter as i tried to squeeze out the double doors
  omg we have been coming to san tan for years and has always been a great place we have brought friends and family knowing they would be taken care of today we showed up around 6 30 pm i ordered my standard mojito had to send it back once they brought it back and it had no sweetness to it i walked up to the bar where a manager tim asked me what was wrong after telling him about my drink he proceeded to tell me if i wanted it sweet there is sugar at the table omg really this is not the service i m accustomed think getting here
  we have been going here for 40 years every business should be allowed an off day here and there but 3 times in a row is way too many the first time it took forever for the waitress to come over once we were seated after what seemed like forever we finally got some chips and salsa and then the waitress finally appeared my son s order came out way before mine so far in advance that he was done eating when mine arrived once i finally got my enchilada and beans the beans were cold and the cheese was not even melted in the enchilada and i had to send it back again can t find the waitress and getting front of house is almost impossible finally the food was sent back by the time it came back again my son really wanted to go home and quite frankly so did i my dad said to give them another try i did the second time my daughter really wanted to go for her birthday once seated it took forever to get service finally someone brought salsa and chips then a huge long wait for the waitress to come to the table when the waitress finally came our order was taken and it took over 20 minutes to get our drinks when the food finally came out the beef in the chimichangas was tough i had to ask for the side of sour cream and guacamole over 3 times before it was brought out the guacamole had zero flavor worst meal ever we needed refills on the drinks and chips again good luck getting service from your waitress or the front of house i asked 3 different people for boxes to go that took over 15 minutes to get took another 15 minutes after that just to get the bill when i got home i fed the leftovers to the chickens after this i was never going back dad just drove in from ca and the first place he wanted to go was here i told him it would be a mistake it was again hard to get service there are about 10 tables and 4 waitresses we placed our order waited so long for our drinks that the basket of chips was almost gone before they arrived dad had the chile rellenos with a side of beans w enchilada sauce and corn tortillas i had a cheese enchilada w beans and a side of sour cream the chile rellenos were a mish mash of peppers and no cheese in sight they did not put the enchilada sauce on the plate forgot the sour cream the beans were horribly over salted and did not bring the corn tortillas until the meal was almost done tried to get someones attention anyone s attention to get a to go box we left w o the box this was a different waitress each time i went i am so disappointed that customer service from the waitresses and front of house is non existent so not customer friendly anymore the food is also not what it use to be either dad said i was right we will never be going back
  worst place for breakfast in gilbert horrible food this place really needs to invest in a real cook will never come back period we estimated that half of the patrons sent thier food back at least one time some folks had to send back more than once and the smug servers were totally unphased they must be used to it save yourself the headache and go somewhere anywhere else this dump only survives on the overflow from the farmhouse next door
  i ve never had a problem with this location so i m surprised by the reviews i think i ve dealt with some awkward cashiers but that s about it food is always cooked and safe to eat fast food joints vary by who works there although i can t wait for chickfila next year
  wow where do i start the menus i couldn t read a word on them that means i m at an authentic latin restaurant so i close my eyes and throw my finger at the menu and it lands on enchiladas suiza amazing the cheese on top the beans and rice holy shit sorry for my language but holy shit so good also the house margs holy shart so good the staff too the pregnant waitress so nice everyone 5 stars 5 shartin stars man i recommend i recommend peace a
  waited for 40 minutes then was told the computer dropped our order and should be out soon we left hungry because we had to get to an appointment my husband called and spoke to the manager donna who said they had been having that problem all morning she said she saw us sitting for a long time with no food but the server told her it was coming out soon if you know you are having a computer issue and you saw a table with no food for that long in a nearly empty restaurant would you not check with the kitchen to make sure the ticket was in and ask why it s taking so long
  the food took a little while to come out but they had warned us about this from the beginning i m not a fan of the fact that they close at 8pm which is kind of early in my opinion the food however totally won me over i had a philly cheesesteak with fake chicken very tasty and i am actually getting a craving for it now which to me is a true sign of a great meal i would say worth checking out especially for all you vegetarians out there looking for more tasty opinions for protein
  we had lunch there last wednesday and i know from another experiences with food poisoning that it takes a couple of days before it hits you i had a miserable weekend being extremely ill and i know it is because i had lunch on wednesday at zipps i was sick on friday saturday and sunday i m just now beginning to recuperate i know it was the tuna salads the place is not the place it used to be the food was not as good it was not clean or felt safe to eat we should ve left when i had those feelings but we didn t i should never have not had the tuna salad in a place like that it did not even look good it was as much my fault as anyone for having eaten the food brought to me but the truth is that is where i got food poisoning and i was extremely ill all night on saturday night and sunday and it started with getting ill on friday i paid a high price for having lunch there on wednesday
  everything i ve had from there has been absolutely wonderful the staff is friendly and it doesn t take forever to get your order the things they offer are unique and can t be found anywhere else and how amazing is it that there s a drive through for healthy food
  looked up somewhere to eat while visiting charlotte and this place came up several times in my search very lively and fun atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating the food was amazing we has the pig out combo platter with the ribs brisket pulled chicken and sausage no regrets on any of out decisions the baked beans were also surprisingly delightful the service was additionally fantastic our server melissa was very helpful and definitely on top of her game and everyone else who helped us was very sincere and friendly i wish this place was closer to home because i would come back all the time but i will definitely be recommending it to everyone
  hot ham and cheese oh man is it gooood jamming to good old songs and hanging out with family and some friends
  was pleasantly surprised the decor was modern and inviting the service was fast and friendly tad bit pricey but i feel like the quality of the food is worth it i ll have to try a shake next time
  we have been here 4 times now and it never disappoints the food is just unbelievable the gyro tacos and ox tail risotto are crazy good the waiters are so cool our waiter even remembered what shirt i wore the last time the deviled eggs are quite wonderful we are going to try a new item each time we go so far we have not been disappointed
  the margarita brunch on sunday is definitely a great value 16 99 gets you delicious buffet offerings omelet station beautiful desserts and house margaritas free flowing this was my birthday choice and nothing i mean nothing says happy birthday like margaritas for breakfast
  j g is so close to getting five stars from me and i m pretty sure they will once they ve completely worked out all the kinks for starters they have a stunning dining room stark modern and hip while also dark classy and elegant this isn t your grandfather s steakhouse but it s not some scottsdale scene over substance place either from the fifth floor of the phoenician they also boast gorgeous views of the city but on to the most important part the food everything we had was spectacular sweet corn ravioli chopped salad filet mignon crispy spiced onions and exotic fruit salad for dessert my main complaint is that nothing came out very hot the ravioli steak and onions were all just warm but i ll deal with my steak being just warm when it s this amazing not an ounce or gristle or fat just pure tender beef like butter perfectly seasoned and at 28 for 8 oz or 36 for 12 the best steak in the city might also be the most reasonably priced another minor issue is the service while our waiter couldn t have been more friendly and helpful kindly offering to take back our chopped salad and remake it with a different dressing when we didn t like the dressing it came with some of the courses took quite a while to come out i m all for fine dining restaurants pacing a leisurely meal but this was beyond leisurely it was slow about 2 5 hours total all said this was a wonderful experience and i plan to be back many more times for the amazing steaks and more and why not when the price is right
  we read a review about this place as a small authentic nicaraguan restaurant that has been in las vegas for years i am so glad we tried this place the owner chef norma was very kind and the food was excellent the prices are great and the portions are even better i could tell she had a following of faithful diners most of the people coming in or leaving knew her from previous visits we will returning again i love hidden gems especially trying a new food from somewhere far away this is it must try fritangas we had a plate with steak grilled to perfection and seasoned really good rice with beans crispy and sweet plantain and fried cheese it was amazing we also had the chancho con yuca pork with yuca which was also very good and came with a really good cabbage salad that taste great with the pork i probably would just get the fritangas again because the chancho was a huge for an appetizer and filling in itself if you are looking for somewhere new and really down home cooking good this is the place to try turns out we like nicaraguan food and didn t even know it the only thing a little strange was the tv was playing a wedding maybe a family member of her s or someone she knew and the entertainment on the wedding video was the music movie for the restaurant but it was odd watching someone s wedding on a bad quality tape food was awesome though ca h only here
  super great food the prices are not too shabby my one flaw is the timelyness if your looking for a quick bite not the place or i suggest ordering before you come the food kinda takes a hot minute but it is worth it i ve brought plenty of friends and they all love it i also used them to cater my big 3 0 again everyone loved it doesn t really matter what you order i ve tried everything and it all agrees with my palate cheers
  my friend saw this place on the food network or something and suggested we check it out during our most recent trip to las vegas i was down being half italian i m always down for italian food one thing i don t like to do is make reservations for dinner while on vacation i like to have my places picked out where i want to eat but it s really hard to follow a set schedule itinerary based on that i suggested we just go here early to eat dinner around 5 after they open that idea worked out great we came in on a monday night shortly after they opened and we were seated promptly no problems there for starters you get a bread basket with a tomato flavored dip which was really good along with these huge cheese flavored crisps the wine list wasn t the most expensive i ve seen in vegas but wasn t the cheapest either our server was able to recommend a wine that paired great with the penne vodka i ordered for starters we ordered the meatballs pretty big in size and reminded me a lot of the meatballs my grandma used to make my dinner was the penne vodka and added sausage to it for the added protein as pasta alone won t fill me up this wasn t your usual vodka sauce which is super creamy it was much better than that i was pleasantly filled at the end of my meal but left just enough room to share the angel food cake for dessert sugar free fat free and gluten free so a little less guilt there this place was great all around great food atmosphere and service i highly recommend coming here for dinner
  happy hour was dreadful i did not dig the crowd either not a very happening place could have potential because of the cool basement feeling however not a lot of options
  they changed the wait staff from the little blonde white girls to little asian girls that are much worse by far the worst service at any restaurant you will find in gilbert especially if you go at anytime where more than 4 tables are taken up no more special desserts no more hellos from the owner no more great sushi they apparently lost their good sushi chef and the two guys working back there now are just too inconsistent sometimes you will get a decent roll but this last time the sushi was just falling apart all over the place fried vegas rolls cold miso soup flavorless bathroom and hallways disgusting bad bad bad after coming here for 2yrs and probably 12x we are done
  i ordered the sliders three small burgers each with a different meat when they arrived no one told me which was which do i flagged down someone else to ask not a huge problem but thats something the food runner should have shared the taste was good not great and the third was cold by the time i got to it they were also overlooked and a dry didn t finish them the beer list was a multi page tomb some fantastic beers in there but the list of what was on tap wasn t there for some reason that was on the back of the food menu the experience wasn t awful but i doubt i ll be back
  great place to get dinner drinks or watch a game any day of the week the menu is huge and you are bound to find something you like they have a nice gluten free menu that includes some salads a thai pasta nachos and a few other options the downtown location is really big an has 3 bars and lots of tvs even on a crowded weekend night you still feel like you have room to breathe unlike some of the other madison bars
  went for my first time a few days ago tried a curry dish and an eggplant dish both were delicious waitress was very friendly also i plan on going back
  i have eaten here twice the food is ok edible for me i will not return the food lacked seasoning and overcooked not impressed everyone has different tastebuds any maybe you would enjoy it however for me everything was bland and not cooked correctly it was also too noisy making it hard to hear anyone talking at the table
  the burger was very well put together and had an amazing taste loved there selection of beers wait was not to bad considering it was a sunday night with sunday night football playing on all 5000 of there tvs only small issue i noticed was the host staff didn t seem to like there jobs very much and looked very annoyed and concerned of how they looked instead of trying to accommodate the crowd overall the service was great the food came out pretty fast and the prices are not bad considering the type of restaurant and location it s at
  great place great food great service great italian sodas
  one of my favs no complaints
  had the vermicelli pork bowl good flavor although the pork was a little charred great service and nice relaxed atmosphere definitely worth the visit especially since they have tiger beer yes i know it is not top shelf stuff but after time in asia i crave it
  i dined here 3 years ago for breakfast and it was really good 1 star we even went back twice that trip the next time i went back in march 13 and the food was terrible food was cold and every thing looked like it had been sitting for awhile i had 2 mini waffles and tried to eat the gross watery eggs and a sliver of pineapple then decided that i had enough nothing else looked good i notified the manager i wasnt the only one complaining it was so bad i left a buffet hungry i really hope they fix this and go back to the way it was 3 years ago cons expensive food is cold food doesnt look appealing
  the food was pretty good we came here for breakfast and the egg white scramble was good the pastry basket was excellent service was a little different but not bad the bellini s were 12 bucks each and came in a small champagne flute glass do stick with some sort of alcohol option if you choose as that was way to much for what you get i would probably come back for breakfast
  my little brunch crew and i have visited twice now and our experiences were insanely different first visit sunday morning few patrons party of 8 they organized the table and sat me so i could get a drink and some apps out before rest of my party arrived 5 separate checks no issues second visit sunday morning few patrons party of 8 they told me i couldn t be sat til at least half of my party had arrived so i had to wait 20 minutes with 3 of my friends til we decided to finally lie and say we were a party of 6 just to be sat and get some drinks i get that s how some places do it but it wasn t a packed house so i don t get why that had to be an issue drinks were slow to come out because the bar was backed up again the place was deserted so that was a little off to us but the second round was free due to the slow first round so that was very nice of them steak and eggs were overcooked rare and under easy nope we ordered a vanilla brioche for a friends birthday only to be told they don t have it even though its on the menu not that they were out of it but they just didn t have it 5 separate checks were needed but we got 3 because she said that s all the computer would let her do we know this not to be true as that was not the case a month ago i don t know what the strategy was but she didn t pair up person to person so everyones check had someone elses food drink on it she also gave us our checks before we were ready to leave don t do that you didn t need that table because there was any sort of wait we came for the cheap mimosas and all we got was a reason to find a new place to brunch
  this is our favorite sushi place the staff is friendly food is fresh facility is clean and the sushi is delicious we enjoy ta ta s at least twice each week and when we take our friends they are always impressed we are hooked great job ta ta s
  first i need to say that i m obsessed with everything gordon ramsay and was so excited we were able to get reservations for our anniversary trip here unfortunately it didn t live up to expectations i had the infamous beef wellington which i ve never had before the pastry was soggy underneath the meat and the meat was so flavorless the boyfriend had the rib cap which was to die for if given the opportunity to go back this would be my number 1 choice we ordered the bone marrow along with truffle mac n cheese bone marrow tasted like raw beef fat and has a very unpleasant array of green herbs placed on top pestoish the mac n cheese was really just ok as for dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding omg best thing hands down i would go back just for that dessert alone if you love carmel tasting sweet cake go for it
  been going here for years great authentic thai food my favorite dish to order here is pad thai they use slightly thinner noodles what a difference if you like thai food then go here only downside to this place is sometimes you receive less than stellar service but that doesn t stop me from going
  love joe s my fav is the pull pork sandwich the sides are also awesome especially the mac and cheese
  love love love this place we had the whole hog platter 2 meats 2 kinds of ribs and 3 sides we shared it between 2 adults and an 11 year old and still couldn t finish it wasn t for lack of trying though the hits start with the corn bread and roll on from there the sides were just ok i d love to see fried okra but let s face you come here for the meat we had baby back ribs beef ribs brisket and pork the baby backs were to die for falling off the bone with just enough yummy crunchy bark i thoroughly enjoyed every bite i highly recommend you take home a jug of sauce to impress your friends at your next back yard gig did i mention the tiny hot fresh donuts they bring with the check yumm our server lexi was super knowledgeable and the service was much faster than anticipated on a busy friday night
  the service was excellent food was also very good my wife and i both really enjoyed the food and entire evening would highly recommend get reservations
  i came here to try the adult buffet which was 6 per person and it comes with salad soup pasta pizza and dessert i m a fan of the price for a decent range of food but not a fan of the basic ness of the quality of food i ve had better pizza and was hoping for more than just one kind of soup and two kinds of pasta i think this place was alright they were clean and their workers were nice cleaned up the plates that we were done with they also had a small arcade gaming area towards the back a lot of people were there at the time so i guess they were fans of cici s as well for me i just went in because i was super hungry and wanted something cheap and was craving pizza so it s a satisfactory place to go to when you want a quick place to get your food and grind on it haha otherwise i would go to a higher maintenance pizza place
  the yelp reviews here are way way off they have gone through a change in management and name although the signage on the outside still says greek grill my husband and i were hoping for some authentic turkish food since it s impossible to find in the valley instead we got flat out terrible food my husband got lamb kafta that was pulled straight from the freezer i got a vegetarian plate that had an inedible spinach pie it tasted very old and dried out the stuffed grape leaves were ok but even the canned ones from trader joe s taste better the falafel was absolutely the worst falafel that my husband and i have ever tasted there were no visible spices or onions in the patty so horribly bland other than the taste of old oil my husband s turkish coffee was nothing like we had in turkey it wasn t bad but it was more like chai than the dark tar that is turkish coffee we usually like to try baklava at mediterranean restaurants in hopes of finding something close to what we had in turkey but we didn t want to risk further disappointment the service was friendly though and that s the only thing keeping me from giving them one star
  if you are looking for something healthy here is the place i always get the cantina wrap and tomato basil they are the best they also have a salad bar available did i mention that they also have soft serve ice cream
  best pizza in america that s a big claim to live up to and unfortunately live up to it bianco did not i don t even think it deserves best pizza in phoenix after many years of not wanting to wait in the legendary 3 hour line for bianco i decided to try it brave it and take an out of town friend to this famous pizzeria it was a wednesday night about 6 30pm we walked in and got a table immediately has the hype died down or did we just get lucky anyway apparently wednesday is a good night to go we ordered the market salad which was arugula with apples goat cheese and a wine vinaigrette and a margherita pizza to share the salad was delicious fresh ingredients not too much dressing and the perfect amount for two to share following that came the pizza it was good but honestly not that great i was expecting to be wowed i wanted to bite in and say holy crap is this good instead i bit in and thought yeah it s pretty good my out of town friend who had never even heard of the place or the hype agreed maybe if you wait for three hours it does taste amazing because by that time you re starving and any pizza would taste like the best pizza ever i was just glad we didn t wait that long for pizza that was just good don t get me wrong i liked it overall i d say the food was good but not worth all the hype the salad was more memorable than the pizza for a similar style pizza i d recommend la grande orange instead
  awesome atmosphere and food always a big crowd which is testament to its greatness i had a mocha and 2 eggs bacon hash nice place to study work or just hang out
  the food was so delicious and the staff was great they have people in the bathroom to turn on your water and hand you towels not to mention a huge supply of lotion body spray and perfume so bring singles to tip the only thing that is a small downer is they do not seperate your bill so come with cash they will only accpet 5 different cards per table i m going back when i get there it is expensive tho so just fyi
  i googled breakfast after being tired of everything around me and this place came up it s a cute small quaint place the menu is small but offers a variety of choices today i ordered the special of the day raspberry mango pancakes with bacon and chilaquiles plate it was awesome after seeing the plates with breakfast potatoes on then i decided to order those too it s an assortment of different colored potatoes pricing is pretty good and service was good as well i ll definitely come back
  what a great and unassuming place very impressed with the food here we got the ever popular brisket sandwich tuna melt and blta perfect as perfect gets btw this is right in front of dignity hospital not sure of the name
  this is a really nice family owned restaurant that is located on the far west side of town it is definitely worth the drive good friend from louisiana told me about this place and her food so i got in my car and had to check them out right away inside is very casual with a vibe that reminds me a eating in one of those smaller towns down south decor is very simple with touches of the bayou and it s critters sprinkled here and there the smell of the food instantly puts me right into the zone really love the cajun food and the cool cajun zydeco music playing playing in the back ground they have both a lunch menu and a larger dinner menu you can order off the dinner menu at lunch if you are really hungry the portions are bigger and there are more choices so far we have tried the dunkin catfish the alligator and crawfish po boys and both of the gumbos how can you go wrong with catfish placed on top of rice and then covered with crawfish etouffee we also tried the fried green tomatoes on our last visit the food is cooked and seasoned with tender loving care everything taste fresh and the prices are very affordable you can always add some extra heat by choosing one of the hot sauces to kick things up a notch service is friendly and helpful this is not a well polished chain restaurant with robots reading scripted dribble just great food with a fun and tasty menu use your gps if you are coming from way across town they are located in a large shopping center towards the back and the sign is a little hard to see from the street party in my mouth 4 5 stars
  i ve had pretty good experiences here not unforgettable but i ll definitely be back i will start by echoing the half off bottles of wine thing fabulous you know i like to get my vino on and if you don t know now you know i have been twice now and i ll tell you the service at the bar is fantastic my first experience i only tried the spinach artichoke dip which was just okay and had something called a tira tini for desert which was tiramisu in a sort of metal martini glass it was amazing and i am soooooo not a desert person the bartender that waited on us was very sweet and knowledgeable and let us try a couple of different types of wine before deciding the second time i went to my florist i had the portobello sandwich which was also pretty good once again not great but better than anything i would make at home so worth the trip my only suggestion regarding the food is to focus on individual flavor a little more everything that i ve had here other than dessert has been a little bland that said i still enjoyed my experiences and the service and i will return
  this is a simple little cafe diner with a homey vibe and friendly staff i showed up with my friends having been seated already shortly after i sat down i was offered coffee in fact i was offered refills on my coffee frequently and if i so chose i m certain my cup would never have been empty i had the eggs benedict my go to breakfast dish at a new restaurant i m a bit of a picky eater when it comes to eggs i like a entirely cooked white with a runny yolk my eggs were poached perfectly the hollandaise was done very well and overall i really enjoyed my dish along side my eggs benedict i had home fries which were wonderful great food friendly service and a homie vibe mean i ll definitely return
  portofino s is a rather cozy restaurant with pretty good italian food the service when i visited left something to be desired also one in my group was told that the calzone had pepperoni and ham in it and when it came there was only cheese
  i was staying across the street at the wynn and my post disneyland half marathon legs weren t really up for a lot of walking so i suggested we check out ti for dinner i think the buffet at treasure island used to be called dishes or something and i remembered it being pretty good unfortunately the buffet as it s now known has declined quite a bit in quality first all of the meats are pre sliced which is crazy the slice of prime rib that i randomly suggested was totally dried out and starting to turn grey the turkey fared a little better but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty speaking of salty i was curious to try the pho which was you guessed it super salty there is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good too bad no one was manning the counter and finally the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup on the plus side the crab legs weren t bad and i enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries i hope this buffet gets their act together soon sightly unrelated but this was my first time at ti in a long time and i couldn t stand the smell of the casino they pump some weird coconut sunblock smell all over the place which is way worse than stale cigarette air yuck
  interesting concept mediocre pizza neat concept where you can customize your own pizza with unlimited toppings which is nice but because its fast service the pizza can only be so good my pizza came with some crusty burnt black stuff in the bottom burnt cornmeal and an extra piece of hair see photo yuck only go here for a quick fix better pizza anywhere else
  i enjoyed the pizza we had the margherita bolognese and diablo pizzas i really liked the margherita pizza it s a very thin crust pizza but the crust stays soft in the wood fire oven the size is decent for a personal pizza but it is defiantly more of a traditional type pizza sorry dominos lovers this is not for you the service was very good but also very slow in my opinion i also thought the pizza was a bit overpriced but so is everything in the district over all if you like this type of pizza the place is nice and you will probably enjoy this restaurant if the american style pizza is more your speed this is defiantly not that
  small location located in china town it looks kinda dingy when you walk in especially compared to the giant lee s sandwiches a block away everything is marked up though still cheap for vegas as compared to california 2 75 for three spring rolls in the 626 here is 4 for two but hey when you re desperate for some asian yummies and you aren t willing to shell out 8 for non legit spring rolls on the strip you gotta go somewhere right the desserts are pretty yummy pandan coconut milk coffee jello is a bit too sweet coconut milk with taro yam and tapioca is super yum spring rolls are squishy shrimp ones goi cuon is very squishy and mostly rice paper the vegetarian spring rolls are insanely dry and yet i keep coming back x mostly for the desserts
  they forgot my fucking food and they weren t even busy how the hell you forget to make someone s order when it s empty
  i have been eating at the restaurant for years this is definitely one of my favorite restaurants of all time staff is very friendly and the service is great even when it s crowded i love the baba ganoush aladdin s eatery is the only restaurant where i will order this dish you have to try it the tabouli is amazing too and you should try it with feta cheese the shis kabob salad is a great choice as an entree when visiting pittsburgh this restaurant is definitely a must
  i have been very pleased coming here their beer wine liquor selections are wonderful food and coffee is also great will be back here for sure
  music from the bar so loud that the servers can t hear the customers no wonder there are complaints about service our server almost pestered us with unwanted attention trying to compensate how do i know part of our order was wrong because he couldn t hear us the food is mediocre sushi restos do not stand out by making a more bizarre combination roll than anyone lse they stand out for high quality ingredients and execution sake does not measure up
  best ramen i have had so far we ordered the miso and kuro tonkotsu with black garlic oil ramen and they were both amazing the broth in the tonkotsu was thick and tasty noodles and pork were both perfectly cooked normally i try not to drink too much broth because it s so fatty and unhealthy but the broth was so tasty i drank it all the restaurant is small and the line can get long so be prepared to wait if you come in during the lunch or dinner rush the service is fast but don t come here if you re expecting to hang out for hours highlights quick service prices are very reasonable about 8 to 10 for ramen kuro and miso ramen are amazing lowlights lines can be long so be prepared to wait during rush hours summary this off the strip gem is a definitely must eat if you re visiting vegas go with the kuro and you will not be disappointed
  get your name on the list but don t let the lines scare you away they seat pretty fast 15 20 minutes and they tend to over estimate the wait time just try to avoid popular post church service times or you will wait the is consistently good and so is the coffee the service can be inconsistent at times but is generally really good too it s a clean restaurant and a fun place to go they re great with children and their kids plates tend to be a lot but better than too little it s worth the trip from almost anywhere except maybe the far northeast or east near nellis in terms of seating just be aware that if you get sat in the side room off to the right when looking in the restaurant the last booth on the left walking toward the kitchen is not bad but the a c blows right on you enjoy
  we stopped here for lunch with the baby on saturday we were seated immediately and the server got us our drinks and some warm bread and butter right away our server was very friendly in fact just a little too sugary sweet and she did her job well we ordered from the lunch menu i got the miso salmon and my husband ordered the cheese pizza our food was out within 15 minutes and mine was delicious but my husband said his pizza was just so so and about the same quality as a cheese pizza from sam s club ouch anyway our bill for two passion fruit iced teas a lunch pizza a lunch salmon and a slice of the pina colada cheesecake to go was 42 before gratuity the baby just ate off of my plate because she is too little for her own plate still i ate the pina colada cheesecake slice later that night and it was just okay it may just be me but i think that their more exotic cheesecake flavors aren t nearly as good as the plain old vanilla bean cheesecake maybe it s because the other ingredients in the more exotic cheesecake varieties detract from their perfect vanilla cheesecake recipe i dunno what it is but i ve experienced this phenomenon more than once sadly this time i thought it d be different with the promising pina colada flavor but it just didn t deliver it didn t taste very tropical or very cheese cakey i ll just remind myself to order the plain vanilla cheesecake next time and stop being drawn in by the tempting siren song of the exotic cheesecake flavors
  visited phx for my first time and found this place through yelp i ordered the special of the week which was buffalo brulee burger one point of improvement is that they could add the price to the bottom of the burger i didn t know i was going to pay 8ish tax it was fine since it s my 1st time trying it the cashier was pleasant wasn t overly enthusiastic and seemed kind of bored he took my order and handed it over to the kitchen i did notice that the cook had to come out to see what other ingredients were in that burger i was quite perplexed by this shouldn t you know everything on your menu by heart this is my second point of contention one thing i didn t expect was for them to bring the food to your table i thought that added a nice personal touch to it the meat was juicy despite them not asking me how i want my burger to be cooked the lettuce and scallions were fresh the cucumbers were cooked not sure if people like that or not but i had no issues with it the buffalo sauce was flavorful and had a subtle kick to it not enough kick to the point where you need water the burnt sugar bun was interesting you can see the sugar melted onto the bun but at the same time you could see the crystals some of the crystals did not fully melt so when you bit into the burger sometimes those crystals got stuck in your teeth or gave you a sensation of eating sand they just need to be more thorough if i had only tried this burger i would have given them 4 stars but i tried their french toast fries the french toast fries is exactly as it sounds they basically take the corners of the bread turn it into french toast then deep fry it and put powdered sugar on it they also give you a side of syrup which was very watered down i think the fries would have tasted a lot better if they had more bread component than just the edges you can definitely taste the oil on these things so it should be toned down a bit the decor was alright the light fixtures were kind of odd and not sure what they were trying to go for they do have good food photos of their products though the bathroom was okay not terribly dirty very spacious but wished it would be a lot brighter inside despite the 3 stars i would definitely come back here again and would recommend this place with the caveat that not everything is up to par
  updating my review here the pizza and wings are great but i don t know if i can keep coming back why no gloves during food prep this mohawk guy is picking in his ears and building my family s pizza girl at the front is handling money and cutting fresh celery i love this place but i hate to see gross things happening with my food
  went on sunday 12 13 15 at 6pm sat in the car for a few minutes confused because the writing on the door says they close at 5 but the lights were on and there were people inside ordering a quick trip inside to ask their hours revealed they are open til 9 tonight but the hours are changing next week weird but understandable i have been wanting to try this place since i sampled their chowder at the redline rendezvous yelp event 35 03 got us a pho dip fried brussel sprouts korean chicken wings two small fountain drinks a thai chowder and some potato salad i watched the runner take my chowder to another table and after they denied ordering it he took it back to the window and it sat there for a few minutes before he finally brought it over i suppose he didn t think i noticed it was just as good as i remembered though kinda reminds me of tom yum soup with potatoes clams and swine it really hit the spot on this cold night sweet and sour korean chicken wings were promising at first because they had a crispy outside and very good flavor but were full of raw yellow fat which i can t stand at all i really did like the outside which was sticky and sweet but spicy and wonderful brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly but were drenched in some kind of odd seasoning that ruined it if they would just cut the amount of seasoning in half they would be good pastry case was completely empty not sure if you have to get there early to have the privilege of eating them or not bathroom could use a cleaning there was a ball of hair stuck to the toilet and black marks all over the bottom of it the sink had calcium and lime buildup on the base of the faucet which made it look dirty husband liked the pho dip i like the paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling i also liked the fountain jones soda it is definitely worth a trip but i do not want to eat there again it was good but not crave worthy if that makes sense
  best gyros i have ever had thumbs up
  great food one of my favorite restaurants the alice springs chicken is fantastic
  just so much fun i love the idea when i saw it on the food network that was showing fun eats in japan so i jumped at the chance to go to the rotating sushi bar at desert ridge i went with a friend and we enjoyed the variety of items edemame carrot cake asian sodas cheesecake poppers the food wasnt spectaular meaning there was no flair to the food just the standard sushi rolls really fun to go out with a group or date i will be back
  this is the second time i eat here my family and i had a great dinner service and the only reason i didn t give the five stars were minor service issues the food is excellent it is seasoned well and taste delicious the service was great there was only one occasion where we needed a refilled and actually had to ask for it but all other times they arrived before we needed the refill staff was friendly as soon as you walk through the door until you left the other issue was when we went the first time we saw people getting pieces of bread before their order was ready and we didn t get anything on this visit after our order was taken i asked the staff about the basket of bread that i saw in several tables the waiter told me that there they provide french bread free of charge and croissants for a small price i requested a basket of french bread to taste but that order never showed up again not a big issue but still a valid one when you are waiting for your food a piece of bread usually quiets the hunger until your order arrives especially if you have kids
  i m a huge gordon ramsay fan as a viewer of his many tv shows masterchef hell s kitchen kitchen nightmares hotel hell did that one get cancelled the f word i ve come to admire his creativity perfectionism and work ethic granted i arrived at burgr not expecting mr ramsay to be serving me a burger himself but i was very much hopeful that his ideals would translate to his staff there and boy they did not disappoint though i m a big gr fan i m an even bigger fan of burgers all things protein and sandwiches really i ve had my fair share of burgers and i have to proclaim the farm burger at gordon ramsay burgr as the best burger i ve ever had hands down farm burger beef patty i ordered mine medium english sharp cheddar duck breast bacon poached egg brioche bun what was so magnificent about this burger was that each element in it was a knockout you could pick apart the egg bacon etc to eat individually and be delighted or eat them all together and still grasp the flavor of each topping in every bite the patty was cooked to perfection juicy not over under cooked tons of flavor that you could eat it alone sans toppings the bun was toasted just right no one flavor was bland or overpowering also the burger wasn t stuffed with too many toppings where it became this unconquerable mountain another item to try if you have room is their pork belly buns bao happy servings of fatty pork belly with shaved carrots in a fluffy bao best part of gordon ramsay burgr it was under 15 not shabby at all for a gourmet burger given that prices are all inflated on the strip you could ve gone to mcdonald s or panda express and almost paid the same amount for crappy food in conclusion eat here especially before a night out of clubbing drinking your body will thank you
  maybe it was the mood i was in but i really don t think love is too strong a word to describe my feelings about fern we live in raleigh and i sure wish we had a place like this here i d happily pay 8 for a juice smoothie that healthy and good and bless them they made me love kale chips both my husband and i had the spinach fritata with marinated tofu really freakin good cucumber water mmmm made me so happy this place did
  my wife and i went to the show this past saturday 7 30 the show was great the atmosphere was very trendy and the staff makes you feel very welcome all of the entertainers were awesome and really do a great job at interacting with the crowd we didn t have dinner but i can say drinks were pretty expensive but hey its the cosmopolitan it s expected the only issue that we had was how inconvenient it was to get out of your seat we sat in the padded bench seating area and the chairs infront of us were so close that there s no way a shorter person would be able to see over the person in front of them it was also such a pain to get past people to go to the bar because you basically had to step on all the people in your row just to get out that was very annoying not only to us but others in our row so get an aisle seat
  pros the interior is very well designed the atmosphere is fun the food is good and the staff is friendly cons the service is very slow i go in often on my lunch break and more than once i ve waited over 30 minutes for my order to come out this is in the middle of the afternoon when the place is practically empty and the food still takes forever and a day to arrive when they are busy ordering or having a drink refilled can take over 20 minutes and we all know that nothing kills a good time faster then waiting an eternity for another drink the last time i went in here on a thursday night i told the waitress i needed a minute to look over the menu she left me and never came back i spent over an hour sipping a beer with a menu in front of me and never even had an opportunity to place my order in fact i didn t see my original server again all night as another waitress brought me my check i see a lot of potential in this place they are friendly fun and imho a great place to hang out but they need to get on point with their service or i m going to find another place to spend my time
  my cousin said i needed to try this local place boy was it good the spinach in my omelet was so fresh my brother and biscuits and gravy and it was very good diff than bob evans sausauge gravy tasted really fresh and like there was sage in it the home fries were not too greasy just perfect portions are so big we got to eat breakfast again later this place is really really small go early and if there is a wait make sure you sign your name outside the front door and take a seat and take in downtown gilbert
  went to check this place out because of a groupon very happy with the place i had the meatball pizza and although it wasn t anything to write home about it still was a good meal the best part for me of course was seeing all of the seattle memorabilia ahhh i miss seattle sometimes of course not the rain though lol all in all a good place to check out
  my 1st time here take out great friendly service and only about 5 6 min wait all food was great and would have got 5 stars but they forgot my rolls boooo i will be back though
  holy smokes this steakhouse deserves all four diamonds and more the food drinks and service are far beyond anything else i have experienced the steaks should never be ordered beyond medium rare or you will ruin them the gazpacho with crab meat was great with a nice kick to it i had a swordfish steak that was more fantastic than any piece of fish i ve ever had the chocolate croissant bread pudding blew my mind seriously drop dead delicious i wish i could have a whole dinner of it hank s is number 1
  five of us had a wonderful meal here last night we began with the antipasto platter and bruschetta with homemade ricotta delish wish they were a bit bigger hubby had swordfish nice portion and cooked perfectly kids all had pasta dish the rigatoni with peas and pistachios and the gnocchi all were pleased and stuffed afterward i had the panzanella salad and grilled shrimp had an amazing red sauce we had three desserts lemon cheesecake chocolate bread pudding and tiramisu i couldn t tell you which i liked best all fabulous
  the only reason i go to jack in the box is for there jalapeno poppers sooooo delicious i crave these things i ve tried these at every other fast food place sooo not the same there jalapeno poppers are always hot and fresh with just the right amount of spiciness i like this location because there fast and very generous with the ranch dressing
  my wife and i eat here frequently family atmosphere homey feel we get the same thing all the time pha is our comfort food staff are like old friends they remembered our routine pretty quick
  1 front desk girls are terrible 40 min wait at lunch with tables open 2 the servers are completely clueless 3 the managers look lost 4 the bar is a constant mess and totally unorganized 5 the food is better at olive garden dont waste your time here i promise you will regret it they will be out of business by this time next year lol i received a compliment badge by someone from crave and they tried to get rude because i left a negative review lmao how about you educate your staff instead of arguing with your customers you asked me if i knew how to run a restaurant in your rant i m a jwu graduate and i clearly know more than you i had one of the worst dining experience in your establishment you can look at my record here on yelp i rarely complain so please stop harassing customers shawn and focus your time on improving your yelp rating thanks lol
  everything about this place was amazing food selection and quality service bustling vibe etc experience here will be something you never expected from a mexican restaurant tacos de camarones deep fried shrimp tacos was super tasty parking lot is huge but it s always packed you ll see why on your first visit
  don t be frightened by the outside or the dining room this place has authentic mexican food the chicken tacos are great the hot sauce is even better i haven t had food like this since i was in mexico the staff is super friendly and eager to serve we will be back if they clean up the place a bit i would have given 5 stars
  for everyone s sake of a possible future trip to sushi ken let me just tell you now dont 1 star for location close to home 1 star for clean water glass and not bad tasting tap water total 2 stars notice there are no stars for their food i read a number of reviews before coming here and so many people raved about this being the best japanese food in the valley well i can assure that does not include their sushi that s all i got they should probably change their name btw and it truly was just bad yes it was edible but hardly another reviewer mentioned that when getting his rolls he didn t pay attention to them making the rolls because he was eating his miso soup and edamame well i fell prey to this as well the first part of my spicy tuna roll was pretty good but the pieces were overly large 4 of them compared to the other 4 when i finally reached the other 4 pieces i noticed the consistency changed the rice was hard and chewy and the tuna was dry and just not appetizing i also ordered a california roll the crab was dry the avacado was brown and again the rice was hard now sir who is making my sushi rolls right in front of me how many times did you have to sneak each piece over to complete my order without me seeing knowing i saw you make my to go order fresh as i watched you the entire time not cool do yourself a favor and try another sushi place i can t speak for anything else but their sushi but i would not recommend this place to one single person not even a person i hated and to be quite honest i feel as though i should take a star away for as awful as i feel right now i didn t even finish 2 rolls there is no reason for me to feel this way just saying
  amazing steak best in the valley for sure service was fantastic and seafood tower was crazy
  this is at the end of the strip closer to the david lawrence convention center we went here for my birthday and took advantage of the big burrito group coupon we were greated by friendly staff and i love the decor of the restaurant they serve delicious bread when you sit down and continue to come back to see if you want more the waitstaff and busers were very attentive and non intrusive as an appetizer we had smoked elysian fields farm lamb tacos 10 and goat cheese agnolotti 9 which were both delightful for dinner i ordered the seafood tasting 36 salmon crab cake and sea scallops which was plenty of food my husband ordered the halibut which was really good but is now off the menu to end the meal we finished with the cannoli 8 which was more amazing that i can even describe it appears on the menu that they changed it based on the season but i would go with whatever they recommend
  i went there twice only for some drinks on the rooftop bar the first time the service was perfect the waiters were quick and so nice maybe because it was on a week day the second time it was a disaster we went there on a friday night the waitress asked us to move because the table was finally reserved and none of them was at least polite also while the view is outstanding to me the drinks are quite expensive 15 for a mojito
  super close to home nice outdoor seating good food my 2 5 year old son isn t a huge fan of the food cause it usually comes out a bit hot he gets frustrated etc but he loves the salsa the staff is always pleasant
  not impressed with the quality of the food ordered the 2 pc fish chips no seasoning the breading separated from the fish highly priced
  this place is one of my favorites great happy hour convienient valet and the food is excellent i reccomend the pork sandwich however my only complaint is they got rid of the charcuterie on the menu i was really distraught over that as i had been craving it oh well plenty of other good stuff there to eat
  i love the university city area since this is where we chose to move about 11 years ago i have been eating at fiesta maya for so long i can t even remember when it opened and i have outlasted all but one of the servers and a manager as there has been a change in manager in the last year from the original when it opened when we moved here i asked about a mexican restaurant and was disappointed by all that i was recommended monterrey azteca zapatas and another that i don t even think is open anymore i had given up on finding a mexican restaurant that i would like up here and then fiesta maya opened i was so happy the enchiladas suiza are very good for the review criticizing the sauce how do you think they make a monterey jack cheese sauce they also have sour cream on top along with the guacamole salad and rice the lunch specials are your standard fare speedy gonzales burrito taco rice etc but are at a very good price the enchilada verdes is made with a good tomatillo sauce i am picky about my green sauce and the fajitas are good as well though they don t have the most taste with the meat refried beans are solid tacos have plenty of yummy monty jack on top and the brown sauce on the regular enchiladas is good too the new manager brought in a new cook i think because some of the items are made a little better than before and maybe changed the food service company i have been in when the chips are stale but then they aren t made fresh on site either and the salsa is pretty good we are regulars so they make a comment about missing us when several weeks go by and we haven t been in i would think that description right there would suffice to say all you need to know about the quality of this restaurant but then what you are looking for may be different than myself they are friendly and i usually have the same two waiters for the price you can certainly afford to give it a try i don t think you will be disappointed
  yum so good great service and food came quickly despite being really busy during lunch we loved it salads are great and you can t miss the bruschetta
  smoke is known for their barbecue inspired tacos which are delicious especially the chicken apple my personal fav but their mac cheese and queso are items on their menu not to be missed i know that sounds like a lot of cheese this is coming from someone who really loves cheese but you only live once so double up or you ll just have to go again and again
  nice atmosphere great service good wine and amazing food
  staff needs to understand there boundary for delivery one person will deliver and next person say they can t deliver very frustrating
  awesome place they always have great beer on tap and an amazing take on a traditional british dish
  i love all panera equally i am def a fan of this easy better than fast food time killing eatery great place for a lunch social date with good eats and a good place to sit and talk for a while or to get some work done between appointments pros great food free wifi though some locations are limited to 30 minutes during the lunch hour seating is always tricky at the lunch hour cons pricey for salads soup and sandwiches tables should be wiped more frequently even if you have to ask a newly seated guest if they would like it wiped the tables should be wiped for pete s sake give a fork with the mac and cheese not a spoon lol
  absolutely love this place some of the best pizza you will try the owners are absolute sweethearts and the food is to die for everything from the pizza to the pasta to the poppers you guys are fantastic
  love me some hana seriously great quality sushi and byob it doesn t get better than that period the service has always been great for us and they do a great job explaining what s freshest and new to try it s so neat that it s in our neighborhood and we can wander on over with a bottle of wine and stumble on home with full happy bellies
  simple the best all the right flavosr and freshness concept decor and amazing food love the wow lomito and chicken is moist a lots of flavor just like on the best places in peru
  dirty tap lines are the norm here they had an orange hefe weizen once and every beer that replaced it on that tap line has had an orange taste often it s something quite obvious like a pilsener where the orange comes right out there s a putrid sewer smell that won t go away from this location i m not sure if it is too costly to get rid of it but it is there every time i ve made a visit in hopes that the place will improve menu is pretty much the same as all the other old chicago chain restaurants pizza is average and offers little in variety they don t do a traditional chicago pizza like gino s or giordano s and in fact one of their specialty chicago crusts is just simply the addition of corn meal music is often too loud and the jukebox seems to attract the nine inch nails type of crowd with a pocket full of quarters service is inconsistent and often poor
  so for my first time here i had a good experience order came out fast and good looked great cane sauce hit the spot and was nice and peppery chicken was moist and fries were superb i wish texas toast was a little more buttery soda machines seemed to be running out of syrup soda was kinda watery and tasteless im excited to go back again
  love coming here for lunch and dinner perfect for a lunch hour and good options to choose from and now offer pizza during lunch time absolutely love going here for dinner and the ambiance is so cozy and relaxing also love the fact that they have live music playing in the evenings
  we ve been coming here for 2 years for breakfast and lunch the blueberry muffins are amazing the best i ve ever had for breakfast we always get pancakes the wrangler and a muffin and share between two adults and a toddler for lunch i love the sedona sandwich with potato salad or i get a half sandwich with a salad the potato and cream cheese soup is also yummy they have so many delicious options and the service staff and owners are all great
  i love this place such a fun atmosphere our go to while in town can get a bit pricey but hit it up during happy hour
  i always try to find the best scones wherever i go during my trip in montreal i found this cute little place that is known for the best scones and shortbread i made my reservation for tea time but i should ve just order scones shortbread and tea only anyways the scones and shortbread are really good but it s still not as good compared to my favorite scones with double devon cream at lovejoy s tea room in san francisco though my mission continues
  this is your run of the mill sports bar that caters to the not so blue collar 30something crowd of chandler the ambiance is nice darker big screen tvs everywhere the waitresses are attractive a staple at these types of places and they are friendly and attentive ours was on this very day it s beer week in az this week and they had just hosted a santan event pub crawl today as part of beer week so they were understandably out of santan devil s ale and the place was quite quiet when we arrived at 5pm we got seated at the patio where the have a nice little bocce ball area and it was nice to enjoy the great phx february weather alright so we ordered burgers as we were both in the mood for a sizable piece of beef hopefully topped with bacon and other yummies they did a pretty good job for being a sports bar but not impressive they claim their meat is fresh ground though when that s the case the patty has a different type of form and is less flat and compacted okay maybe they grind it in the am and then stockpile patties for the day that s fine the bacon i ordered the 9 all star cheddar bacon beef was lame thin a bit stale tasting and not crispy the cheese was fine i did like that the meat was char broiled and so it has a good taste to it also the inside wasn t over cooked and the bread they served it on was kinda sweet and giant tasty actually the sides were blaaaah cole slaw was really boring and had literally 3 ingredients white cabbage carrots sugary mayo something i would expect from chili s or denny s well the burger hit the spot but the rest was plain and boring the stella was not as cold as i prefer our staff was very good so far an ok place to visit but a 4 star place is somewhere i will likely go out of my way to visit this didn t make the cut
  tried mr cooks for the first time a couple of days ago their customer service and delivery service was fantastic the food was delicious we ordered the shrimp lo mein sweet and sour chicken as well as their orange chicken and egg rolls all of which were delicious this is my new place for chinese food delivery also found their prices and portion sizes to be just right
  ever had one of those moments where you want to forget that something ever happened i just had one of those it was after eating at cici s in all of my young adult years i ve never found a reason to complain about pizza i ve had cheap pizza and higher end pizza they are what you pay for and generally what you expect cici s was a different case however sure it s a real cheap price for an all you can eat extravaganza but is it really worth it maybe as a kid i wouldn t mind this place heck as a kid anything pizza related sounded good to me combine two awesome foods like mac cheese and pizza that sounds like a childhood fantasy but when actually having that cardboard slice of pizza with macaroni cheese thrown on top was like i dumpster dived for a slice of pizza and found mac cheese residue on top the pizza didn t taste good nor did the mac cheese combine the two and you get an exponential amount of awful sure they have the normal pizza with the traditional toppings thing is they taste similar to pizza that sat out in a drunken dorm room for about a week maybe worse then they also have the crazy combination pizzas like the mac cheese or one with taco bell style toppings thrown on top which make absolutely no sense at all putting such low quality food and combinations made my taste buds weep tears of sadness that night i wouldn t be surprised if half of my taste buds shut down on me in sheer disappointment forever leaving me with the palate of a senior citizen yes the place was all you can eat all i was able to handle was 1 5 slices it was after that i was done and walked out never again i said to myself never again
  this is going to be a long review only because this has been the most upset i have been and disappointed in any food related business in a very long time i ordered our food over the phone plenty of time before closing and our food was ready to be picked up in five minutes 7 35 pm which is a half hour before closing my husband went to pick our order up and brought it back home only to realize after i looked in the bag we were short one burrito after further looking in the order and noticing our burritos were quite flat they messed up one of our burritos which was to be a bean cheese ground beef with tomato guacamole burrito which the lady repeated back to me twice and just to remind you one burrito still short i proceeded to call at 8 02 pm where come to find out was the owner that answered saying he was a different restaurant said they were closed and proceeded to hang up on me infuriated i called back again to hear ringing until finally a girl answers and repeats a different restaurant name and says they re closed i told her i understand that but we didn t get all the food we paid for along with the wrong burrito she then said they were closed and could do nothing for us until the next day so i went in the next day to talk to the manager or owner to get things cleared up which all i was asking for was the burrito to be taken off our card along with the added expenses to making a burrito we never received the best the manager could do was reimburse the burrito and not make up for their mistake on giving the wrong burrito and then they proceeded to tell me i would have to bring in the burrito from the day before to be reimbursed i couldn t believe it not only was our food given to us incorrectly we were charged for food we never received the cook lied about the burrito being correct in the bag the owner hangs up on us without a resolution to the problem they created in the first place along with the manager not making up for their mistakes and still wanting to charge us
  this place is fantastic it has far and away the best sesame chicken i ve ever had the last time i visited madison this was the first place i went after leaving the airport and the last place i visited before flying out
  beautiful restaurant that catches your eye the staff was really nice and knowledgeable the food is pricey but it s located inside of crystals so that s to be expected the beef carpaccio was delicious the oysters were fresh and my mom ordered the sea bass which was perfectly cooked and tasty i told them that it was my mother s birthday and they brought out a cake with a candle for her on the house great surprise great staff great food and overall great experience a must to check out
  are here twice and don t think it s all that good don t understand why so many good review overrated in my opinion i order banh mi burger it wasn t bad the flavor is sweet with a hint of fresh mint and a side of fish sauce which i don t dip kiki burger was good oxtail fries i give it 3 star taste like chili flavor fries can t even tell if there s oxtail meat in it the price is high i m better off at my favorite in n out burger cheap n good
  probably one of my favorite places to go and get a nice burger right across the street from phoenix college and the environment inside is alot of sports memorabilia and other local icons best time to go is around 11 30am before the lunch rush
  probably the worst lunch we have ever had today i ve had several good meals from this place the last few months so i m leaving 2 stars but honestly this was just unacceptable the spicy chicken strips may or may not have actually been chicken whatever they were did not taste good the fries we hard and cold on the outside while still soggy from grease and steam on the inside hard to describe but yucky the sandwich was soggy from steam in the container when i picked it up the soggy bread gave away and the filling landed on the floor so i can t comment on whether the filling tasted good or not the bread was all soggy not just in the bottom overall we ordered lunch for 4 people and now there are four full containers in the trash as we wait for someone else to bring us something worth eating
  everything was good but nothing was wow the chefs relied too much on salt to season the food we also waited a long time to have our orders taken and then the food came at a very uneven pace i ve eaten tapas many many times before so i m familiar with the fact that the dishes come out as they are ready but one of our dishes came out so long after all the others were finished i was certain they had completely forgotten it we had it put in a to go box once it was delivered because by that time we were just ready to go
  best all you can eat menu around this part of town my go to s are the starfish wild fire and the snow white great happy hour deals as well if you re only looking for a snack or small meal the ayce prices are in line with everyone else s and the selection is great
  this is the first time i enjoy thai foods i know thai is very famous with their cuisine but this time is not as my expectation foods aren t fresh and overcooked service is ok i maybe find another spot
  i came here and tried the 5 course set tasting menu and was very pleased for 36 you chose one soup salad one starter one meat dish one veg dish and one dessert the menu had a dizzying array of choices so i requested the waiter to choose for me a set of dishes best representing the restaurant with a request for spicy the first dish was a lentil soup with a clear base and very spicy with coriander a nice taste to set the tone for the meal hearty and warm i requested spicy and they obliged with this dish which was the most spicy of any dish served the entree was garlic shrimp this was a miss for me the sauce combined with the breading on the shrimp ended up being a mushy mess with a strange consistency the shimps themselves were nicely cooked once you got through their soggy exterior the veg and meat dish were served together the meat dish was a very nice lamb vindaloo the lamb was tender and very flavorful the vindaloo curry was excellently spiced and not too greasy i do wish it was a bit more spicy though the veg dish was another lentil based dish with saffron coriander and garlic a nice combo but the taste could use some more pop as a pairing with the lamb vindaloo it was good but on its own i would find it a bit bland the waiter picked an excellent progression of dishes and the tastes went very nicely together the service started as a bit indifferent but warmed up over he meal with my waiter another waiter stood in for the dessert order and we were back to the indifference again the decor of the restaurant is pleasing and would be a pleasant place for a group of friends or a date
  the food here is cheap and decent amount of portions but what they lack is customer service and a genuine one at that i don t know if it s the asian culture but they don t really acknowledge you here after leaving food or refilling the water a smile or a you re welcome would be a start but they don t do that here they almost failed my refill drink test where i was out of water and they didn t refill the water till i complained you guys serve the people with food and service as this area of the business restaurant requires it or don t serve anyone at all
  i ve been dining at this smashburger for over two years now i feel as though the food is no longer as good as it used to be it is hit or miss with the staff as far as friendliness and that goes for management as well the burgers are very small and need seasoning the chicken is very bland with no seasoning as well the breaded chicken always has a burnt taste and is never juicy i am about ready to boycott this restaurant they have very overpriced food for what you get i also don t like the fact that every time i go in there to eat most of the tables are dirty they always ask how your food is when you have a mouth full of food too someone should teach the servers the 101 basics of serving i believe they should lower their prices for what you get the whole like concept of smashed just makes me think of them being cheap the thin burgers and the super smashed chicken are not what we want to pay for i think it s time smashburger did a revamp of their menu
  this is my neighborhood i just worked 10 hours and need pizza fast go to place the other kicker this is the best service you ll ever get at a pizza place eats my pie has done an excellent job taking the pan pizza and giving it a new look there are several suggested pizzas they ll make for you try the spicy butcher for a little kick or my uncle nicky to satisfy your meatball craving or you can just make your own the best part after ordering your pizza will be done before you can return a text it s literally 2 minutes yes 2 minutes yowza they also have a nice selection of local craft brews not a ton but a good offering recommendation sign up for their text marketing list you do this at checkout i receive periodic texts for 2 off a pie
  5 or 6 years ago this place was awesome then they slowly kept going downhill they changed some of their suppliers the bread for instance was some of the best i have had now it s low end they removed some of their homemade meats the salami was great and they messed with their portions so now i don t even bother going there it s not that it is bad it is still a decent place it s that i remember how good it used to be
  the new proprietors of the kitchen have successfully created the best burger that i have ever tasted the burgers consist of different hand ground cuts of hormone free free range beef the french fries are double blanched double fried guaranteeing a crisp yummy fry the onion rings are cut to order the tempura batter light and the homemade dipping sauce perfect stop in and ask for james one of the new owners and the chef
  i have been to the good egg most usually the one in hilton village which has always been very good and is unrelated to this review over 200 times the past six years and the experience here today was abyssmal my order was screwed up ten minutes later it was screwed up again a totally unacceptable excuse on a signature item a breakfast sandwich where one egg was used instead of two and cooked wrong bacon was forgotten first time cheese forgotten second time and both times it was served on thick bread that was as dry as the desert usually some butter or something is on a breakfast sandwich unless you ask for it dry the manager thought he was being nice for only charging me 2 59 for the cup of coffee i didn t finish i guess i should be thankful i didn t get charged for the two flops that were served i ll go back to my original good egg location but if i get another experience like this at that location good egg will be good riddance for me there are too many other options around here including snooze am opening a mile away in kierland on 8 26 15
  used to frequent this place when i lived in arizona fast delivery and even better sandwiches love the beach club
  6 of us came here for dinner and it was ok no one had any dish that really stood out though we had everything from veal to eggplant to spaghetti and meatballs and nothing was like wow everything was fine ok service was good drinks were ok too i don t know if i d come back or not there are other places i want to check out but it s close to where i live and it s part of downtown summerlin so i just might
  been bookmarked to try for ages we happened to be driving by around 6pm and realized it might be early enough to snag a table without much of a wait no such luck a one hour estimate sent us back to the car for a power nap when we returned however we found our name crossed off and that of many others alas the line had moved a lot faster than their estimate ended up to be only 20 min so be aware even overestimates happen along with the overwhelming menu which they said was basic the walls were wallpapered with handwritten flyers with various specials it wasn t easy to see everything and our table mates had already seemed to figure out the lay of the land and the best of yelp so we followed suit and got a few of their best loved dishes i would have loved to walk around and read everything the grilled squid was great it was served more or less lukewarm temperature sliced width wise but presented whole in a light sauce and grated fresh ginger on the side so tender and the the grilled flavor nicely balanced with the others it was also substantial and filling the agedashi tofu was also great i really liked the mochi with wrapped bacon the bacon was neither overly salty nor fatty nor chewy just a thin non overpowering sheath on the mochi we tried the chicken gizzard yakitori which neither of us liked it was chewy gristly nondescript we also had a sushi with fresh eel on top that i liked the honey toast yeah it s large probably too much for two and seemed about right for the four of us the honey soaked bread underneath the ice cream was the motherlode i d like to try this at home sometime it seems simple but was really good definitely gotta come back and try more stuff quick update almost one year later 12 30 13 i highly recommend reservations above any type of food recommendations here despite the vast experience of the gentleman at the front his estimates are far too unpredictable last year he overestimated by 40 minutes on a one hour wait today he underestimated by 50 minutes on a 30 minute wait however this year we had our baby with us so a major understimation ended up to be a deal breaker which was rough since we had already waited 40 min only to be told that
  we visited in early july 15 and my husband still talks about this place the chef tasting menu with wine pairings is what we both opted for and look back with no regrets hubs says this is his favorite beef filet ever and if we ever go back to vegas he doesn t know if he could do another steak place not sure if the chef tasting menu changes but our waiter gave us great wine pairing recommendations if you have the banana cream pie i would opt for the extra cost wine pairing for that one if you have the carrot cake it so sweet it doesn t need the dessert wine our waiter recommended accordingly but the hubs an i were sharing the desserts so we got to test this out
  came to check out the new location and it wasnt great experience everytime that we wanted to order something more or refill our drinks it took them forever to come to our table and the sauce was kinda different compared to the one on the other location i like the other one better
  strong coffee good wifi lots of seating clean bathrooms local artists work on the walls and super friendly staff not much more you can ask for in a coffee shop
  30 bucks for dinner on a monday evening tons of food over the top they have a little bit of everything my highlights were the meat carving area mmm prime rib was delicious the pre mixed salads were tasty and fresh citrusy chicken orange and nut salad lots of dessert selection i had creme brule and yuumy meringue and you must try the pesto mashed potatoes i think that was one of my favorite things there lowlights the sushi had kind of a dry flilm on top like it had been sitting out way too long and not much selection also i would like them to offer crab legs in more than one spot there was a 5 7 person line at all times for the 1 single tray of crab legs
  i walked in for the first time and had to get the cashiers attention because she was texting on her phone my order veggie low mein cream cheese wontons white rice vegetarian received veggie low mein crab puffs and pork fried rice i asked the cook for what i originally asked for and he said he did what the ticket said then proceeded to show me it i said if i could eat this i would but i m a vegetarian he brought me over a bowl of steamed rice and after separating the pork out of my vegetable low mein it tasted good we left within 5 minutes if receiving my food because the cashier was screaming in chinese on the phone at someone bad idea to go there
  we were very pleasantly surprised the prices are fantastic the food is amazing and you get quite a bit of food they brought samples of other food items they have and were incredibly good to us we have definitely found our new sushi spot we love it here
  i dropped by for lunch i had one of their lunch specials a vegetable tempura bento box it was excellent i wanted to order a roll but i was told that the bento box would suffice there was quite a bit of food i plan on going again i want to try something else
  this place is bomb the flavors are great and i love their hot sauces the calamari taco was delicious the spam kim chee fried rice was super tasty a little on the mushy side i may come back tomorrow before i leave this town for tacos
  loved my experience here my waiter jeff gave us the best service he really knew the menu and gave us excellent advices the bacon cheddar biscuit is excellent bbq pork ribs were tender and great everything we order is total recommended don t miss this place
  love the place and cookies are the best
  the staff is amazing they are super friendly the food is delicious made fresh and the portions are larger than you expect i highly recommend this place try one of their 99 flavors of boba fruit smoothies you will love those stop reading this review and go there and eat
  after two recent visits here i can honestly say i am torn on my review but overall i know i have had better most recently we arrived shortly after 12 and were seated indoors because the patio was full and it took our server over 15 minutes to take our drink order we started off with the spinach artichoke dip and chips which arrived 5 minutes before our food before i get to the food the appetizer was cold and came with about 10 chips being there were four of us we asked for some extra chips and some salsa the chips were warm however the salsa stay away unless you like pace s from the grocery store really are they kidding serving store bought salsa on to the food we ordered a good variety stuffed peppers chicken enchiladas burger and chicken sandwich the chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn the enchiladas and peppers were so spicy we had to ask for more water only positive the fries great seasoning as for the service i wish i took her name but our waitress could have given two sh about being there and you could tell no refills never saw her except our order and bill and very blah not sure we would return anytime soon
  i really enjoy thai food and have visited thailand but don t eat it too often because the thai restaurants near my home are just so so so i was delighted to find this place on a business trip the yellow curry was one of the tastiest i have ever eaten service was quick and efficient and the prices for lunch were excellent they were understanding of how to prepare food completely vegetarian no fish sauce in the curry
  the usual chinese in a casino overpriced okay food the service is definitely better than most i will return though for the spicy vietnamese noodle soups the broth was delicious two choices either oxtail and tendon more fatty and gelatinous or beef they say filet on menu but it is standard pho beef appetizer sampler is a total ripoff i could buy the same from the local asian market and heat up in a microwave for the same results
  as i drove by caffe mona looking for a parking spot good luck parking is on the street only i seriously considered turning around and canceling my brunch plans wow this place is a little frightening from the outside however when i was able to find a spot at a nearby meter i cautious walked in and took a huge sigh of relief the inside is quaint but charming a few tables inside and looks like a deck with tables outside in nice weather although i was drawn to caffe mona because of the prix fixed menu i decided that i really wanted to try the elvis crepes with peanut butter bananas bacon and i thought that a third course of a sweet crepes might be a little much in addition to my elvis i ordered a fruit plate for an app i was rather disappointed in the fruit plate i understand that most fruits are not in season in late march but i was expecting a little more than just apples bananas and white grapes it was not pleasing to the eye also to note my plate was significantly larger than my two dinning companions who ordered the fruit plate as their first course with the prix fixed menu a few minutes later i was presented with the glory that was the elvis i can still taste the sweetness of the syrup and bananas perfectly complimented by the saltiness of the crisp bacon i sat back and enjoyed every last bite while the girls were presented with their third course a crepe with strawbery jam in conclusion don t judge a book by its cover although caffe mona looks rough and tumble from the outside the food atmosphere and decor are well worth the fight to find parking
  point brugge is my absolute favorite place in pittsburgh it s now been a while since i was last there but i know that we got a burger the mac and cheese and the tofu appetizer at the very least re the tofu don t judge we re from california and in my california opinion it was damn good for that matter everything was damn good this place has great ambiance and is the perfect size too i had a fabulous cocktail and the service was friendly attentive and informed overall the food is superb cocktails are amazing and ambiance is comfortable and genuine one caveat be prepared to wait but do wait it s well worth it
  went here a year ago and had an amazing time with great good but this time around i was disappointed i didnt even finish my meal drinks are moderately priced and so is the food the waiter took 45 minutes to even approach the table and when she did she brought us chips and salsa tasted like tomato sauce and then she returned 20 minutes later to order food came out cold and bland never again
  been eating here since we arrived in vegas back in 2001 very consistant quality although we have gone thru about 5 chefs jay remains in charge and the creator of thier menu some of those chefs now work at sumo 2 the 26 ayce menu has all of our favorites and is a great value and they dont really keep track of time it has also allowed us to try many different things we normally wouldn t sonny is ichiban and told us last night that next month they will be offering aycd draft sapporo for 15 plus they have the traditional frequent eater cards at 5 return and now frequent ayce cards that gives free meal after ten meals the chefs don t mind custom orders the food is always fresh they are proud to serve stuff you don t order to let you try once they see what you like they like thier tips in beer if you too are drinking sumo sushi forever
  the name s a little misleading if you go there long enough yes everyone will know your name and it is definitely a bar but try as i might i can t really figure out why cheers insists on keeping grill in its name unless it s referencing the now defunct window that used to serve up mexican fare from the roberto s next door the new smoking laws have now rendered it necessary to actually leave the bar and walk next door pain in the butt regardless cheers is a good low key place to catch up with some friends have some big cheap beers and shoot a few racks of pool on one of the 5 or so fairly well maintained tables that are available the crowd is pretty evenly split between twenty and thirty somethings and older video poker playing denizens the tvs behind the bar show a satisfying mixture of sports reality tv and random movies the ambiance is lacking so bring your own with you in the form of a few good stories and a few raucous laughs don t miss the pin the penis on steve o game or the galaga arcade game in the corner near the entrance
  the bartender is amazingly friendly the place has a great vibe truly the coolest bar ive ever seen it is all leather they serve cucumber water that is on point and the presentation of the jack specialty sliders is only as amazing as the taste of them best bacon ive ever had visiting arizona and so impressed definitely recommend it to anyone looking for good food and a good drink
  amazing hand crafted drinks i didn t get a chance to eat anything but i will be returning i would have given five stars but i came with a large group and it seemed to annoy the bartenders or at least the male bartender that night either way i ll give them another try
  come back inn is a great place to play volleyball during the summer the boot specials are large and a lot of fun with a group live music at night makes it a fun atmosphere and service is pretty decent different story on a sunday afternoon the beer was lukewarm and the service was slow we hear the brunch is good and are willing to go back to try it based on the popcorn being decent seems like a better place to visit at busy times when the service is ready for you very cool atmosphere inside fun decorations and very clean both during busy times and slower times decent bar overall in downtown madison
  everything a sushi place should have it s delicious we ve been looking for a new go to sushi bar and we found it the whole menu is very reasonably priced as well in general mingfu is a great place to go when craving sushi
  i have two small children one which happens to be in his terrible threes he saw a episode of umi zoomi that was all about meatballs which of course meant i had to find a place to get him some for dinner it had been quite sometime since i had gone to olive garden generally the food leaves something to be desired but more so is back in the bay area the service was terrible this location totally changed my mind i will be back often our server crystal was friendly helpful and spot on not only did she make sure our glasses were filled but she always provided a smile however the best part of the evening was when my son dropped one of his meatballs she made sure to send two new ones over to our table free of charge she saw it happened and took action she didn t take time to even ask if we wanted more because she cared enough to recall the whole reason we were even there was for meatballs often i get terrible service these days especially with my kids but this was one time a restaurant chain won me as a customer
  i ve had better thai food but curry was very tasty had the red bean curry red flag when we were served generic green tea bag in diner style mugs charged 2 for a 6oz mug of hit water green tea should be served in a tea pot cups not mugs prefer the other thai place 2 blocks away more authentic
  absolutely loved this place we were there on our way back to fresno very friendly and family oriented place food great home made fresh and affordable would def visit them again ordered customized omelet and much more tasty food thanks
  love this place the salmon salad is superb they have gluten free menu great wine great variety of foods that are all delicious desserts are worth saving room for they also have a frequent buyer app which is awesome 10 off after first visit discounts after every few meals highly recommended
  my husband and i have been going to bluefin since they first opened amazing food best sushi in town by far jin and yura owners have become such great friends of ours everything is exceptional but if you ask jin to just surprise you you are in for a treat i can t say enough about this place
  service is hectic and slow at lunchtime and there is limited seating also the order takers are under trained and inconsistent they are supposed to ask your name when ordering and i ve experienced several instances when they forgot which made it hard to find me and get me my food food is good overall but at lunch i would settle for the prepackaged to go items
  great place always stop in when i am in town they have a wood oven and cook most everything in it i love the italian beef on skewers with vegetables that they do in the oven pizza and deserts are great salads are very good and a meal in themselves one desert and i have never had it is huge and obscene but looks great it is also done in the wood oven excellent italian wine list i don t know the deal with the prior owners but the italian guy i meet who i believe owns the place now is very nice big soccer fan waite staff is very friendly
  went on friday night seemed like much faster seating than nearby cheesecake factory had the ny strip and grilled shrimp 22 with the crab and artichoke dip app 9 the app came promptly with crustini bread it had chunks of blue crab on the top and a cream cheese base we ended up boxing most of it due to our entrees arriving so fast the steak was thin and juicy mashed potatoes as a bed can never be bad green beans were also flavorful a1 added to make everything go down easy grilled shrimp were a bit plain i believe there were 5 of them on a double skewer our server was very attentive and the all important iced tea remained mostly full
  host was really cool we were seated right away service was a letdown 20 minutes of sitting and no hello i m such and such can i get you a something to drink it s hard cause when you re 15 minutes into waiting you get that awkward are we gonna get service at all moment at the 20 minute mark we got up i went straight to the host and told her we were sitting for 20 minutes not a glass of water no hi or hellos and i m sorry but we are leaving i was really excited to eat there too cause their menu was really enticing we tried to go last night but their kitchen was already closed today it was well open and they even had a dj playing good tunes in their stunning harvest industrial dining area setting i m sorry the employees truly dropped the ball on this one when people come and sit in a restaurant usually they re ready to eat and more than likely really hangry if a patron didn t get to experience your cuisine how will they be able to rate the experience sorry i ll never be back i took my money down the street at that tavern that was named after the street it s on where we were seated greeted ordered our drinks then food came afterwards all in that order
  my husband two kids 2 13 and i went for dinner on a friday about 5 there was only one other table of people it was fine though because they had music playing so it helped with it not being too quiet the service was great the food was excellent our server said that live music and dancing starts at 9 30 my husband and i decided to take the kids home and go back for a date night we sat at the bar from 8 45 11 00 we had a nice time but no live music or dancing happened at least not while we were there a lot of sound checks but that s it
  this review is for their to go counter i wish they had 2 cashier locations it s quite a cluster fuck when everyone is trying to check out at one cashier location people waiting in the line for pastries sandwiches gelato and more people wanting to just buy cookies chocolate boxes 2 things to get chocolate covered rice krispies perfect combo of crispy from the rice kris pies chewy and sweet from the marshmallows and bitter from the dark chocolate now only if they added some fleur de sel to balance all the flavors payard and i should collaborate almond chocolate croissant sliced almonds on the outside with an almondy paste topping filled with dark chocolate on the inside i wish they could toast the croissant a bit there s also a small cafe in case you d like to sit down for a hot breakfast there s also small tables outside the shop to enjoy your pastry and gelato i do feel that jean phillipe patisserie in aria has a more enticing sweets selection pistachio strawberry chocolate rice krispy balls
  what great food had been wanting to visit this restaurant and i was not disappointed food was awesome and service was top notch my daughter was given some candy and a toy to play with nice personal touch
  have been coming here for years and they are always spot on service is always fast and the food is consistent they run these daily lunch specials for around 6 50 8 00 and that includes your tea try the baked chicken on thursdays or my favorite is the blackened fish on fridays they do a pretty good happy hour as well
  waffles cafe would fall somewhere between a 3 4 star rating depending on how much you like waffles i on the other hand love waffles and the idea of a waffle breakfast sandwich sold me a perfect waffle should be soft on the inside and slighty crispy on the outside wc executed this quite well and i was impressed waffle breakfast sandwich comes with eggs bacon ham and a secret sauce i was quite skeptical about the secret sauce a little hard to described but it was lightly sweet and creamy at the same time everything went well together and the portion here was reasonable for 5 99 pay an extra 50cent and you will get a soda and chips with your breakfast sandwich special the only thing i would change about the breakfast sandwich here was the bacon i wish the bacon was a little crispier and more well done http www flickr com photos 52387693 n08 4875590875 4 5 stars my girlfriend ordered the waffle combo w an egg and bacon on the side the waffle itself wasn t expensive but adding her following toppings nutella strawberries banana and whip cream made things a little pricier http www flickr com photos 52387693 n08 4875590609 4 5 stars
  i really like silky s it s a great little bar with a good two list last time i was there the southern tier 2xipa was on so good i had the reuben and was so happy with it crispy buttery bread with corned beef and sauerkraut the fries on the side were crispy and soft in the middle i ll be back
  objectively speaking this restaurant is positioned right in the median line among korean restaurants however i ve lived in both la and sf for several years each so i could be a harsh critique here this is the only korean restaurant in tempe aside from the one offs like paradise hawaiian bbq and so you re not exactly picking from a bunch anyway the food tends to be well portioned though many of the dishes had been pre cooked and are just heated to order i e yukkaejang my biggest discontent is the price which is quite expensive comparing against the price level of other korean restaurants i ve been to and absurdly expensive when compared against the other restaurants of similar caliber in arizona the best thing happening here is the pancake so definitely try it out if you re new to korean food it s about 13 maybe even 15 and serves as a great appetizer to split between 3 4 people don t go for the happy hour stuff they are puny in portion the second best thing happening here is the service though it depends on who you get the younger servers tend to be really friendly well spoken and willing to take your fight to the kitchen for you for example my yukgaejang spicy noodle soup showed up with no noodles the girl server had the kitchen serve me a whole side bowl of noodles and soup for free the older servers by contrast tend to be hags
  we were in town for the ces convention and ate at a number of great and not so great places this was our first visit to table 10 and it was a wonderful experience the wait staff was perfect not distant not hanging around too much the food from corn chowder soup to scallops to pork tenderloin were all wonderfully seasoned and just plain good our 4 person party all had different things and sharing was the order of the day including the mac and cheese we had a nice wine and the dinner was just great i have eaten at nola in new orleans and it has the same feel to it if i had to say one thing bad about the place was how often when making a reservation the host told me about the dress code smart casual attire whatever that is i wore business casual and it seem to fit in ok i didn t feel under dressed all in all a great experience
  here s what we ordered for 2 people ahi tuna appetizer caesar salad salumi platter imported imberico ham lamb chops pork sausage pasta filet mignon seafood pasta and mattonella al ciccolato my absolute favorites were the salumi platter lamb chops seafood pasta and the mattonella al ciccolato my rule of thumb is not to order steak at an italian restaurant but the bf loves filet mignon i do too but not at a non steakhouse i have to attempt to cook lamb i have fallen in love with the lamb the ahi tuna appetizer tasted ok but since i live in hawaii i have had much fresher ahi 3 stars caesar salad it s not the typical caesar salad in terms of presentation it s one romaine lettuce cut in fourths with caesar dressing and fresh anchovies i love anchovies but my bf doesn t so we asked for anchovies on the side that was the best part of the salad to me 3 stars salumi platter prosciutto salami and porchetta i loved the prosciutto and salami the porchetta tasted like eating asian rice paper that comes on japanese candies 4 stars imported imberico ham tasty but i wouldn t say it s the world s best ham in the world definitely wasn t worth the 40 3 stars lamb chops i absolutely loved this dish dare i say it wait for it wait for it 4 5 stars pork sausage pasta pork sausage was a tad bit overwhelming fennel but it was palatable sorry for the graphic description but the pasta that it comes with umm how shall i put it looks exactly like maggots 3 stars filet mignon not a fan was overdone even though we asked for medium rare it came out almost well done 2 5 stars seafood pasta loved it i have never been to italy and never claimed to be an expert in authentic italian cooking i just know what i like first and foremost the pasta must must must be al dente otherwise i will return it the seafood pasta was delicious shrimps make me happy 4 5 stars and finally drumroll please dessert mattonella al ciccolato i love dark chocolate absolutely divine dessert dark chocolate ganache cake paired with chocolate gelato with crispy bits of hazelnut is to die for warning if you are not a fan of dark chocolate like the bf don t order this dessert for me i was in heaven foodgasm need i say more 5 stars last but not least i got to see chad glad he is doing well 5 stars we got a take out of two order of lamb chops one order of seafood pasta and one order of filet mignon the total was 372 50 thank you very much bellagio
  smoker friendly terrific italian menu good food good service nice decor sports on 4 televisions excellent value
  really large portions but the food is just average the fried chicken was not especially seasoned and it was mostly dry breast the waffles are stuffed with bacon but better in theory than in taste
  excellent flavors very authentic fun to try all the salsas atmosphere is dated and worn but the reports of the bad neighborhood are over stated would have like real silverware meats are tender rich complex tastes we will be back
  food the crab cakes were delicious the crawfish was fresh the catfish was well seasoned they have certain days where crawfish and crab are offered at a discounted price service very friendly relaxed ambience feels like a family owned restaurant
  pizza was much better than i remembered crust came out quite well with just enough crispness and golden color cheese was flavorful and diced tomatoes were sweet and delicious side of sauce is necessary here because it is so good don t forget to try the calzones i had a small hiccup with service but otherwise this was a great dining experience and the food is consistently good
  so firstly when you enter this place for happy hour its difficult to believe you are in phoenix it seems more like la its crowded people are hip there is energy in the place and the food is great went with a friend for happy hour so now while i was not too happy with my cocktail mango mai tai i loved the food we ordered the caterpillar roll the salmon roll and shrimp tempura the crab puffs werent too great but the stuffed shrimp was awesome and very filling the service was excellent even though it was really crowded and the ambience is lovely the music was great however its not difficult to have a conversation with your friends as its not so noisy would definitely recommend they dont take reservations for happy hour so get there early if you are in a big group
  the johnson ranch location sucks pizza is bad and delivery for one ordinary pizza took over an hour and a half
  today my husband and i went to brunch at st francis for the first time the food was fabulous the service fantastic with greg and kaitlyn and of course the wonderful jazz music can t wait to return
  toasted ravioli excellent filet mignon best i ve ever had ribs best i ve ever had french dip best i ve ever had love this place
  we went here for the first time last week tinino and the other staff members could not be more accommodating and fabulous they were all so helpful in suggestions we usually pick what we like and rarely try anything new but tinino not sure i am spelling it correctly suggested various dishes including the lemoncello sorbet yum the atmosphere is light and classically casual with a great vibe wonderful wine pricing and meals are substantial to share if you haven t gone here what are you waiting for i cannot wait to go back when i can sit outside thanks for the great food
  good prices for well crafted drinks in a nice setting haven t tried their food but it did look good the place is in a strip mall with not much else around and might be far for the central phoenician they were probably understaffed but the server was very sincere and apologetic i d be back if in the area
  i now love ramen this was my first time i had the basic one with extra pork do not fear the cheek it s fattier but not scary to eat at all just absolutely amazing if you show up for bachi burger they share the restaurant skip those overrated burgers do yourself a favor and get some ramen
  with 808 hawaiian mixed plate not too far away this place just doesn t cut it for me i ordered the garlic chicken no garlic just sweet and sour chicken very misleading description coworker orders portuguese sausage eggs rice what can go wrong right um the box opens and i ask did you order corn beef hash it is some strange dried spam patty looking thing no bueno they should probably just call this place china barbecue because there isn t anything hawaiian that i can spot we also tried the ahi tuna poke i will give them credit for having fresh fish even if the marinade wasn t amazing
  great meal and great service
  update from jason about dim sum equipment are not arriving in time for full dim sum menu joe wants to make sure all dim sum items are available for you to enjoy so dim sum menu will be delayed soonest might be next saturday if all equipment shows up as promised jason sends his apology for the delay good things fine to those who wait
  food is okay but it s pricy compare to what they have
  wow it s my first time here it s turnt up and ratchet hahaha it s a pretty freakin big venue we got drunk and had fun besides that i don t have much to say about it
  angel was our server he was extraordinary in his knowledge and hospitality skills we used a restaurant com voucher with no hassles everything was perfect
  delicious great food for a great price the lemon chicken is awesome and so is their lo mein great fried rice and eggrolls the portions are big and the staff is fast and friendly one of my favorite places
  the food was amazing we had prime rib with baked potato i had macaroni and cheese as a side i have never had it taste like this i think thst it could be the blend of cheese my husband suprised me with an over nighr get away for our anniversary
  i don t know why this place has such bad reviews but i ve been here twice and loved the experience i was prompted to my seat and my order and drinks were here on a timely matter my food was well cooked and my server even threw some fries for free i had the cheeseburger babies and it tasted amazing maybe some people have waaaay too high of expectations when it comes to a cheeseburger fries and a drink
  we made a reservation for two for the all you can eat sushi i thought it would be a pretty good or at least decent place to dine since it was inside the paris casino boy were we wrong this is the worst sushi place i have ever eaten we were allowed to choose three rolls each from the menu i ordered one plate with the three rolls and ate less than one roll from that plate i was too scared to eat more and get sick it was the shortest dinner i have ever had i would not reccomend anyone to come even if you are hungry you re better off not eating because you will definitly leave this place with an empty stomach
  wow what difference used to be a loyal of the hooters hotel resturant well this location is beyond superior than the hotel the food is amazing cheaper and portions are a lot bigger the waitresses are great always friendly warm and welcoming they always have a smile and fast service i will be returning only to this location from now on way to win my business hooters
  sooooo disappointing it had so much promise i ordered a greek salad with dressing on the side for takeout on my lunch break i go the salad it had beets on it but they were covered up with the feta cheese like really beets i double checked the take out menu i got to see if beets were there nope no beets i m not a beet fan and my cucumbers were mushy and old f booo
  only three stars because i think the prices are a tad high the mahi mahi taco i had and shared a picture of was tasty iwould order this again and recommend it too but the price seems kinda high for just one taco the salmon taco another pic was loaded tasted fishy which is not ideal son had a burrito and since he was opposed to dining here he is not giving it a fair review he said it was food paying almost 4 00 for a single taco wouldn t you think they would give you chips nope gotta charge for those too we rarely come here simply because there are so many other mexican food options within a couple miles proximity to us
  waitress was great although everyone seemed overwhelmed maybe bc it s fairly new to open the guacamole was excellent other than that everything we ordered was completely over salted our family of 6 couldn t finish anything they ordered bc of all the salt even the chicken and rice soup wouldn t return thankfully we had a gift card so we only had to pay 80 dollars for food no one ate
  when i go to bed at night and dream it s not about brad or johnny pitt and depp it s vic anthony yes as the rating indicates it is as good as it gets this is the perfect description of a dining experience vic anthony s will always be my first and only choice for upscale dining downtown in las vegas no wait scratch that i only visit vegas to dine here steakhouse cuisine is unparalleled in its simplicity succulent porterhouse dripping in natural juices and butter either way steak proves that the simplest foods can constitute great dinners they know how to carry out fully here we are fully convinced that this is the best of the best of the best in fact whenever our dearest friends family or clients are visiting the vegas area we call vic and anthony s and run a comp charge via our credit card and treat them to the experience of there lifetime let s just say we are pretty popular after this 0
  the all you can eat lunch is a great deal and the food was bomb some of my co patrons in my party were not impressed when we first entered but were believers once they tasted the food got two men to admit they were wrong that s how good this place is
  tried the pork tenderloin thinking its might be a healthier alternative with spinach tomato not a chance pork tenderloin was breaded and laying on a huge mound of potatoes huge portions 27 00 should be a meal for two sorry that i missed sushi happy hour at flamingo as is my stomach
  i just learned that our favorite ice cream parlor is closing this weekend i m extremely sad and disappointed to see this happen my children love stopping in every tuesday and thursday to get a treat plus karen s kreamery is a rare business in the west valley it s one of the only places that reminds me of my own childhood neighborhood corner store where i bought ice cream candy and chips i m going really miss having karen s kreamery
  this place looked so nice however the service and food sucked we ordered crab cake and miso ramen with a rose drink the only good thing about this place is that it looked nice and the crab cake we waited for 45 minutes for our damn food to get out it took forever we didn t even enjoy our damn ramen cause we lost our appetite waiting so damn long the bill was about 88 fucking dollars the ramen didn t even taste like ramen there was no damn flavor at all the 99cent ramen packets taste way better than this crap also there was a table in front of us who came after us and they got their food within 15 minutes what the hell is this crap i would not suggest this place at all the food court tastes and has better service than this crappy place
  i m a fan we eat here often the menu has a lot to offer and their food is very good love the soups love the sandwiches love the butternut squash ravioli the sauce is killer the have great cookies and pastries as well the staff are always nice and the place is always clean well worth trying if you haven t been there hatch
  i enjoyed my lunch experience i tried a thai noodle dish similar to pad thai except the noodles are wider i really liked the sauce in the dish it was listed as being a spicy dish most traditional thai food when listed as spicy is hot this dish wasn t the prices are average my husband ordered pho which had a good flavor but the accompanying basil bean sprouts could have been better overall the experience is nice and i particularly enjoy thai dishes while he enjoys pho so it was nice that we could dine in one place and both order our preferences
  this isn t a place you go for great cuisine it s a place for a celebration or a family dinner or going with friends it s more of an experience at least in my opinion and yes t is pricey i was there with friends and we had a great time we had a window table with a nice view we got beers the shrimp cocktail pork ribs bone in ribeye and swordfish definitely skip the swordfish the entrees come with lots of sides like bread beans so flavorful and salad they bring you cotton candy at the end i wouldn t go back here but it was fun to try once saving money protip i m not sure if they let you split a meal but if so order a meal and add a baked potato only like 2 more there is plenty of freaking food for two people with all the sides they bring out
  this place is really good tastes are great and service is nice got spicy basil and drunken noodle and both are great really recommend this place
  fantastic breakfast and very good service the cafe is also very clean can t wait to come back and try something new
  some of the freshest best tasting sushi i ve had here my husband got an inside tip from a co worker that knows that the owner purchases the fish the day it s flown in so it was worth the drive to try it out now that we ve made the trip know that the quality of the fish they serve is top notch we will not hesitate to go back wish it was just a tad bit closer to home but that s my i don t want to get in my car drive any further than i have to when it s 110 degrees side coming out i will suck it up though make the drive b c it s that good we ve been twice now both times we have loved everything we ve tried i should preface this by saying that i am not a huge fan of all the fancy rolls that have become so popular over the last decade or so i m an old school sushi eater i like the simplicity of sashimi nigiri i like to taste the fish when it s all wrapped up in a roll covered in sauces tempura crunch it can be very hard to tell if you re even getting a fresh piece of fish that worries me a bit the 1st time we went i had a hankering for salmon terriyaki was not really in the mood for sushi maybe only the 2nd time in my life that has ever happened i did order the poki appetizer it was ah mazing the salmon terriyaki was good although the sauce was way too thick there was too much of it covering the fish if i order it again i will definitely ask them to go easy on the sauce hubby ordered the ayce from what i could tell he enjoyed every roll he had this last time we both had the ayce i will probably only do that from now on it s a great value even if you don t eat very much you can choose from hot cold appetizers as well as all the sushi choices i ordered the poki again along with some nigiri orders even a couple of the fancy rolls mainly b c i already knew that their fish was fresh i liked the angry ninja the sushi twister roll the best i think i could eat that japanese salsa all by itself yum i was slightly disappointed that they don t have fresh wasabi most of the better sushi restaurants i ve been to have it available for an extra charge so i was surprised they didn t have it i have developed quite the affinity for it can t really eat the stuff made from a powder anymore i hope they consider making it available in the future would be happy to pay an extra dollar or 2 to have some for my sushi we will be bringing the kids next time sushi gets very expensive when we go out as a family but the ayce deal will make it much more reasonable they will be thrilled anything we want
  yumma yumma yummy i was at the biltmore and craving a hamburger for lunch i decided to stop in at zinburger the place was packed however i found a spot at the bar and within 15 minutes the bartender took my order and my burger was right in front of me i ordered the zinburger the burger was cooked to perfection i will definitely be back and i will bring others to enjoy zinburger s wonderful burgers
  i teetered between 1 and 2 stars i m not sure what turned me off more the guy the cook the owner one in the same who greeted me at the door in a white tee shirt and sprouting chest hair ala simon cowell but decidedly not the pec proud idol judge the wobbly chair i was worried might break at any second or the fact that it took more than 10 minutes to receive our drinks not a good start to say the least the pizza my friend ordered the greek was cold and uninspired and my calzone s crust was equally cold and bland absolutely no flavor to the crust that supposedly cooks in a wood fired oven no burn marks no crispness nothing even approaching my favorite calzone from cibo or bianco in downtown phoenix unfortunately the prices were as high as those other establishments which seals the coffin on this place for me put it in the ground and bury it
  mastro s was recommended by a co worker who went to one of the locations in ca and absolutely loved it i made reservations for a group of friends and i and despite some initial resistance from my fellow yelper lauren m we all had a fabulous time and were more than happy with our decision to come here our server lionel was amazing the whole evening he was friendly helpful and attentive he recommended we get a customized seafood tower and everyone in the group was very impressed we were also impressed with our meals i got the bone in filet and two of my friends split the tomahawk special my other friends got fish my filet melted in my mouth and was cooked perfectly i don t typically get filet when i go to a steakhouse but i was so happy with my meal we also got the very popular lobster mashed potatoes for a side and it was delicious lionel brought us out some of the warm butter cake for dessert and it was amazing you could definitely smell the butter as soon as he put it down on the table you must try it if you come to mastro s the setting is a little weird as you are essentially in the middle of a mall honestly the food was so good that i could have been sitting literally anywhere and enjoyed this meal
  do you ever tell yourself you are going to try something new and then you order the same thing you always get again at sacks my art of sandwicherie is the symphony turkey avocado bacon sprouts on 12 grain bread that is nothing short of deliciousness yum forget about the cookies and the chips or the fact that i absolutely love their lemonade and focus here people the sandwich is divine there is a great place in salt lake city called skool lunch i used to eat there all the time when i worked downtown and with all of the fabulous delis in the phoenix metro area i haven t found anything that got it just right until now recommended by a friend who did her undergrad at asu i stopped in to give it a try nothing fancy and the service is average but the sandwich was nothing short of incredible they have lots of great choices but i know myself know myself well i ll pretend like i m going to get something else but when it comes down to it um uh yeah we know what i m going to do i ll be in tempe again next week see you then
  closest to los angeles mexican i have found in the mid west madison before the discovery of this gem the closest i found was taqueria guadalajara on park street the trio de tacos are my constant go to s it s exactly what it s called a trio of tacos pastor pork chicken and carne asada steak tacos the pork taco is my fave the flavors are exactly the taste of home no cheese or extra stuff in it just good meat and cilantro and onions meat is cooked right sauces are flavorful and authentic the prices are cheap the tortilla chips are really authentic and delicious service is excellent everyone s friendly acommodating give it a try and see what your face dish is because other dishes like the enchiladas quesadillas and mole are all good
  grubbed here for the first time just a couple days ago lodged in a strip mall and distinguished by red claw like font bangkok seemed like a decent place to fill the tums a little reluctant to enter the blinds were open just a tad giving us a peek in at 7 45pm no patrons at all you might have assumed they were about to close assumption false though when we tried the door and slipped right in we were greeted by two nice guys who happily allowed us to choose any of the 30 30 vacant tables thanks the menu included all the common offerings found in most thai places here so i guess we played it safe by ordering the combo appetizer combo seafood soup pad thai and thai bbq yes a lot of food the guy did not hesitate to remind us to save space in your stomach thanks again guy combo appetizer was alright and by alright i mean their fishcakes were out of supply and had to be replaced by chicken satay which was not so succulent but whatever other members of the combo appetizer were eggrolls with very crispy wrapper but minimal filling crab puffs and fried tofu all pretty ok appets accompanied by the usual sauces pad thai was underwhelming and add to that anemic bbq was bbq the only somewhat tasty thing was the combination seafood soup tom yum goong base with fishes of the sea sparse distribution of shrimp and rough cuttlefish coconut ice cream did not hint any coconut but rather shaved ice with coconut flavor these eats for roughly 80 really 80 yeah that s what i keep asking myself most likely will not return
  was in las vegas this past week in the 100 degree weather i ve had authentic shave ice in oahu before and i tell ya not one of them even came close to da onolicious kine shave ice that we had at snow ono s shave ice my wife and i had da melona p o g shave ice which was suggested by owner jon and boy was it ono ono i highly recommend and suggest who comes out to the desert of las vegas to make it a point to find the snow ono s mobile truck and have a taste of da islands in da hot lands we loved it mahalo nui loa jon and marianne cheee huuuuu d here is their website folks http snowonoshaveice com da schedule
  great lunch place fresh well seasoned food has more than sushi kimichi pork was tasty
  08 29 13 had the avocado smashburger no complaints here burger came out hot and juicy with lots of fresh avocado and flavorful bacon fries were thin and crispy and the order was generous i thought prices were reasonable this is a welcome and much needed addition to the choices available in the queen creek san tan valley area friendly and attentive service too i will definitely come back
  love this place casual and really kid friendly fresh cut fries lemon oregano are rockin great quality ingredients no skimping the staff is friendly and helpful the owner is usually there and always has a smile on his face i love their salads and the kids really dig the chicken kabobs we tried another greek place near earth fare in south charlotte it did not come close to greco we keep coming back for the great food and the everyone s friendly attitude solid casual and soooo good
  this is a nice new chicken tender place that s what cain s should be they offer much more than just tenders alone and more sauce choices which is great i had the buffalo chicken sandwich and frys i ve got to say the sandwich is comparable to the mcd s spicy mcchicken sandwich and sadly i thought the mcd version is better and only a buck the frys are a little limp i like crispy frys the wife had the crispy turkey sandwich with was very good crispy and great flavor i ll get that next time
  please do not write reviews of a restaurant if you have never been to the establishment this was a great place to eat everything was outstanding the wait staff was great and the food was wonderful i asked if i could take the sumac which was on the table with me after dinner a compulsory baklava and persian tea just can not be turned down
  i haven t been to this restaurant since i was a kid food was exactly how good it was back then probably better same delicious bread with oil and vinegar to start off we ordered the mac n cheese bites and spicy meatballs for appetizer for 9 50 pick 2 deal cheese bites were outstanding for my entree i had chicken parmigiana and my brother had lasagne both were excellent i enjoy a simple spaghetti sauce and the one on the chicken parm hit the spot great dinner and can t wait to go back
  hidden gem off the strip this place is always part of our las vegas itinerary the meat is sooooo good it s cooked to perfection the portions are huge yams are delicious the place looks a bit shady outside and the bathrooms are eh but it s not worth taking away stars the food will speak for itself
  this is a great place to go for specialty items i went here looking for unfilled canolli shells there they were right in front as i walked in i loved that i really don t like to ask where things are so it was a bonus i wandered the aisles a bit and listened to the conversation around the place a woman was talking about being a transplant from chicago and the proprietor told her all about some of the products they sold that were specific from that area i liked the atmosphere i liked the variety of products sold especially the large selection of drinks and things like that pretty cool my only difficulty was getting out of the parking lot blah i hate traffic and this place is close to a busy intersection other than that no complaints
  favorite sushi place in montreal if not anywhere try the soleil de maiko enfer cornet paradis pesto sushi trust me it is awesome but everything is good great drink selection too
  what a treat i have never been to any place like the genghis grill i have to admit the name and the outward appearance of this restaurant really made me not want to take that leap of faith but i am glad i did not to mention it s great for everyone vegan lactose intolerant celiac vegetarian friendly woo hoo the first time is sensory overload most people turn their inner poke mon freaks on and turn gotta catch em all on the food but the best advice i can give you is to calm down deep breaths there is a lot to choose from and the staff will walk you through it if you are a first timer also a good clue is to watch the folks around you who look like regulars they know what they are doing you start with a seemingly small bowl but don t worry this is not what you re finish product will be served in there are recipe cards at the beginning of the line and everyone thinks that if you use one of those you are wimping out not true they are there for a reason because they have been perfected i recommend starting with one and adding your own touches as you go along it goes in order protein spices veggies salsas eggs miscellaneous etc at the end you will come to the sauce buffet be warned here as well the first time i went i filled my sauce ramekin to the brim because i thought well the cup is this big so i guess they want me to fill it to the top not the logic here my bowl was swimming in sauce i would fill it a little over half way with whatever dressing you choose next you wrap up the excitement by walking over to the grill and telling them what kind of starch you would like white rice friend rice noodles etc this is also the part where you let them know if you have any allergies and they will cook yours on a separate grill amazing in exchange they will give you a numbered card that you take back to your table while you drool like a st bernard while you wait anxiously and suffer with every waitress waiter that walks by with a red bowl just praying that the next one is yours overall we had a ton of fun here and it gets better every time quick easy cheap what is there not to like
  stopped by fine ash cigars and smelled a wonderful aroma of wood smoked meat it was coming from everybody s neighborhood grill i went in and ordered some takeout got pulled pork beef brisket a rib and fish ala carte for 2 a serving i thought it would be an easy way to check their food out the barbecue sauce was a deep molasses brown sugar cinnamon sauce with just a little heat tasty fish was hand breaded in a great cornbread type breading the restaurant looks clean though a bit small their food is so good they may have to expand at some point
  service was pretty horrible and they weren t busy at all the only person that was actually hustling around were the bussers the waiter came around and took our drink order and didn t ask us if we wanted to order appetizers after getting our drinks we didn t see our waiter for about 20 minutes in total we saw our waiter maybe 4 times during our dinner probably never coming back
  i feel sorry for anybody to think that this is good mediterranean or middle eastern cuisine i am from dearborn michigan the largest middle eastern community america i had middle eastern food and mediterranean food made in people s homes that tastes better than this stuff they sell a diet conscious friend and i was hungry so we decided to go there i ordered the spinach pie thinking it would be good but the spinach pie was deep and full of grease i never had spinach pie deep fried it literally made me sick me to my stomach the guy will meet with like beef shavings wasn t even on authentic shawama bread he didn t even press it to prepare some pieces of the meat had had fat on it i orders a fatoush salada that not hard to make that was fair the cook owner even got a little upset with me when i was questioning him about the preparation of my sandwich i would never visit there again and you don t believe me for yourself try some food here and go to another nearby middle east restaurant that s not too far from them they make real shawarma s and try the food there and see for yourself
  amazing food service can be hit or miss but always friendly drinks pours are average prices are fair for the area i would recommend the place its just not one of my favorites
  we ate here about a year and a half ago and went back tonight and it was really bad no taste to the sauce and lasagna was not like before i guess they got a new cook but we won t be back patty t las vegas nv
  my boyfriend is from el paso and he says it s pretty close to the real thing if you re from el paso and craving chicos this is the place
  when i mention five guys to a group of my friends they just could not stop ranting raving o m ging and everything in between i thought to myself for reals no way let s get down to business i got myself a bacon cheeseburger regular fries and a drink 11 bucks i thought it was pretty pricey especially when i could drive a little bit and grab myself a double double animal style fries and a drink for 6 bucks at in n out the order came out in a paper bag and you could see the grease spots all over it yum i opened the paper bag only to find a mountain of fries just piled inside the burger was what i was most looking forward to i opened the aluminum wrapper like it was a christmas present carefully and slowly to see the steam of the fresh hand packed juicy double bacon cheese burger staring right back at me and begging for mercy as i was about to double fist the burger into my salivating mouth one bite was all it took the endorphins were rushing through my brain and all that i uttered under my breath was o m g the fries though left much to be desired hence the one star deduction it wasn t all that they were cracked up to be it was a bit bland and soggy there is really nothing worse than taking a bite of a juicy burger only to bite into a soggy fry right afterwards it ruins the experience i don t care that much for soggy fries it was truly a let down overall minus 1 for the fries plus 5 for the burger oh and the peanuts you can eat while waiting five guys is going to be a success in vegas i can t wait to see them grow and go back again for their delectable burger
  excellent homemade burgers great portions for the price
  very friendly and curious staff the neapolitan pizza was delicious we did pepperoni and jalapeno peppers as our toppings we were happily surprised with complimentary garlic knots and dessert it was our first time and if we lived here we would go again and again
  how this place has managed to stay open so long is an eternal mystery to me the food has always been mediocre the service was not even that good but somehow it endures guess that explains how dubya got reelected
  went a few weeks ago for dinner before a concert at the ovature center the food was very good and the service was extremely attentive i am tempted to give it 3 stars because i d rather do 3 5 but i think it is an excellent albeit expensive choice for a romantic dinner i don t know if i d go back just because there are so many other great choices downtown but i think it s worth a try if you want a higher end meal with a great view of the capitol
  the food was not that great i had high hopes as some times tomasos food is great and others not so great i would say this is his biggest weakness inconsistency today was not a great day the veal was bland no seasoning and the raw onions was over powering in addition the service was mediocre tomaso and 2 other persons sat at the bar while the waitress scrambled around we won t go back and won t recommend the pizza was ok
  stopped here for a quick bite before seeing jersey boys at the palazzo food was great we had pizza s and chicken parm portions on the chicken were huge everything was done well we had an excellent waiter he was very attentive and fun overall a great place for a quick meal in vegas
  i should have listened to my fellow yelpers but i decided to take a chance anyways and what a mistake it was the hostess was very nice and we were seated right away the waiter came over and right away he had an attitude when i asked him if they had any flavored lemonade or iced tea he told me yes when i asked what flavors they had he told me that they had pink lemonade which has a lemonade flavor and regular iced tea which has an iced tea flavor so obviously he did not understand my question correctly and his answers were very condescending i told him that we needed a few more minutes and to please come back when he came back we still hadn t decided and i could tell that he wasn t happy about having to wait for us instead of being polite and checking back in a few more minutes he decided to have a ten minute conversation with the table next to us completely ignoring us after being talked down to and then ignored we got up to leave and only then the waiter asked if we wanted to order something i told him no that we were going somewhere else that had better service he happily smiled and said o k i have never walked out of a restaurant in my life but i certainly wasn t going to spend my good money to be talked down to and ignored by the waiter this waiter does not in any way reflect the class of mandalay bay and how such a poor service provider can be employed in a hotel of this class i have no idea i will not be recommending this restaurant to any one
  what s there not to love about this place i only wish they were open a little later i have only tried the teriyaki bowls but i m sure everything on the menu is good and prices are fairly reasonable usually a large bowl is shareable with my kiddo momma on a budget love it
  my husband and i have been fans of the sterling brunch for quite a few years so we were looking forward to trying the brunch in the newly remodeled restaurant it did not disappoint it exceeded all expectations we had dinner at the blt steakhouse a few days earlier and it was so wonderful due in part to our server sergio that we requested that he be our server for brunch to tell you how great sergio was i did something i never do i told sergio how much i loved the duck pate and could he find a little jar even though it wasn t on the menu he did this is the kind of service that you don t get every day sergio i hope your boss reads the reviews because you are awesome
  we want one of these in san francisco the food was excellent the service was awesome and the drinks were pretty damn good too we did what many have mentioned doing and had our server create a tasting menu of her favorite dishes she chose for us tuna taco s filet mignon with mushrooms in a savory coconut sauce seabass skewers with peruvian corn yellowtail sashimi with lemongrass spicy tuna and tempura shrimp rolls
  awesome to have vegan and vegetarian options in the far east valley foods are based more on homemade whole foods instead of processed fake meats friendly and knowledgable staff will definitely return
  i stopped in for a coffee at cult espresso and i have to say the following the coffee was superb the carrot cake was excellent and the service was quite nice the gentlemen who were working there knew more about coffee than i could ever know and they tried to help me pick one that they thought i would enjoy they got it right the coffee and cake were perfect however the atmosphere was a bit too hipster for my taste this doesn t mean that i won t be back but i don t know that it would be my first choice either also i couldn t connect to their wifi which meant that i couldn t really get any work done there this may not be the type of coffee shop for that anyway judging by the music selection i heard when i was there another thing to note is that the old chairs and desks look cool but are not all that comfortable to sit in while enjoying coffee or espresso but it does look really cool despite my complaints i m not down on cult espresso i know it caters to a certain crowd of people the fellows working there were nice and their coffee and cake is good but for me i don t think it would be my first choice if i m honest although i have told people about it who i know will love cult espresso maybe i ll be back you never know
  the restaurant is a bit divey but the food is worth it
  great food and atmosphere the cottage pie and fish chips were excellent the service was fantastic will definately be back
  if you want to eat good food good coffee that rival the quality of a 5 star hotel in the strip this is the place to go i ate the corned beef hash and it is good reasonable price good service and friendly staff
  the service was really good they have a huge menu but realistically a lot of it is redundant just different sizes portions of the same meal the food was really good and they do offer a low carb menu if you want a lighter option i love the little country store too
  i was looking forward to eating at the wicked spoon everyone said how good it was they weren t wrong i had the best salmon ever general tsao s chicken i thought would be to hot but it was wonderful the desserts are out of this world i wished i could have stayed all day i will be back and i will tell my friends don t waste your time going to the aria buffet not worth it m hotel has a good buffet if you don t mind driving seniors get 2 for 1 on wednesdays 14 99 for two but if you go on the weekend they get you for 35 00 a person and no discount they threw a few seafood items on there and that s why they are charging 20 00 more not worth it for that price
  the food was ok but we asked a waiter to help one of our friends that had just shown up his comment was do you have a tab at the bar i can t help you and then he walked away our friend had no tab at the bar when we told the manager he said sorry about that our second waiter was really nice though
  a friend of mine who is keen on looking out for my best interests brought up an interesting idea why don t you delete your old reviews and start fresh for the new year and do the same next year it does make sense is a review from 2009 really relevant in 2012 probably not but i do like the idea and will take this into serious consideration and wipe my entire review data base from the cyber world and start fresh but this is a rather daunting task and it will have to wait till after the weekend fish head stew an off the menu item here is one of those that i tried towards the end of 2011 i consider myself an adventurous eater but the thought of fish heads in my belly would require serious amounts of sojou in my system i was not that confident when the concierge suggested we check out ga hyang and we would be amazed and blown away by this place i must admit there is better korean in la but being this is the desert it really isn t bad effort is put into putting together quality dishes but one piece of advice you can tone down on the spice and just let the pork belly speak for itself
  horrible experience im very lenient on my reviews but for me to give this place 1 star it had to be ridiculously awful came on a weeknight around 9 30 after choosing it over waffle house because the bf wanted to chill a little after a long day of work well we did chill alright an hour long chilled and waited for 2 entrees they sat us down at a booth that just had got sanatized therefore it was still wet and i mean wet wet with strong fumes that i breathed in for 10 minutes before it dries out then came the utensils wrapped in white napkins only if it was completely white how could you not see stains on both white napkins yet they put it neatly on our table as if nothing was there if that was how they present themselves to customers what could possibly be behind closed doors no acknowledgement whatsoever of timing and we had to ask how much longer for her to go check after 50 minutes wait the food came overcooked they forgot the bananas that supposed to be on the french toasts asked for it and didnt get it till the toast was almost gone overall quality of service and food were one word poor never again
  i was mildly apprehensive based on the mixed reviews i ve read this two hippies is a a nondescript strip mall with a small sign on 7th ave being that it was the day of the race for the cure business was to be elevated i would have hoped for them to put out additional signage in order to lead people right to them like the a frame sign i saw sitting behind the counter but you know whatever the counter staff was friendly and coffee magically appeared literally within 15 seconds of ordering it lots of choices for the breakfast i got the waffle combo with crispy hash browns mind you i was bummed when my hash browns came out the opposite of crispy if you want to get picky they are not hash browns but instead are breakfast potatoes my friend got a breakfast bowl which to both of our confusions did not come in a bowl the waffle was pretty good her toast looked to be a yummy thick cut egg bread i heard many of the complaints about the plastic and styrofoam usage here they appear to have heard it too because there is a sign at the register stating that they use some sort of earth friendly version i wasn t entirely put off by the plates but the cutlery proved to be the enemy to both my friend and i the small cut of the potatoes was near impossible to get on the tiny tines of the small plastic fork which much to my amusement lead my friend to enter a battle to keep the food on the fork long enough to make it to her mouth i quit laughing however when it came time for me to eat my waffle my waffle refused to submit easily to the wimpy plastic knife and lame o fork it became a battle of endurance trying to fight the tiny flimsy cutlery and slippery plastic plate as my waffle flailed around while trying to be cut into bites the decor is amusing for sure enough to keep you entertained for a couple visits i couldn t tell if it was the fact i had just done a 3 mile walk on less than 3 hours of sleep and i was a little loopy but i believe their intercom system had a voice changer on it which made it sound like that trippy 70 s psychedelic movie voice i heard good things in line about the stuffed french toast and apparently their salsa is pretty good i ll definitely give them another try there were enough things on the menu that caught my attention the prices are reasonable as we were eating breakfast a group of cops came in to enjoy a meal as well that is always a good sign cops know the city and in turn they know where the good cheap food is so chances are if you see a large group of cops eating a meal at a particular eatery then it is a place worth checking out
  the view of the city from this restaurant was gorgeous i loved it it was very romantic the food was okay a little over priced but the view made it worth it the lobster mashed potatoes were delish our server on the other hand was why i didn t rate this place with five stars ion or whatever his name was the worst server but otherwise it was such a beautiful experience
  i m going to go with the 3 5 stars as well we walked in without a reservation and got a great window seat right away i really did like the room it worked and was warm i had the asparagus soup which tasted well nothing like asparagus but it was a winner because the scallop in it was fabulous there was also a potato puree involved for my entree i had the salmon with crab bearnaise sauce fingerling potatoes and asparagus now my fault for ordering the asparagus soup with potato puree and then having repeat ingredients on my entree it kind of peeves me when restaurants have repeat ingredients it s a personal thing i kind of instantly found the bearnaise sauce a little cold but moved on the food was good old school good like it reminded me of something i d have years ago at dinner classic french but i did like it i found the service a little stuck between two different places they tried to give good fine dining service but i found these little upsells that i wasn t really buying into like coming over and trying to sell us a cognac flight after we both said we didn t drink cognac weird also giving us insane pours of our wine who does that we won t drink me just because it is in our glass lastly the cheese plate seriously needs to be worked on great concept but really generic cheeses there were about 7 different types that were the size of practically my fingernail they were things like gouda and white cheddar i have no idea what they were doing on there there was also this one cheese that they made look like a flower it was horrible and quite possibly the worst cheese i have ever tried overall i did like it for a vegas restaurant i could just really do without the little upsells they sneak in or maybe not be so obvious about it
  wowzah the selection of beers here is intense i got the illusive traveler grapefruit ale it s super refreshing and light a nice change from the 100 degree plus weather outside the game selection here is also great i love having random activities to do at bars thumbs up
  this place was recommended by a friend great recommendation indeed the atmosphere was great it felt like i was out of town like in a real big city if you know what i mean service was outstanding our server was very friendly always made sure to check in and at the same time gave us our space wonderfull food i had mussels and as picky i am with sea food i would order them again for sure we also shared a pretzel and it was great prices are reasnoble as well i am looking forward to a cooler weather outside to be able to seat on their beautiful patio
  delicious flavorful syrups that aren t overly sticky sweet ice is soft and doesn t melt to total liquid before you get to the bottom of the cup try banana with the cream on top
  the staple of the inland empire in sin city who knew thanks to yelp i found one of my favorite places for breakfast away from home the family and i enjoyed the typical great service reasonable prices and fresh food in vegas the kids and my wife had the french toast meals with eggs sausage and bacon i ordered the breakfast burrito which comes with sausage cheese scrambled egg and i added some pico de galo sauce oh so good and fresh the family and i enjoyed coming here for breakfast because it gave us a break from the strip and the expensive crazy busy buffets it s was a 5 minute drive for us from the flamingo it was nice to have a quiet breakfast and be surrounded by friendly staff keep up the great work farmer boys vegas don t forget breakfast is served all day woo hoo
  i stopped by sunrise cafe on a tuesday morning around 10 30 and to my surprise it was pretty packed it immediately assumed the food would be good the restaurant is pretty unique there s a standard open seating area a bar area and in various places you can find nostalgic items for sale we were seated right away the menu features a variety of breakfast and lunch specialities i opted for breakfast and chose jacob s platter it didn t take very long for our food to come out everything was hot and good especially the potatoes i would be completely content with a plate of cheese potatoes i did taste their homemade turkey sausage which is pretty awesome they were pretty successful in making turkey taste just as good as pork actually better service was excellent and prices were great if you have the entertainment book you there s a bogo 50 coupon i d return
  i quite liked this place for arizona honestly i would have given it a 2 5 if possible i just got take our for lunch from this place i ordered the green curry with beef and the eggplant dish with chicken the green curry was different from what i m used to not really in a bad way but not in a good i missed the veggies and bamboo shoots the meat was good quality it was a bit expensive for what it was so i dont know if ill return even though the place is right by my house i m used to eating thai food in california so my standards are a bit higher than what is offered out here in arizona i think that siam thai is much better cheaper prices and i will make the 15 20 min drive there over this place anyday
  the food drink here is amazing such a great ambiance if the weather is nice ask for a seat in the patio where the fountain makes it sound like you re dining next to a waterfall also if you bike in you get a discount
  i was underwhelmed by this dining experience the evening started out on the patio which was well heated the greeter sat us at stable for two next the door which seemed perfectly lovely until servers began to utilize the door it was constant slamming as the door had no stopper we asked if we could move as it felt like the glass window might shatter on us at any moment they happily moved us in doors you could still hear the constant slamming of the door but the possibility of shattered glass was no longer a concern we ordered the trio bruschetta to start although the presentation was lovely the dish lacked flavor then we had the kale and roma salad which again was bland and had no flavor finally we ended the experience with a white pizza with sausage and mushroom which sadly had very little flavor also the mushrooms appeared to be canned mushrooms and we re not fresh or high quality the only saving grace of his experience was the wine i would not recommend this establishment
  delicious donuts and friendly service my family and i have enjoyed their donuts on several occasions and our experience has always been great my kids love the inexpensive donut holes and my husband really likes the old fashioned we would definitely recommend it
  low prices fast service decent quality wouldn t have known about this place if they hadn t been featured on groupon even without a discount you can get a fairly healthy and filling lunch here for under 10 favorite pick is the salmon bento box portion of salmon chicken teriyaki and cali roll plus sides of mac salad and seaweed salad added on an order of eggrolls salmon was a little oilier than expected chicken was moist dark meat fried nuggets but i did not taste any teriyaki seasonings or sauce cali roll was fresh sides were just okay you can certainly do worse on this side of town interior has a small sushi bar a lounge like area with a tv and magazines and several tables walk up ordering format most of their orders seem to be takeout judging by the name and lack of dine in customers
  the food was decent but definitely not worth the money very limited menu and the portions were very small we had to wait 20 minutes for desert didn t realize it took 20 minutes for cheesecake the coffee was cold by the time desert came out this is one of the worst experiences that i ever had
  my kids literally dragged me here it seemed so far from where we live in centennial hills let me tell you i will gladly travel any distance for the food and service here outstanding
  i went here because all my friends were peeing their pants about how good it is wrong the slow perhaps retarted staff with no customer service alongside the barely mediocre tasting pizza both contributed to my disdain for this awful eatery fuck it stick to slices
  i live in the area of this restaurant and we decided to go for happy hour on tuesday i had low expectations for this place i was impressed they had modelo on tap for 2 which is a major plus the chips salsa beans and hot salsa were excellent with free refills on the chips and salsa 1 tacos on tuesday i was expecting a small crappy taco i was wrong this taco was awesome and you cannot beat the price i found my new taco tuesday place
  the sushi is amazing here the service needs a little help been there a few times recently and have never been attended to upon walking in someone either makes us wait at the front not sure why or tell us to seat ourselves which is fine but then there is always a wait for menus if it is really that hard to deliver menus to a table when people enter maybe just put menus on every table it s such a simple thing but when you are ducking in for a quick lunch and 5 minutes are wasted before water or a menu is delivered it s terrible once attended to the service is good and the food comes out fast and again the food is great
  i have been there twice and the second was a lot better than the first if its your first visit don t try to decipher the confusing looking order slip and just go straight to the counter portions are pretty good but the chile relleno has waaaay too much breading dont bother with the burritos and the cheese quesadillas since they are tiny and totally not worth the price the emerald jerk chicken and fried are excellent though i would still have to explore all of their menu to find what i like best
  one of the best meals i ve ever had and i m a foodie the ribeye was sliced cooked to perfection and ideally charred and flavored for dessert i had a stick made from frozen lemon custard rolled in toasted coconut and served over toasted marshmallow sauce drizzled with blueberry coulis might just have been the best desert i ve ever had like baked alaska but better the iced tea was berry flavored and delicious
  so for the longest time my boyfriend was going on and on about how great this place was i always thought he was exaggerating and i wouldn t agree if i ever tried the place sooo we finally went there together and i now must hang my head and say that i am a believer in metro pizza i got the chicken and herb calzone he got the small gotham the calzone which was huge had fresh tomatoes and herbs cheese was evenly melted and the chicken was nice and juicy as much as i hate to admit it though his pizza trumped all others i ve had in vegas the meat was juicy chunks of ground beef and pepperoni the crust was just the right amount of flaky and crunchy mmmmm our waiter was very sweet and polite he seemed to be a hard worker as he was not only helping us but cleaning about and doing other duties while the others didn t seem to be doing much unfortunately there was a weird smell towards the back of the restaurant where we were seated almost a wet table rag smell the food and service made up for it though definitely recommend metro pizza maybe as take out and i definitely will be back for more
  my favorites white tuna fresh scallops salmon belly consistently great quality
  food was pretty nondescript but it was the arrogant and rude service that is the catalyst for this rating my friend ordered a manhattan red apple martini even providing the breakdown of ingredients the bartender did not get it right as evidenced by the color of the drink since one of the three ingredients was equal part cranberry juice the drink s color should have been red to reflect it s name it was not when asked to correct the bartender argued and insisted he was right his manager simply shrugged with no comment after being told about the unsatisfactory response from the bartender needless to say this soured our visit which was the first it s a shame this restaurant precluded any future business including word of mouth because the adage the customer is always right wasn t adhered oh well adios
  i took my boyfriend here for a special night out and we were both in heaven everything we ate was utterly mind blowing i appreciated that i was trying japanese dishes that haven t been replicated at every restaurant in town the location of the restaurant is serene and the perfect compliment to the cuisine i cannot wait to go again
  everyone liked their food nice atmosphere tried to get a substitution of potatoes for spetzle no dice one we were done we felt pressure to get out and make room for the next batch of tourists
  it was okay not what i expected the toasted bun was nice but the flavor from the chipotle chicken was lacking both of the ice machines were out of ice so the fountain drink was not very cold for the money it could have been spent better elsewhere
  steer clear of this restaurant i thought how ad can it be it s probably similar to chipotle wrong i had the burrito bowl with tofu it was the worst tofu i have ever had i couldn t eat it i pretty much paid 15 for a small portion of rice and beans which weren t all that great either
  i m not sure why this place has such high reviews i guess people are more enamored by the experience than the actual food the decor is pretty cool it s definitely much more interesting than the average 24 hour diner there s a photographer who goes around and takes pictures but seriously i m not coming here for the decor at 3am i m coming because i need some food after a night out the food is extremely mediocre i d even say that it s below average in quality the portions are large however but who cares how much you get when you can t eat something because it just doesn t taste good i understand that this place isn t gourmet but i definitely expect food that s at least on par with the average diner i d rather go to mickey d s to eat than this place
  what a culinary adventure this was before dragging myself out i managed to try the pork shoulder tostadas the tots and the bone morrow among other things although all great the tostadas is an absolute revelation bursting in flavor it was alone worth the trip
  the food is decent and the service is okay what you are paying for is presentation and huge portions this is a good place to take out of towers just to hear them say wow that looks good the food just doesn t measure up to the high expectations that you ll have after seeing the food oh and you ll have to wait forever to be seated
  sushi was ok nothing special waitress was good prompt etc busser chased me away from my table even though they weren t busy and there were plenty of other tables that was no fun probably did it because i was by myself and not worth the mediocre sushi the waitress got a good tip but i won t be coming here again
  well i have to say with all the other options in scottsdale i wish i could turn back time and choose another let me start by saying that i have waited over a full week to post this review actually i was not going to post at all as my friend that went with me posted a perfect review of our experience here but here goes my friend came to town on a friday night for a girls weekend and we stayed at nearby firesky on a bike trip to breakfast the next morning we were riding through town when she saw posh and the improvisational cuisine got her to googling it as it sounded like a fun dining experience at no time was price a part of the decision to dine there or not we booked one of the later reservations on open table as they had them available and also arrived to the restaurant a full 15 minutes early we are both professional women with stressful and decision making jobs so any time we have the opportunity to unwind and have fun we cease the moment this night was no exceptions and so when our menu card asked us what our general dislikes were we didn t see the harm in poking fun and answering donald trump s hair and chef boy r dee from a can while also giving them the serious answers they needed mind you i also added that i am an omnivore and like anything and we both upgraded and paid extra to have wagyu beef this is where my issues come to play it is in my personal belief that the waitstaff and also the chef were very much displeased by us and may have taken it personally because we were barely spoken too for the rest of the meal we had ordered 6 courses not one time were we ever asked if we liked anything at all they would come and take plates and replace with the next course i would think if you serve someone kangaroo and you know they highly anticipated having it you would ask how they liked it they seemed bothered by us wanting to know what spices were in a specific dish and at the end never asked us would that be all the chef said goodbye warmly with a smile to every other table before us we were the last to leave not by our choice they serve when the food is ready so we were on their time at the end of the meal the only thing said to us was the waiter coming up and sarcastically asking if we didn t find any of donald trumps hair in our food or no spiders we left utterly unhappy during a time that we should have been enjoying our time together at a restaurant we hand chose to dine at soon after my friend ended up in the toilet for most of the night with gastric absurdities that i won t try to make you visualize cause let s face it we re all human and we ve all had our intestines disagree with us at one time or another in our lives we didn t want to assume that it was a coincidence but there was really no other place for our thoughts to go as the restaurant staff just seemed to be so upset with us as we dined on their grouper soft shelled crab kangaroo and beef wagyu by the way the food was very good i want to keep this factual also since i m trying to be very serious and fair they have a fantastic music soundtrack and if you seat dance it actually makes one of the female staff smile it was in my finding s tonight that made me upset enough a week later to write this review our bill came to 241 60 for the both of us again not the issue the issue is that we split the bill in half and now a week later i found 2 charges on my discover card one the night we were there and one the next night for 120 80 each so i reached out to my friend who said after checking that she also had 2 charges but one of her charges is being reversed so in total at this time they got 362 80 from us i have called discover to dispute the second charge i would like to think that this is a processing error but my heart says otherwise and if it was and error of this sort shouldn t be made at an upscale restaurant i feel like i m having a bad night all over again a week later because of a bike ride past a restaurant with a catchy name all in all i will never return and if you go here are my suggestions 1 do write with extreme seriousness your likes and general dislikes pertaining to food only 2 don t smile just nod and wave the plates away 3 do take the concept extremely seriously 4 don t ask the waiter why he brought you kobe steak when you upgraded for wagyu 5 do keep your receipt and check your charge and lastly try the kangaroo you ll be glad you did
  i don t believe i ve ever eaten better pizza brutta s got absolutely amazing wood fired crust unbelievable sauce and the freshest best toppings you can find the atmosphere is pretty good too i love the giant brick oven just behind the register the pictures on the walls the big windows facing monroe street and the cozy space i don t recommend going on an empty stomach however the pizzas are smallish and thin and they ll put a dent in your wallet for sure but for the best pizza ever i ve gotta give 5 stars
  before i came back to wa i went to lilibela for diner with daughter and it was a good dining experience for my first time trying ethiopian food i had the spicy chicken and lentils and it was delicious daughter had beef lentils and vegetables and they were also very good i highly recommend this restaurant for people that like trying different foods and are willing to experience what the world has to offer if you don t like spices curries and different vegetables this place is not for you i will go back there as soon as i go back to az
  super burrito should be sorry burrito we had always seen them around town with their van and had stated we wanted to try to the place when they opened up the location on tropicana it was definitely time to try it out it s a walk up drive through location so we walked up the staff was pretty friendly the guy had asked if we had ate their before and after our answer of no we were treated to some samples of their meat i decided on carne asada super burrito and the man went with chicken super burrito we waited in our car for our food and they were kind enough to bring it out the car for us the man was anxious to try his food so he immediately went in the bag and kept pulling stuff out asking me what else i ordered and where was his burrito much to our surprise our burritos were there just not so super they were flat not round at all and filled with mostly filler there was maybe 1 and 1 2 oz meat in each burrito i had just spent a little over 30 on two burritos a cheese quesadilla drinks and chips and salsa can i tell you how pissed off i was i will never try another super burrito in my life
  after driving by several times and doing a quick search on yelp i decided to finally try this place i had a craving for a good burger so the timing was right unfortunately my whole experience was bad from the beginning when we first walked in one of the servers walked right in front of us so we said hello he did not reply and completely ignored us while we ate i noticed that he was walking around with a blank stare looking at employees and serving tables like he was a loss prevention officer at best buy instead of a waiter why in the world would someone with this personality be hired by a restaurant i was expecting higher prices since this is a specialty burger place but the quality of the food does not hold up to their expensive menu the parmesan truffle fries were ok but had just faint hint of truffle in them the onion straws were not crunchy at all and were full of grease at the bottom of the plate the nick s patty melt that i ordered was soggy and the caramelized onions on top were more like boiled onions without a hint of brown come on a patty melt is pretty hard to mess up in general the whole staff seems to lack any basic customer service skills they were very inattentive seemed bothered when interacting with us and would disappear to go talk among themselves i got the impression that the staff feels that i should be flattered to have the opportunity to eat at such a hip and happening place a smile goes an long way people if you are going to charge high prices the service and the food must be impeccable
  still my favorite sushi restaurant despite some issues i ll give them one more chance to address the issues otherwise its time to search for a new place uni first time getting to taste it i got it when they were barely pulling it out the box nice creamy golden yellow color delicious amaeba i like shrimp but shrimp is just shrimp to me the first time i got this they put a dot of hot sauce on it not sure why on the revisit they swapped it out for fish eggs instead a much better choice that doesn t overpower the flavors of the sweet shrimp shrimp heads originally they fried just the shrimp heads the issue with this is the heads of the meat gets dried out if you re trying to crisp up the outside we re you can eat the shell and all on the revisit after my recommendation they dipped it in shrimp tempura batter before frying it much better and the meet wasn t dried out from the frying nothing left including shrimp eyes be sure to request it this way if they re not going with this methodology from now on sashimi platter the sashimi platter includes 2 cuts of tuna salmon and yellowtail fish was fresh and good the above items are limit 1 per ayce order and uni amaeba is for dinner only unagi the first 2 visits were excellent the last revisit was disappointing it was one of the few times i couldn t eat anymore of the eel it just had the slimy and almost mushy texture why couldn t they grill it properly like the previous times baked mussels again 2 visits were excellent but the last revisit wasn t so good it just wasn t baked fully through so i didn t get the awesome baked taste of the mussels mackerel the first revisit the mackerel came out a little too dry for my liking the last revisit was much more juicy and had more flavors delicious shumai this time they had pork again they fry it so there isn t much left to the item fish cutlet they re fishsticks nothing special about them it does remind me of the south park joke jimmy do you like fishsticks cartman yeah jimmy do you like putting fishsticks in your mouth cartman yeah jimmy what are you a gay fish calamari rings these weren t so good it was way too chewy even for squid to eat cheesecake it seems like the chef was experimenting with it first time she made it it came out in a tart like shape the cheese was way too hard second time it was actually a slice of cake it had way too much crust on it so you couldn t even taste the cheese mochi ice cream this was good consistency of good food is one of the most important things to me it doesn t matter if you can deliver great food once but if you can deliver great food time after time this place does have some quality control issues which i suspect is from the sushi chef in training daniel i m told he works friday saturday nights so you know which day to avoid if you can everything from the previous review not mentioned in this one is still applicable
  first off i will say that the food here was very good i went here with five other people last night and we were all really pleased with the appetizers and main dishes we seriously got a ton of food cheese fried oysters salads two half chickens gnocchi steak burger dessert almost everything on the menu also can t forget about the wine the list seems long but there really isn t a ton a great wines on there i wouldn t consider myself a wine snob who would but i don t think i would come back for the wine if you re into that food and wine aside the service was also great our waiter was super friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there really the only thing i was disappointed with was where they sat us we had a party of six so they sat us in an atrium they share with their neighbors it was quite too quiet eerily quite they had no music playing so our conversation echoed quite a bit i don t think this would be a problem if we were inside but it did take away from our experience slightly all in all i would totally go back just for the food it was very tasty
  this place is terrible with deliveries if this is the closest pizza place then i would suggest you don t go here or order carry out and pick it up yourself the last 2 times they have been between 60 75 minutes to deliver they also don t have the audacity to make it up carry out don t do delivery
  very good quality price ratio affordable lunch specials service is friendly and prompt combo plus plumb wine is a must to release the stress of a week on a friday night
  i d seen this place on tv a while ago and was curious i mean seriously mexican chinese fusion well it sounds whonky and a bit weird in function it is really good my first time there was a little daunting they were kind enough to let me try a few samples before i dove in since i was a chino bandido virgin i chose the combo venturing to try the emerald jade chicken quesadilla and a jade red chicken burrito with refried beans and the plain fried rice the jade red chicken was sweet and sour with a bit of kick in a tortilla much like you might get with a moo goo gai pan at places it was amazing the quesadilla was very nice the ginger green onion sauce was very tasty though there was a bit much on the oil in that sauce otherwise with the rice and beans it was delicious the staff was very nice from start to end the gal who helped me with the samples also took my order and dropped the food off not sure if that is normal but it was awesome she was very sweet and very helpful hopefully i am not out of line by mentioning she was quite cute too i am not sure how much of a regular i ll be but for an occasional treat and a sino mexican fix i ll be back for more
  this review is specifically about their food it isn t typical brewery tap house fare all the food they offer is of higher quality unique fresh and delicious everything i tried during my 2 visits has been top notch i can t wait to return well my diet can but my appetite can t so far i ve tried house made chips delicious fried pickles amazing kids mac n cheese eh but my kid scarfed it down baked buffalo wings wow french fries very good
  tied hek yeah for the first time today and i m really glad i did excellent pulled pork sandwich coleslaw was very tasty and the owner was super friendly even brought out a few tastes of some other creations he was working on in the kitchen all excellent btw loved the 3 varieties of sauce allowing a mix match approach blend sweet spicy to taste one big plus the actual meat was all good not one bite of anything that wasn t tender and tasty that ends up being the dividing line between meh ok and i ll come back again great food nice family vibe with the owners not a fancy decor but friendly and relaxed but at the end of the day it s the food and it s very good
  stopped by after reading the reviews well deserved service was quick polite and very helpful seems like a perfect grab and go spot for breakfast especially after a long night of drunkeness ordered the az buro and it hit all kinds of spots light but filling exactly what i wanted this morning will be back in a few hours for lunch
  this is a good mexican food restaurant the carne asada burrito was very good the salsa and spice also tasted good the decor wasn t super cool but the food makes up for it affordable and tasty good job
  great place for sushi and ramen on the strip you can shop at the forum and then do dinner the food is excellent and the atmosphere is hip and clean now considering it is on the strip there are tourists who can act like tourists we saw a group yelling saki bomb and then made a mess which the servers had to clean i was embarrassed for them i understand it is the strip and would not hold it against this place for us the servers were friendly and helpful my husband who does not do sushi enjoyed other their tempura this place has something for everyone
  sometimes you go to some fancy place that is all art and no substance other times you hit the buffet line that is all food and no joy in phoenix no one has blended the two as tastefully as st francis the ambiance is hip without being exclusive the building itself is very open and worth the trip in and of itself the menu while small is loaded with dishes that will hook you and ensure return visits as a starter i d recommend the pumpkin soup i m still trying to come up with an adequate superlative to describe the exhilaration i felt when that first spoonful made contact with my tastebuds the flavorful festival continues with the green chile pork the dish itself is somewhat small but surprisingly hearty and cap off the evening with a desert preferably in the form of the sticky toffee pudding this place does the city proud and is one more shining light in a re surging central corridor
  awesome place just heard about it s re opening on facebook and had to check it out when i arrived i noticed that i wasn t the only one who must have heard about them re opening the place was packed it was well worth the wait the service and staff were very friendly and prompt had the crab relleno and was loving every bite of it their bean dip and green salsa is also awesome was so impressed with the food that night i went back 2 days later to indulge again will definitely be coming here often
  not a fan of their ordering system come in order at a counter then sit down for delivery would have much preferred to sit down and order like at a normal restaurant burgers were extremely tasty as was the gourmet style milkshakes sodas are not your typical coke pepsi products but vanilla cream etc has a small bar with a small selection of microbrewed beer but nothing really to write home about dog friendly patio
  not impressed understaffed salad was wilted ice berg lettuce with grilled chicken that tasted a week old other family members had pulled park they thought is was ok they atmosphere was nice
  last time i was here it was a strange experience i dont even remember what i had i just remember not being impressed enough to yelp weird service dirty tables things like that fast forward about a year wanted a patio and decided to try this little spot im happy we did service was fantastic food was phenomenal and the place is cleaned up and adorable i had the monte cristo sandwich on french toast just delicious and filling nice portion for 11 bucks we also tried the pesto omelet stuffed with veggies and cheese their homemade potatoes were bomb and the regular french toast is made of angels wings i think absolutely delicious being a little cafe next to cornish pasty can t be easy but cafe alo seems to be holding their own awesome
  love this place awesome pulled pork catfish mac n cheese and hushpuppies they also do greens the first sat of the month its a small place for dine in or take out
  i absolutely love this place beers are amazing there the piranha pale ale is definitively my favorite food is also great i tried several things on the menu and i never was disappointed their lunch specials are very good deals refill soups and salads
  went here last week with a group from work the service was less to to be desired when we spoke to the manager co owner took care a an issue we had but by that time the rest of our party left we will not be back and i would not recommend going out of your way to go to the bar there are other bars in the area that are 100x better in food and service
  one of the best place go to for breakfast i highly recommend this restaraunt fast service and great food
  we were in town for a few days and wanted a quick bite what a mistake the staff was rude and seemed like asking questions about the various items was an insult to them they seemed more interested in their cell phones than the customers when the food finally came it was disappointing and believe it or not taco bell would have been a better choice and a chipotle would blow their doors off never again
  pin kaow used to be my favorite thai place in all of vegas but we moved away and when we came back after 5 years we discovered that things had changed and i m afraid that it s not for the better to be fair the place looks very pretty inside since the renovations and the waitresses now wear traditional thai attire which is very cool but the food portions are much smaller and the food quality seems to have suffered a bit as well perhaps the customers are now paying for the cost of renovations the thai tea tasted like regular iced tea mixed with coffee and nutrasweet the spring rolls were lackluster and kind of pasty inside and the chicken soup was very salty which is a complaint that i rarely ever have seeing as how i m a card carrying salt fiend that has actually been known to add salt to toast i shit you not the pad see ew and pad prik king were both tiny no seriously both were itty bitty teensy weensy portions maybe a cup worth of food per entree at most and honestly the food just doesn t seem to be anywhere near as flavorful as it used it be it was just kind of bland needless to say we were extremely disappointed because this place used to be so good luckily we found thai grill on n decatur which is even better than the old pin kaow which is saying a lot because boy did pin kaow ever used to be good
  overpriced the food was alright the service there was absolutely horrid i get better service at roberto s lol the drinks took forever to get the food came out overcooked and super late half the party was completely done eating and the other half had not yet even received their food the manager was terrible will never go there again
  great meal started with the garbage caesar loaded with shrimp house specialty osso bucco perfect loaded with marrow freddie is a great host try his special post dinner shot
  we went here on my husbands birthday after a long day meandering through old montreal when we arrived after a lazy glass of wine around the corner there was literally no one in the place 6pm we popped in because the menu looked good and were seated right away without a reservation the waiter was extremely friendly and helpful the bread was melt in your mouth delicious the type of bread you could just eat as the main meal with a few full glasses of wine but i digress we split the gnocchi named something else on the menu but the waiter educated us an appetizer about 6 pieces of pasta each it was was out of this world the eggplant parmesan was also very good the scallops were just ok but we both didn t finish off our half portions the wine was delicious and a chocolate flour less something or another for dessert left us full and smiling
  scrambled eggs eggs benedict smoked salmon smoked trout dragonfruit sausage gravy and biscuits prime rib steak potatoes lyonais melon strawberries oatmeal with caramelized peaches and pecans jook with shredded pork waffle bacon sausage cheese bread strawberry tart chocolate cake those are all the things i had for one breakfast at the bellagio buffet heavenly five stars
  i had passed this restaurant dozens of time without knowing what magic was behind the plain building i was very pleasantly surprised upon walking in at around 9pm on a friday night to see ducks and turtles swimming around the tables outside were filled with lovers adding to the romantic ambiance of el encanto there was a older gentleman singing spanish love songs while playing the guitar it was like another world from the street that we entered from it almost felt like a secret club for some reason and i was happy to have found it anyway on to the food i shared the pollo fundido with my other half i wasn t too impressed because i still think x tapa joe s has the best pollo fundido in town but the yellow rice that accompanied the dish was superb usually i am disappointed at the dry and bland mexican rice that comes with entrees not here it tasted like the yellow rice that i make which is moist and rich in flavor the margaritas were a bit too sweet but still okay overall i thought it was a great place for a date night as it seeped with romance i would love to try another dish sometime to give them a higher rating but so far the 3 stars i gave it seems right on point
  i ve gone to several diners drive ins and dives restaurants yayo taco is the first place i can truly say was a dive that s not a bad thing because the atmosphere was fun wish i could be there on a friday night with unlv in session i had three tacos pollo carne asada and bombay the pollo was amazing and i could have eaten several more the carne asada was tasty with a little bit too much spice for my taste and i ll skip the bombay next time amazing selection of beers which i tried and tequilas which i did not
  had a ridiculous lay over in phoenix so i got a chance to check this place out everything we had super taste i am very partial about my penang curry pretty much there s only a few places that do it right and this places is one of them so tasty the mango curry was also great and the thai fried rice was delicious totally worth going off my low carb diet for a day
  this is an update of my previous reviews for atl wings i think i ve pretty much tried 90 of the menu my favorites are still the seasoned and honey habanero wings like i said voodoodaddy s wings held a special place in my heart and atl s seasoned wings are the second coming i ve tried both the fried catfish and the fried tilapia the tilapia is smaller but i prefer them because of the flavor i ve tried the fisherman s platter and it is tasty fried flounder shrimp scallops and fries cole slaw the main reason i decided to update my review is because i have noticed that there are some people that are so hung up on how long the food takes to make sometimes the food is made to order sometimes they get people who order a few dozen wings sometimes they get people who order party platters that consist of 100 wings atl s wings are so good that they are rapidly outgrowing their facility they are in need of a larger restaurant with a much larger kitchen with double or even triple the amount to fryers they currently have my advice call in your order before heading out to atl wings even if you plan to eat there call in your order it will take a while to get your food but when you get your food it will be delicious it s well worth the wait but that doesn t mean you can t do the waiting in the comfort of your own home
  i like this place a lot it s not bad but i like to go on sundays because of their oysters surprisingly they are fresh and juicy just like any oyster bar out there or even better but this one is steal deal not fancy just casual they do have limited food but i m okay with it they also have fresh sashimi at their sushi stations again limited rolls but i truly understand just a big boo hoo on their dessert my only favorite was their cream puffs which was seriously filled up with cream
  not bad not like in and out good burgers kinda pricey the fries werent that great either but i do find myself craving another one of their burgers
  really really strange discombobulated style part bordello part barbershop crate tiled ceilings and 80 s arcade very spacious very eye catching in not a very good way ordered the marsala and lasagna factory plate two main dishes on a huge plate no sides just a huge bread it was actually enough for me and my bf to split between the two of us all in all it was pretty charming
  one of the last remnants of the jewish area in mile end wilensky s light lunch isnt its smooshed beef baloney and cheese on a roll all of it pressed like a cuban the place is more of a museum than a jewish deli
  we finally made it here for breakfast lunch and i guess we will make there again some time in the future the wait staff was quick to greet and get us our drinks and order after that it was awhile before the food got to us the highchair s seat belt was broken such a nuisance for our little girl but oh well safety is not first here i guess the joe s special pancakes and florentine omelet my husband s choice were all delicious i am interested in their lunch and when i have more time and the kids are at the sitter s i will stop by again to see how that goes
  i have been going to bailey s for two years to watch the ufc pay per view events their food is good beer selection is good they have good specials and the atmosphere is good they have tons of tv screens too so why did i only give them two stars the bathroom the men s room is the most filthy disgusting poorly designed atrocity i ve ever seen it reminds me of the toilet in trainspotting there are two urinals that are six inches apart two people cannot use them at the same time because they re too close together and there is no divider the last time i was in there the dividing wall around the toilet had been pulled almost completely out of the wall too i will overlook a lot of things but this is just the worst ever
  a bit hard to find and average this is the kind of restaurant that is not exciting definitely a bit hard to fine the decore is average the food is average and the services is average when you go out in vegas you want to be in a place that is exciting alive vegas style we went their because of the 5 star rating but we were both disapointed my pasta carbonara was a bit greasy and my wife very simple pomodoro was a bit blend our server was friendly italian food is not very complicated fresh ingredients good seasoning and great pasta
  well if one thing s for certain it s that heading out to the middle east has completely destroyed my opinion of falafel for small city madison banzo is good compared to big city ny it s average compared to israel no bueno when i ordered my falafel and asked for the red and green chili sauces it was met with a blank stare this my friends is not falafel the hummus is too thick the falafel balls lack flavoring and they don t even have the green hot sauce the red is far far too runny to be remotely legit where s the shredded carrots the pickles the cabbage sigh thanks a lot israel you ve officially ruined falafel for me
  this place sucks food is horrible and wayyyyy over priced fast food taste better
  i would like to give them four stars but unless you pay careful attention to your order there is a very good chance they will screw it up i don t get a good vibe from the staff either i have yet to have real bad service but i get the impression they don t really care that s fast food i only go back for a few reasons the quality of food is slightly better than mcdonald s and bk my son loves it and you can substitute chili for fries
  yuk sorry but the food was awful tried nicks three times now won t be back the service was really bad too i really wanted to like this as it s so close to my house
  love this place hope to see more through the valley i can walk in and get one dish and be happy and satisfied through the day i really like this place
  ate here yesterday for the first time definitely a fan of the vibe we sat up on the roof patio and it was like a garden oasis in the middle of the baum center eyesore the decor managed to almost completely block out the view of ritters and the upmc parking lot next door a major plus the inside was as others have already commented very pastel and outdated reminding me of my grandmother s 80th birthday party definitely could use an overhaul in my opinion but then again there were quite a few old ladies there so maybe they just know their crowd i ll cut to the chase the food was great for not super expensive there were large quantities many options a very helpful waitress who helped us make some very difficult choices and a clear willingness to tailor anything on the menu to suit our needs one last thing about the service which is what earns cafe sam its 5th star we were running late to see a play after dinner which was our own poor planning but as soon as we alerted the waitress to the situation she bent over backwards to get us our food as quickly as possible take out containers so we could finish on the road and the check paid without delay it was definitely above and beyond the call of duty and we wouldn t have made it on time without her help great food great service weird but nice decor i ll definitely be back
  i d give the food a 3 5 and the actual restaurant a 5 5 the food was really just okay but this place looks great
  we have been dining bluephies for 13 yrs now it s been the only restaurant that we would dine at a great menu laid back but interesting atmosphere the best bloody mary s we have had however the last two times we have been there one of them being two weeks ago we noticed that the quality of the food both taste and preparation were off one time it s an off day twice and we start to worry the next time we go to madison we will skip them to give someone else a chance we won t abandon them but if the next time we go if it s off we will be upset we live an hour and a half away and we have driven there just to dine tighten it up
  some pros they don t close in the middle of the day like most thai restaurants they deliver 3 fee 15 min purchase my fiance and i have eaten a lot of thai food in many places so we re thai food snobs if you re like us then you ll likely find this place as we did mediocre we ve had of varying spice levels and veg meat options fresh spring rolls paw pia sod egg rolls paw pia tod green curry kang khiaw wan bangkok steak basil fried rice basil duck fried rice thai style pad lad nar on menu but i always thought it was lard na panang curry tom yum soup best picks from what we ve tried there seems to be a shortage of fresh vegetables in dishes i e panang curry with bell peppers is 5 tiny pepper strips i ve counted fried rice dishe pics shown with cucumbers but comes with none mushrooms are rubbery etc we keep ordering because they deliver and it ll do in a pinch when one has a craving for thai
  grabbed some beers with my girls after a long week growlers has an amazing ambiance if you are looking for that pub feel this place is perfect the beer selection is fantastic they ran out of bells amber while we were there but that gave me the opportunity to try some other ones i wouldn t have gone for we split a dip sampler which included humus salsa and beer cheese the salsa was pretty spicy for my taste but amazingly fresh we will definitely be back for sure
  i stopped by daisy cafe recently for lunch with a friend and will definitely be back partly because of how many chorizo dishes they have i love chorizo from the moment we walked in the door the staff was incredibly friendly and eager to tell us about the delicious looking cupcakes in their display case we were immediately seated and quickly brought the homemade arnold palmer which was quite tasty unable to resist the call of chorizo i ordered the chorizo strata the bread cubes were perfectly toasted and the spicy yummy flavors of the pepperjack cheese and chorizo blended beautifully in each bite my friend ordered the daisy burger and although i loved my strata i have to admit that i couldn t help but steal bites of his burger throughout the entire meal the chicken patty was so moist and flavorful that i just couldn t resist i will likely order it myself when i visit again to end our wonderful meal we shared one of the month s featured cupcakes the blues with a sweet potato cake filled with bbq bacon chocolate ganache and topped with a whiskey buttercream this was definitely unlike anything i had ever tried before and it was amazing it was very tasty but having sampled many cupcakes before i would say that the cake lacked a bit of moisture still delicious though daisy cafe is definitely a place worth visiting not only is the food delicious but every member of the staff is extremely eager to share information about their menu and cupcakes
  ayce is always a must with my group of friends when they come to vegas everything they do here is out of control excessive gambling drinking and partying to finish off the weekend there is also a need for excessive eating since they didn t get much nutrition in their bodies all weekend food 26 95 for all you can eat sushi dinner this is probably one of the best ayce sushi spots that i ve tried the nigiri portions come out small which isn t much of a problem since it s ayce the menu is really extensive there are plenty of options including the kitchen items the only items they limit per person is the uni and the ama ebi sweet shrimp dessert it even includes ayce dessert green tea ice cream lychee sorbet amazing tempura vanilla ice cream they also have green tea creme brulee but they limit it to one order per person service wow the staff here are quick i came with a group of 9 and they brought out everything with alarming speed i guess it s expected because they only gave us a 1 hour time limit on the ayce
  wow excellent food great local place to eat unique flavor my first yelp review support local business
  i completely understand that this place closed shorty after its opening it was the worst indian food i ve had in canada flavourless
  i love this place
  i love dish parking is hard but it s got a nice ambience dim but also not loud so you can have a pleasant conversation the portions are a perfect size i ve loved everything that i ve eaten here especially the mushroom pasta except the olives which have a citrus zest didn t go well with my palette great for a nice evening out or for a special occasion you won t regret coming to this spot
  tried to get seated 2 people at the bar 2 tops completely empty yet they wouldn t seat us instead we re told 20 30 minute wait horribly rude hostess not even an explanation why we couldn t be seated
  first of all the hamburgers are better than the pizzas the service is crappy and they only deliver when they are dead also i m pretty sure that boxers and most athletes eat this type of food
  great job on the the drivers and the cook that made the food i do have a problem with who i order it from tho
  buy a burger put on your own toppings and destroy why so serious
  the hubby and i had a yummy lunch on our day date today i had the 37 pork shrimp fried egg on the perfect white rice the hubby had the 47 steak bells onions rice we also shared the potstickers app i like the iced tea a lot very mild green tea the app was my favorite part very good i loved the fried egg on the rice and really the rice was the example of what perfect rice is the pork chop was very yummy i tried the hubby s steak and it was very good and i love the deep caramel onions wish there were more i wasn t blown away with the salad and sauce saigon kitchen set that bar high for me i very much look forward to coming back trying other things on the menu like pho in the winter oh yeah
  we re not at olive garden anymore thank goodness my mom and i came in wednesday night for dinner we wanted to go somewhere we don t usually go it was pretty busy around 6 30 pm and we were we seated right away in a booth our server sweet young girl asked if we ve been to carrabas which we said not in a while she then mentioned everything is prepared fresh so you can easily omit ingredients from your dishes if you prefer cool my mom started with a riesling and i tried the peach sangria we were both happy campers when the yummy warm bread arrived with seasoned olive oil dip we split the harvest salad which had beets hazel nuts carrots goat cheese pretty good not some bagged salad wow that s nice for a change we also shared the spaghetti with italian sausage and oven pizza with mozzarella and pepperoni we enjoyed both dishes and ate it all love how the mozzarella on the pizza was golden melted and well cooked throughout with a crisp bottom what a nice home cooked meal with quality and service our server was friendly and personable truly taking the time to do it right kudos to the kitchen for serving up steaming hot fresh flavorful italian
  this place is really nice open and very modern looking with clean lines i shared a prime rib panini with my husband and the cinnamon roll both were delicious i don t eat beef very often but when i do i expect it to be good this was excellent i am actually craving one writing this review i saw other items being delivered that looked great the french toast looked so good and the hash browns seems so yummy i almost ordered a side our service was prompt and friendly it is a counter order kind of place i am sure i will be back for some more parking in the area is tight if you are going to stay longer than 30 minutes i am not sure what they will do once other restaurants open i will try to go during off peak times
  its okay the food is good the service ok although i do like their outside porch and dine in area
  great homemade food great service the owner is super nice and knows what she is doing keep up the great work the patio out back is perfect to sit out on a nice evening candy candy everywhere
  the food is really really delicious here i was very satisfied with it however our server was horrible he forgot my friends orders and he got it wrong as well it took so long for someone to give us menus as well we had to ask for water because they didn t bother to stop by to see if we needed a refill or not also they took away the soy sauce salt and pepper even thought we were not finished using it it was close to closing so it wasn t even busy yet they still took forever to get our checks the food is good but is it really worth it when the service is horrible
  the atmosphere dark modern but welcoming there are about ninety elevated flat screens with every game and the omnipresent sportscenter the bar area is spaced out very well so everyone is not right on top of one another the bar is a good size wrap around type the service excellent each time i ve been in i ve received personal service from friendly wait staff or bartenders the managers greet customers as well and the staff seems to be a great team the food good nothing mind blowing but above average fresh meat good sauces and good veggies you don t come here for a culinary experience anyway but you ll leave full and happy the drinks good prices even outside of happy hour small tap selection but this is gilbert they have chilled mugs which is cool overall blue 32 exceeds my expectations whenever i go in all in all it provides a cool sports bar contrast to the pub next door
  i come here for lunch occasionally and the food is pretty decent
  i like the food here it s a fast chinese lunch place so don t expect the best chinese food that said it is good prices are very reasonable and i have had good experience with the seafood dishes generous with shrimp the servings are very large two lunches even for a big appetite crab rangoons are a particularly nice treat
  my favorite brazillian bbq anywhere we try to hit this place up every time we re in vegas the meat is always really good but what sets this place apart from the rest including fogo de chao is the salad bar other yelpers have said it already but i ll reiterate the lobster bisque is amazing they also have sushi sauteed mushrooms cheese and some of the best cheese bread i ve eaten and for the ladies this place is full of attractive male waiters unlike the rest of vegas which pretty much caters only to your husbands boyfriends it makes the phrase bring your meat over here mean something completely different if it s me or my wife saying it a must try in sin city
  monta chaya is my all time favorite place for comfort food the menu is simple and there s something for everyone i ve tried almost every dish on the menu and have never been disappointed the quick efficient and friendly service makes returning so easy
  this is one of the restaurants my husband really wanted to visit while on our vegas vacation last week we were just going to grab some pastries to go so we could munch on them at our leisure however we decided to go full on breakfast at the last minute first of all the restaurant itself is just lovely elegant blue decor puts you at ease as soon as you walk in there is also a very nice outdoor seating area if you are so inclined service was great our server was very expeditious in taking our order bringing our food and checking on us throughout the meal the first thing we did was sample one of their pastries on special which was a chocolate almond croissant this was absolutely amazing the perfect way to start out breakfast they also have a special deal where you can get 4 pastries for 13 which sounds extremely cheap compared to most of las vegas we had them box some up to go for us which made us anticipating the next morning s breakfast in a hard core can t wait stomach growling sort of way i chose the brioche doree for my main meal this was a delicious french toast served bread pudding style layered with custard caramelized apples and bananas drizzled in maple syrup it was so delicious comforting moist soft oozy all your favorite food adjectives rolled into one i ate all of it and i never ever ever eat all my food my husband ordered the petit dejeuner americaine which was two eggs any style with bacon sausage pastry brioche toast juice and a bouchon blend coffee out of all that he was mostly in awe of the toast he took a bite then sat back and kind of zoned out for a bit said it was amazing which is kind of an odd thing to say about toast but i suppose it is brioche that is made at bouchon so it probably is amazing we split a side of lyonnaise potatoes and i highly highly highly two thumbs up suggest you order these with your meal ugh so good in fact i could ve used a whole plate of these like a huge ginormous plate in order words don t split this side it is definitely a single serving and you ll want them all for yourself wish we were locals so we could go back and try lunch or dinner cuz if breakfast is any indication of what they re capable of i have no doubt we could eat here all day every day and never feel it necessary to leave
  pittsburgh deserves this restaurant food and atmosphere some of the best in the city rivals some of the coolest places in la the only the negative i can say is service is so so but pittsburgh in general has pretty average service make sure you make a reservation and get the beef tar tar and get over the bathroom its not that big of a deal
  i have to say this restaurant was my favorite one until today so disappointed right now i don t usually write reviews but i really need to do it just got off from work walked a few blocks to get there patio totally empty and they refused to serve a table for me because my 23 pound dog two weeks ago went to the restaurant and they didn t have any issues with my dog the hostess said it is the rules really since when how come this wasn t the case last time this shows the poor management please be consistent if i bringing my dog with me it is because i have been allowed to eat there before my dog is not the first one that i have seen there before please don t waste my time i prefer to miss the food than coming back ever again to this place maybe you are more lucky than me and can get service without any rejections
  the chicken was very delicious covered in a bright and savory seasoning the chicha morada was ok not as flavorful as some other varieties as i ve had papa huancaina was a bit disappointing because it came out cold but still was not bad the meal was also very affordable a great place for lunch or dinner to go
  morning glory isn t cheap but it s delicious fresh organic local food and totally worth i went on recommendation of a coworker and was not let down i had the monte cristo and wow the brioche french toast was incredible and the egg and everything else was perfectly cooked the wait time was well over an hour perhaps because we went on valentine s day but it was definitely worth it and as an awesome extra bonus their coffee cups lids are compostable
  i had a dark roast over ice with light soy milk because i am on a no sugar or sweets fast and it was pretty good i really wanted to try their banana cream latte but could not have the sugar oh well i will try to go back when i can enjoy some sweets and try their flavored lattes and pastries the customer service was stellar and the inside of the coffee shop was filled with unique trinkets etc
  best tacos in vegas
  if you get nothing else here get the tom kha soup it is seriously the best i ve ever had anywhere i m not trying to be hyperbolic but this tom kha soup is the standard for which i compare all other tom kha soups i ve yet to find its match it is truly delicious i usually get the veggie variation loaded up with silky smooth tofu and tons of veggies but any variation is just as wonderful i just returned home from a trip to thai cuisine with some friends the environment is comforting and warm i love the lights strewn along the windows they just add to the coziness of the place after getting the obligatory veggie tom kha soup i got the green curry with shrimp others in my party got the yellow curry and the panang curry and everyone was pleased with their choices the green curry was a perfect balance of sweet and spicy and the veggies were nice and crisp they were featuring their mango and sticky rice dessert i had a bite of my friend s and i was sad that i was too full to have a dessert of my own as we rolled out of our booth totally stuffed and satisfied we all proclaimed that this was the best decision we could have made with our night definitely one of the best thai restaurants in the city
  never been here before i used a coupon from livingsocial the place is really small but clean has outdoor seating too food came out fast and as i expected my kids like their food the cashier was nice and friendly she told me that they also have kids menu which i didn t see on their board i will be back for more
  man i love me some noodles and i ve been dying to try this place problem is it s on the other end of town and i wasn t sure if there was even anything i could eat being a vegetarian and all we tried calling ahead to see if there s anything suitable for vegetarians on the menu but we were having a little bit of a language barrier the super cute voice on the line told me that i just need to come in and let them know i was veg and they ll find something for me well ok i guess we ll give it a shot we got to beijing noodle cafe and it s just a small place and nothing super fancy but nondescript places like these are the ones i always end up falling in love with when i got inside i met the cute little voice i talked to on the phone and she ended up being a cute little lady that tried her best to answer our questions but unfortunately there was still a bit of a language barrier i asked several times if there was any chicken broth or fish based sauces in the meat free menu items and she said that they were ok i m just hoping that they were alright especially since they were amazing and i want to go back like today we started with the vegetable pancake and it was soooo good it was nicely fried without being greasy and it tasted great with the sweet soy sauce my husband ordered the kung pao tofu and it had a nice blend of fried tofu veggies sauce and of course those incredible noodles the noodles were nice and chewy and perfectly cooked the portion was huge and he was in love i originally ordered the homemade tofu but the owner chef stopped over to the table and said he recommended the tomato egg noodle soup i again asked if there was chicken broth or anything non veg and they said it was ok i honestly wasn t sure if i was going to like it since tomato and egg doesn t really seem like the best combo scrambled eggs with ketchup baffles me but i decided that i was in for adventure so i heeded the words of the random guy usually my instinct is right but i am more than happy to say it was wrong this day mr random guy gave me some excellent advice because the tomato egg noodle soup was amazing the broth had a lot of flavor from the tomatoes egg and soy and it worked great with those yumtastic homemade noodles i slurped it down and smiled contently while hoping that my husband wouldn t want to steal them from me he did my husband isn t a big fan of eggs and even he gobbled up this delicious soup with bellies full to the brim we got the check and saw a grand total of 21 dollars 21 bucks for a ton of food between the price the friendliness of the staff and the overall goodness of our food i think it s fair to give this place 5 stars
  the quinoa stuffed avocados were amazing the kids had chicken best i ve ever had green beans and sweet potato fries excellent healthy peruvian style lunch
  this venue is legit seriously i love it the fact that there is a bowling venue that offers amazing non bar food and bands concerts love is huge for me i have staff that deserves staff outings and incentives and this is the place to take them although it s a little spendy it is a fun time not the under 18 family venue you might want but definitely a fun one
  best burger i was hesitant about the white chocolate bun but it turn out to be one of the best burgers i have ever had i got the groupon and it was definitely worth it
  well thank goodness for another fabulous recommendation on triple d we were tempted to try both the chicken coop and breakfast enchiladas for breakfast but opted to actually share the breakfast enchiladas we arrived before 9am and there was a small wait very friendly staff owner kept coming out and visiting guests and helping staff the enchiladas were plenty to share actually and very filling we will be back to try the coop who doesn t love stuffing for breakfast
  needed a pizza fix while overnighting in henderson yelp didn t let me down enzo s makes a great new york style thin crust pizza the pepperoni and sausage are just like you get in new york they have a small dining area about 8 10 tables or you can order take out as i did was ready in 15 minutes delivery is also available in a limited area i would definitely recommend these guys
  i am a big fan of gastropubs espcially when they are as elevated as the citizen is we requested to sit next to the open window that faces the street it was a beautiful november evening so a slight breeze was welcomed while we enjoyed our meal our server clark was absolutely charming he gave excellent recommendations when we needed some advice and he was able to joke around with us as we inhaled everything brought to our table our cobb salad our pork belly the cocktails dessert everything some of the items we tried pork belly pastrami house made and freaking delish melt in your mouth good the original chopped salad awesome presentation fair trade short ribs roasted buttermilk chicken grilled lamb loin moe scow mule coper cup and everything citi zen very refreshing i m not a vodka fan but this was smooth and sweet we will have to visit the citizen pulic house next time we re in town
  my advice come here for the beer if you re in the university area but skip the food flying saucer does have an amazing selection of beer especially great beers on tap i m not sure how many they have but it s more than 30 on certain days you can pay 3 4 and get some sort of mystery beer what can i say i love the mystery of it i got a mexican logger and thought it was pretty good their menu has pretty standard bar fare with sandwiches wings and pizza their pretzels were decent but i had a river rocket sandwich and was thoroughly unimpressed for the portion sizes and quality their food is seriously overpriced one sunday my partner and i came in while he got an oil change it was probably a little before noon and we came here because we thought breakfast places would be busy we intended to just get lunch but lo and behold we say people with plates and breakfast food on them not knowing anything about it and asked the waitress who did not tell us much except that apparently it is 11 if you are not a member it turns out this was a terrible idea so i asked if they had coffee which they did served in a regular beer glass it was a very weird situation for us all the food on it was cold it had only eggs sausage potatoes and some muffins first off it was gross second there was barely anything left on it and they were not refilling it when we left it was all gone it would have been nice for our waitress to tell us this before we ordered but she looked like she could not be bothered i probably would have complained but we decided instead to pay and leave it was a lesson learned to check the buffet before just blindly ordering another family came in afterward for the buffet which turns out had no food on it by that time i can t believe the waitress did not warn us of this before we ordered because of this last experience i don t think i ll ever go back i have no doubt sunday afternoon is just a bad time to come but this visit just completely soured me on the place they really have nothing here i can t get somewhere i like better
  my son told me about maui dog he is always trying new places i like the locally owned restaurants the experience just seems more personal there was 6 in our group and we tried a variety of items off the menu i got the island dog with tater tots there was an order of the spam sliders we shared the place is decorated island style i have been to the hawaii many times and when you go to the outer islands this is just what you might find we were there on saturday and after the lunch hour so the place only had a few people eating this gave me the opportunity to talk to the owner he is really a super nice person he shared how he got the idea from some time spent in hawaii the food i have eaten at a several places around phoenix that specialize in hot dogs i am not going to mention names but they are all well reviewed places everything from a hot dog on a bun with fixings to a place that advertised chicago style hot dogs maui dog was by far better than the rest it is not just a hot dog or a brat with some fixings it is a combinations of tastes that make the experience who would of thought coconut mango pineapple would be good on a hot dog yes they are sweet if you don t like sweet they can make your hot dog to order just ask when you eat their hot dog or brat you don t just taste the hot dog or brat the mixture of flavors when you bite into one of their hot dogs is what makes this place so unique i live in peoria and it is a 45 min drive to eat at maui dog i will be back to see if they taste as good the second time as the first the place was clean the food was good the service was good the price for what you got was good the location need one closer to peoria i will be back if you just want a hot dog fix it at home yuck if you like something different see them
  we were in charlotte for a wedding and ended up going out later for dinner even at 10pm there were people in the restaurant one of the parties was a group of 10 the server was polite and patient my salty lassi was great we also had a lamb samosa type appetizer that was fresh and tasty we tried the poori and naan best poori ever naan was good too but is always good lamb vindaloo and chicken makhni my go to dish were perfect too bad i don t live in charlotte
  awful run to taco bell you ll get better food there i ordered a combo with rice and beans guess what i received a burrito wrapped in paper and a side order of rice and beans that came in a separate container how is that a combo food quality is substandard i ve never had such bad mexican food as i ve had in arizona unfortunate any hole in the wall in the sf bay area or seattle offers 10x better latin food than 95 of places in arizona i think the epicurean standards here are extremely low
  meatball sandwich was awesome meatballs the bread and sauce date night dinner with my daughter good stuff
  the food here is always great this time my the number of people in my party was 7 for lunch which forced us outside the normal enclosed dining area being outside the area it was more difficult to get the same attention if we were inside the boundaries i realize the lunch period is always busy but this lunch took over 90 minutes which caused our customer to have to leave as soon as they were done eating i will eat here again but with a smaller party next time so we can be seated inside their eating area and not near the resort entertainment attraction
  for our first visit to station square we were looking for a place to grab some dinner before a night out at whim there is no shortage of restaurants in station square but they re all i think chains and franchises and nothing really caught our fancy i remembered houlihan s from my childhood back in michigan and the menu looked tasty so we stopped in to check it out boy is this not the houlihan s from my childhood a glance at their wikipedia page shows that back in 2002 houlihan s revamped their concept from a cozy family restaurant to a still cozy but more trendy restaurant fit for both families and for other groups of folks it s still pretty casual and we felt overdressed in our club clothes they have a large drink menu with some interesting options like a martini flight that lets you try smaller portions of cocktails i ordered the x rated flirtini which i was a little embarrassed to say out loud but it ended up being a tasty sweet and strong concoction of champagne and vodka with some exotic fruit juices unfortunately our server forgot to bring it out i did remind him after our appetizers had already come and then he went off to get it but i was disappointed that the whole thing took about 15 minutes by the time i got it our entrees were out there is a foursquare deal here for a free order of fries when you check in so we took advantage and ordered the truckstop fries which were covered in chipotle cheese sauce they were tasty and we observed that they were less salty than we expected which was a good thing i definitely didn t get the chipotle flavor which to me is smoky and rich they were clearly going for a southwestern vibe i think there were scallions and such on the fries but the chipotle flavor was missing we ordered some mini sliders that were tastier than we expected i think the pulled pork in particular we enjoyed and we split the brentwood chicken sandwich which was simple but fresh and well prepared it was a good amount of food for two people and we were way too full for dessert i wouldn t go out of my way to return here but i feel like this is a good option if you are down in station square and need to grab a bite the menu is creative you will absolutely find something that satisfies a craving even the unhealthy options taste a little more fresh because they don t overdo the salt still service was a bit slow and forgetful and the food really wasn t memorable but sometimes you don t need memorable you just need dinner
  i came here for some day drinking never bad idea in life right really came too support my friend heather at her new gig at northstar bar grill it tradition for all the years known her always stopped by whatever bar she working at over the years service always five stars on heather day shifts honestly she does great job not only because she friend but she makes you feel welcome never have worry about empty glass in your hand and she will always find way too brighten ones day talk about all the way out there for me i felt like drove too utah and back all for family once you get too northstar bar grill you would be surprise once you walk in the door at the core just local dive bar that all about the poker machines or multi games and then little section for the restaurant i been too lots of local dive bars in vegas over the years the thing that like about nortstar bar grill guess they recently renovated the interior it feels new not old run down they have couple pool tables lots of widescreen all on the inside of the bar bar rectangle all widescreen up top and bar in the middle and they can change one of the widescreen too your game not much seating it comes too the restaurant i just stopped by for day drinking so never looked at the menu i would think its your basic bar food nothing exotic but simple everyday sandwiches what not find at most other sports bar restaurant the next time visit heather make sure try some of the menu overall if the place was not on the other side of town or in another state i would hang out more often it has nice lay back feeling too the bar again like the new feeling every place i look at and not beat the service or the best bartender i know in vegas
  our friends reserved a vip space which happened to be the only vip space on the balcony in the center with 3 couches and a table while i felt a bit bad that others couldn t get the best view from the balcony i was very impressed with the atmosphere and service provided i would definitely recommend this space to others looking for a memorable night with friends the only issue i had was when we were trying to enter and gave our names at the door it took them 3 times to check the list before they finally found the names for a higher end place you d expect better service but one slip up on the night is understandable
  went here for brunch on sunday and feel in love great atmosphere great food great service i had the bloody mary flight which i found to be very original and interesting also had the small plate of short rib hash to die for very tender beef perfectly cooked potatoes really well tasty and just the right amount the buffet was also set up and they had a lot of variety all in all loved this place and will go back
  first off i love this kind of mexican food the kind that is covered in cheese and so unbelievably unhealthy that i shudder to think what the caloric content is i swear az has it s own brand of mexican food when i lived in l a there was no way i was finding a deep fried burrito covered in jalapeno cream cheese and then topped with more cheese or a mexican pizza with that same jalapeno cream cheese used as a sauce ajo al s does have lighter options and their salad carbon is favorite of mine as well but sometimes i just need to indulge you should know something else i worked here as a hostess when i was a senior in high school so i had the opportunity to try a ridiculous amount of ajo al s food i still love this place and always will if you re like me and you love the sonoran style food served in places like julio g s and valle luna you ll like ajo al s too you should also know that i don t understand when people say this type of food is not authentic authentic to what i sure can t find this crap in california new mexico or texas all of which border mexico so it must be authentic to arizona right and that is what i love good ol az mexican food
  fun atmosphere good music great beers on draft and delicious creative menu get the philly mac n cheesesteak sandwich
  my husband and i have been to guy kaku over the weekend and were impressed by the setting and decor of the whole place love the old warrior replicas it was our first time to visit we noticed the hostess and waiters were very friendly our server keiko was great the kobe beef and filet mignon were excellent i love the way they saute the edamame in garlic sauce i will definitely come back and will recommend this place to my friends and family
  chef cooking in the open facility mostly noodles pad thai noodles beef a most desirable appetite for the hungry man couldn t take this to heart
  always on point with the fajitas tortillas are always fresh and soft all around good food
  update even know id still give it a 3 5 upon eating around town a bit more and coming back to crisp i have to say it s on the higher end of 3 5 than the lower end id probably give crisp a 3 5 if 5 s were allowed crisp was good not great not bad consistent ill go back for sure but it is what it is a salad place i guess im struggling cause i feel a 3 star is low but a 4 i think is too high it is just really what it is an honest salad place it probably surpassed my expectations i know i will be back and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh quick bite to eat it s clean you get real silverware and real salt and pepper shakers all plusses in my book it was a little chilly but what ever thats as much the weather
  great food and an easy going environment i can t believe there aren t more fresh and healthy sandwich restaurants like this also i could eat a whole meal of just their cous cous off this place was a little easier to find and more noticeable when driving by i honestly believe there would be a line all day just to get it
  i had one of those wondrous discounts via deal chicken good thing i did with a 100 value didn t get much my daughter was still hungry and i was mildly full i loved what we ordered but my daughter did not cause she wasn t used to authentic japanese dishes sorry hun i m third generation japanese american she s fourth she loved the tuna sashimi therefore ordered two dishes of it i ordered the octopus which was cooked to perfection one would expect with the owner s reputation he would not overcook it therefore making it tough and chewy i ordered the soft shell crab i liked it cooked to perfection with just the right seasoning she wasn t used to seeing shrimp with heads another sorry hun that you were grossed out i ordered the crab salad it was good and thankfully she liked it as well would i go back i don t think so not at that price and for what we got but i can t argue that what we got was good
  worth the price for the atmosphere alone great steaks all the courses were wonderful petite filet oscar t bone best caesar salad ever prawns the size of a short man s hand toasted ravioli fantastic cheesecake very nice of staff to celebrate birthday for us a couple of loud mouth millennials without the capacity to follow unspoken rules of decorum should have been ejected lucky for them tony spilatro wasn t there other than that what a wonderful dining experience thank you golden steer for a wonderful night out in old school cool vegas
  went here for an early lunch i thought it was quite good my bf and i ordered sandwiches grilled chicken and a roast beef the grilled chicken was better than the roast beef the real star of the meal was the carrot salad it had this unexpected ginger flavor with some dried cranberries
  this is among the best sushi i ve had in phoenix we came in hungry and tried about half the menu it felt like all of the sushi was great the purple rice was interesting and i liked the texture the only dish i had that i thought was mediocre was the fried rice but the sushi was good enough to overlook that 1 slight hiccup downtown parking can at times be a problem but it is worth the trip we will be back in the next time we are downtown
  the lounge is a must see food is huge portions but really good did i say visit there lounge i love it drinks are enormous and sooo good
  ordered the sirloin steak and it was over cooked big time the server was awesome and had the kitchen try again on the second attempt it was a little less done but still over medium when ordered medium rare i don t suggest ordering any steaks when this place is very busy stick with pasta and seafood the service really saved the experience
  first time eating at this place they offer happy hour bonus the place look empty the waitress was nice the food is really fresh i had yellow tail sushi and that probably the freshest yellow tail i have had at a good price will come back next time after work before i pick up my kids i deserve some quiet time
  my wife i came here for the first time to celebrate after purchasing our new home the divine swine sandwich and fish chips entree were over the top some great beers too we had woodshed ipa mclovin irish red looking forward to trying more our server randy was prompt hilarious thanks again we ll be back soon
  it was great found my new favorite pho place the labour of the broth and the brisket is just too good
  i had the fun ghi burger medium with sweet potato fries it was so delicious i highly recommend coming here the burger was so juicy and the patty was seasoned perfectly service was quite slow though and we came here around 3 30p on a monday so there was literally like 3 tables at the time the waiter looked like he was a bit tipsy but hey it s vegas lol that was the only reason why i had to dock off 1 star
  i was on a groupon mission this weekend i came here with a friend to try out a new pizza spot after reading the previous reviews i was a lil worried about the pizza being undercooked sadly my pizza was a little burnt on the bottom if it wasn t this would have easily been a 4 star review we got the pizza to go as we were feeling lazy the bar was a dive bar and not as sketchy as i thought it was going to be the guys that worked the pizza spot were super nice the pizza was good we got a caesar salad and the dressing was amazing i d go back if was near by it s worth a try
  abuela s tacos has a simple and delicious menu everything is extremely fresh and delicious i love the asada fries and i make sure to get a meal there at least once a week delicious affordable and the owner is the nicest last that you can meet a great overall experience
  the atmosphere of relaxed welcoming effortless charm in l escargot blanc is one of those rare commodities that if bottled would sell in profuse amounts the food is rather good too it really is the ideal spot to spend a relaxing evening overall we said the elephant memoried among you will remember that i was not a fan of their sister restaurant l escargot bleu on my visit the reservations i had about bleu were not in evidence here and i thought blanc an absolute delight this is in no small measure down to the service which was beyond friendly and much like being invited in to the home of a treasured family member without question i ll be back to sample further dishes from their ever changing menu
  we were a party of two and visited muramoto despite the fact that we had been warned that they were slow a more accurate description would be glacial or non existent we arrived at 7 30pm on friday october 8 and were informed that the only seating available was at the sushi bar but that we would receive full service we did notice that several tables were completely empty but assumed that they were 7 30 patrons who were late or perhaps 8pm patrons who hadn t yet arrived the tables were still empty when we left sitting at the sushi bar sounded good to us we expected some interaction between ourselves and the chefs but apparently we had donned the cloak of invisibility as soon as we sat down the restaurant is one square room and we could see 4 servers gossiping and laughing not 15 feet away from us three servers were chatting at the front entry we continued to wait for someone to notice us without any luck finally one of us stood up and started to wave the 4 servers closest to us couldn t decide who should acknowledge the wave and discussed a possible response before one of them came over to us when we reported that we were ready to order the young woman who had come over responded i ll get you a server oh the clutch closest to us was apparently not the clutch assigned to our section my dining companion ordered the miso soup and sushi sampler while i ordered the salmon bowl both were good although the rice bowl should have been listed under appetizers rather than entrees we didn t see our server again until we distracted her from her little group of laughing servers and asked for our bill none of the servers should ever wonder why their tips are so small
  i ll start off by saying that i love their paint job inside yes it is nice and shimmery moving on to the food it is great i ve tried about a dozen things on their menu and have enjoyed everything it s hard to go wrong here the service is good as well
  i love greek food and took my mom and aunt there my mom has never had greek food decided on this place because my favorite place ambrosia closed and all the good reviews food was ok we had the dolmas good falafel good gyro meh and a combo with chicken very dry and kofta burned dry and tasteless the israeli salad on the combo was very good when we got our drinks we noticed a slimy liquid at the bottom overflow of the soda machine we hoped the top of the machine where the soda comes out was better it was not awful but there are a lot more places to choose from i will not go back
  i had the lamb chop medium very delicious and perfectly charred southwestern corn is probably the best thing on the menu i wish they shipped it great ambience perfect service and over the top mixed drinks the only downside bobby wasn t there
  apparently you can get kicked out for sleeping or looking like you re sleeping at the table so don t come when you re deathly hungover like we did we paid to skip the line because we would ve been charged dinner prices by the time we got to the front anyway still had to wait a bit but not as long as we would ve had to wait if we hadn t paid extra worth it love the atmosphere and presentation here the seafood is fantastic the food is pretty bite sized like wicked spoon which is awesome
  i have to agree with patrick here that this place has a great assortment of salads usually i would never think to order a salad but after a non impressive crab cake sandwich i think next time i will try what my mother ordered the bang bang shrimp salad it was absolutely phenomenal it definitely made the meal for all of us the lettuce wraps were passable but nothing special and my mother s bisque soup was complete broth it was terribly watered down when she said something to our waiter he did not even offer a reason or a suggestion to get her another soup he just said i will take that off your bill and tell the manager well the manager never came over to apologize or give a reason for the watery soup what really bummed me out was that the soup was what my mother had been bragging about and what she had been so excited for me to try maybe we will have to try again someday
  food is good and price is affordable all foods are fresh i love it
  great food you have to go to understand
  nom nom burger is the place to go for a burger that s asianized i know it s not an actual word but imagine your favorite bulgogi korean beef kimchi and use your american burger buns you get a nice meal food i got the korean bulgogi burger and it was delicious it was definitely messy so be prepared for lots of napkins loved their sweet potato fries as for drinks i ve ordered the taro milk tea and loved it it was not a slushy which some places make them that way the only disappointment is when they have hard or very chewy tapioca balls it s not fun to drink service when it gets busy your food will take awhile to get to you i saw other people who were definitely not trilled to wait around for the food and their checks our waiters and waitress who took care of us at different times were kind and attentive when you ask for their service
  this place needs a wake up call the service is very sloppy i had a reservation at 6 30 with family the table was good and ready but we didn t get a server to ask us what we wanted til 40 min later let alone we didn t start eating til a whole hour later the food is good but not worth the hassle plus it s really loud in there so we had to huddle together to even have a conversation
  i come to bars that are named after beer types or play puns on booze for one thing only beer the more the merrier as said by other reviewers saint bock is easy to walk by because neither its entrance nor its street front are flashy in any way shape or form you d be missing out le saint bock satisfies me wonderfully with their wide selection of microbrews enticing you through entertaining names and descriptions in languages that sound exotic to most non snobs never having had any of their food i wouldn t be able to comment i had the chance to regret not having any if you re at saint bock at 7 ish stay there and eat the decent eateries around the area have line ups stretching half a block until well past 8pm cheers or shall i say prost
  i love this place i ve been all times of day brunch lunch dinner always great get the table side guacamole avocado margarita is amazing as well
  the best italian food i ve had thus far my taste buds are giving each other high fives we enjoyed grayos seafood salad to start and for our multiple entrees chicken scciatta osso bucco and spaghetti with bolognese sauce portions fit the price for the best italian food i ve ever had the pleasure of tasting
  wowzers the hubby and i have been searching for a place like this for a long time awesome food great service good sized plates relaxing ambiance couldn t ask for more a little more pricier than the other place we went to but well worth it definitely found our new thai place
  overpriced and very small portions for what you pay and get my son had to order two sides of hash browns tastes o k not my favorite breakfast place
  ok let s face it no one enjoys giving a bad review but honestly the food was horrible the only thing that saved this experience from me ranting on about the food was the fact that the manager did come out to apologize and took my meal off hubby had a burger but it was very well done waitress must have been having too much fun with her work friends friends go to steak and shake next door
  on our first night getting into town my buddy and i were pretty exhausted and didn t feel like venturing out to find food on the strip so we swung by america after getting out stuff up in the room not really too much to look at typical diner style restaurant with a lot of american maps and ethos painted on the walls we came in pretty late when it was empty so we just slipped onto a couple of the bar stools at the front the beer selection is pretty standard but not expensive and the liquor selection is quite extensive i ordered your standard breakfast eggs bacons toast etc as a late night snack and it came out pretty much as you d expect in all a decent place to grab a bite within ny ny but nothing more than that
  service is terrible and the food isn t worth the price if you re going to serve brunch learn how to make a caesar and cook eggs in less that 30 mins especially when the restaurant only has 3 tables occupied i hate it when i see one server running around trying to do everything while the owner stands behind the bar watching tv close your business and sit in your livingroom
  brusco s does a great job of delivering very solid pizzas with a nice selection of italian dishes i ve eaten here three times and never been disappointed in either the food or service last time i took a brooklyn native with me who said it was a damn good pizza and especially liked the crust the service staff has always been very friendly and quick it should be noted the place opened up in june so a previous post complaining about the service should have taken into account the staff was still in a learning stage that being said i ve never had an issue with the service
  the best stromboli i ve ever had period i ve been going here for years and i can t get enough of the stromboli i think it s the dough that sets it apart from every other stromboli the best deal is when you get the stromboli with a wednesday lunch special for 7 99 you get a small stromboli french fries and a drink a small stromboli by itself is usually 9 49 so the lunch special is a steal
  this has been my go to place for years when i need a quick low cost non fast food meal i love this place
  still my favorite place in town for ayce another 5 star review 4 years later my last review was just about spicy tuna laaame lunch 21 95 and dinner 24 95 i have honestly never had a wait even on a friday or saturday evening so maybe i m lucky or maybe i come at irregular dinner hours 6pm isn t so irregular don t worry yourself over a wait as for feeling like a cramped sardine yes you will be jam packed into this place ask for a table on the new side to the right of the bar if it is open much more spacious here s how to do it at yama get a table yes a table i feel i get better and more efficient service at a table waiters have notepads so you can stack your orders while a chef only has his memory my water is always filled to the top sometimes i will ask them not to and don t get alcohol unless you want to compromise your stomach s capacity for food next step is nigiri you come to a sushi restaurant no cooked food here skip the boring appetizers 2 pieces come with one order if you re feeling it you can go for the seafood salad sashimi in a ponzu type sauce you get what i think is the left over cuts this is a hit or miss with me it s good but i definitely don t come here just for that what you must have is garlic tuna and the yellow tail after nigiri comes rolls number 7 sun of a beach is a must a must hits every sensation and taste hot cold crunchy sweet spicy yes its smothered in sauce which snobs seem to dislike but just get it i am also a big fan of wet dream its baked so it takes a little while for it to come out and has a healthy dosage of cream cheese keep note if you re feeling full but want to continue to try you can order a half roll and to top it off no matter how full you are dessert is a must mango or strawberry mochi will soothe the heat of your wasabi and creates a great end cap to the meal enjoy
  always delicious fast mexican food we have had a range of things that have always tasted fresh and very good flavors their rolled tacos are filled with a lot of meant rice and beans are really good authentic the green chile pork is a favorite as well but so is the red chile definitely give it a try if you re in the area you can eat there which is really spacious and clean or you can order the drive through which they re also pretty quick
  this is our new thai place i am a huge fan of the panang curry it is so rich and flavorful that it is hard to try anything else the stuffed chicken wings are the best we have tried and the papaya salad a refreshing surprise i love the environment and urban feel in downtown chandler
  really good chicken curry they also sell delicious flakey jamaican patties and a variety of ethnic drinks i recommend the pink ting which tastes like fresca but obviously better
  we hit this place on the way home from a party a typical lv party with plenty of booze and not so much as a potato chip to eat i was starving the staff was awesome super friendly the place feels like a fast food taco shop but the food was definitely better than that it is not the best taco place in the city but on the way home after a late night it was pretty f n great i would happily head back for another round of tacos made with love at tacos mexico
  we love love love viva mercado we followed bobby from the location on jones to the larger location on rainbow and were so disappointed when they closed we have eaten at the new location in village square many times and it never disappoints food drinks and service are always spot on tonight i had chicken fajitas and my husband had the tilapia and of course we each had a sauza margarita everything was delicioso we ve tried many other mexican restaurants and every time we ask ourselves why just stick with the best viva mercado
  the atmosphere at pomo is very cool laid back easy vibe bartenders are fun and chatty the misters outside are way to strong and over powering the prices are 3 4 too much very disappointed that kids meals don t include a drink so you pay an additional 1 50 for kids drinks my oldest daughter got pepperoni pizza but it was salami and under cooked my younger daughter ordered pasta and it was a small amount for 6 my husband and i ordered gluten free and sadly it was the worst gluten free pizza we have ever had the sauce the cheese and the toppings were great but the crust was not even editable extremely disappointed in the waiter for not asking how our meal was he took our plates away completely full and did not ask us what we thought thrilled that downtown gilbert is now a great place to hang out and eat sad that pomo isn t better
  come here for the rosa it s special like potentially waiting in line for the rest of your life special just look at the breakdown of this thing http eater com archives 2013 08 28 eater elements the rosa at pizzeria bianco php salty intense parmesan reggiano rosemary red onions and smokey pistachios are inconsistently but uniformly distributed over some damn good crust no sauce allowed for one hell of a taste bud roller coaster i know you want it you know you want it
  i have been to both ballantyne locations and i prefer this one the place is always clean and the employees are always attentive it is also not as crowded with corporate people as the community house location the bread was toasted to perfection and with just the right amount of ingredients my only complaint is that i find most of their sandwiches too salty for my taste particularly their meats but when i m hungry and short on time i would rather get a sandwich here than the other sandwich chains
  i was comped a couple tickets to see just the show only you have the option of ordering food which was 20 bucks per person originally i was just gonna watch the show but since i have never stepped foot in this place called kahunaville located inside the treasure island hotel and casino i was curious about the food they served here so i gave in and decided to share a meal with my wifey if you refer to the picture of the menu i took your meal starts off with bread macadamia white chocolate roll salad mixed greens provolone pineapple strawberries mandarin oranges tomatoes and pecans tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette topped with fresh shaved toasted coconut then you select a main entree we chose the ahi tuna pan seared yellow fin tuna served rare with wasabi mashed potatoes baby bok choy and a ginger soy reduction lastly you you get dessert we got a white chocolate covered cake pop drinks are extra the bread was basically a hawaiian sweet roll with raisins it seemed a bit dry based on the description of the salad you would think that they would give you a big bowl of it turns out that they only bit a tiny amount of each mentioned so when you actually dig into it there really isnt much substance to it i finished it pretty quick the main entree was very good the fish was encrusted with ground pepper and sliced into 6 thin pieces it was very tasty but seemed more like an appetizer lastly the cake pop for dessert was equivalent to two bites the white chocolate gave it good flavor service was weird the first thing that threw me off was that they had you share a table with complete strangers our table mates although they were nice seemed irritated that the teriyaki steaks that they ordered were both well done even though they wanted both to be medium rare our server was assigned several tables and at times was nowhere to be found the few times that she did show up it seemed like she was in a hurry to get our plates out of the way even though we were not done eating yet the worst part was that it took forever to get the check and by the time i got the receipt to sign half the people in the room were already gone plus on top of that a gratuity of 20 percent was already added to our total even though i was the only one that ordered i didnt think she deserved much of a tip let alone 20 percent as for the show it was mediocre at best starts out with some dude playing the guitar singing a couple of hawaiian songs while firing off one liners at the audience to see if anybody was actually paying attention then comes an elvis impersonator singing yup you guess it more hawaiian songs i have seen plenty of elvis impersonators in my lifetime this guy was not all that good eventually a couple of guys and 3 girls come out to start their luau dancing while another lady comes out as the lead singer does her thing this is what alternated pretty much for the 1 hour and 15 minute duration of the show in the end everything put together did not impress me much the entertainment was 3 stars the food and service that went along with it was 1 star one good thing to note is that their drummer music dj is the father of bruno mars if anything that is something worth mentioning so if you are planning on watching this show i recommend you eat somewhere else and just try to enjoy the show itself its not too bad but at the same time i have seen better come early to get good seats for its general admission yelp 2015 review 22 520 overall
  got the burnt tips which were awesome and the bacon wrapped jalapenos and lets be honest anything wrapped in bacon is delicious
  good food but 14 minutes in drive through at 830 with 4 employees to get a chx sandwich will go again though
  i love their purple rice for sushi rolls it s chewy but soft it s not too mushy either nothing s worst than mushy rice and not so good fish speaking of i ordered spicy salmon roll and spicy tuna roll in both rolls the fish were mashed up why please leave it in one piece literally so we can actually have the experience of eating when it s all mashed up the texture is like food that s been chewed up and spat out that should be the golden rule for any sushi restaurant don t convert fish into mashed potatoes lastly i got the seaweed salad mediocre verdict wouldn t be dying to go back but if i have to i would try something else
  pretty average i ve tasted better dogs at venice beach and many other places very easy access just next to the miracle mile shopping center and planet hollywood casino
  ordered the enchiladas hardly any chicken and very little flavor and for 16 service was spotty as well will not return very disappointing
  the combination of grilled cheese sandwiches beer and tomato soup isn t groundbreaking but the yard does it well strongly recommend the blarney stoner
  extraordinarily ordinary at here on a saturday late morning with wife and two kids first there was a wait for tables which is fine and frankly expected on the weekend at a small cafe but then they sat us and no waiter showed up once fixed service was really marginal for the rest of the meal food was just okay wife had the turkey burger which was just very boring and not exceptionally tasty i had the tryst omelet which was reasonably priced but very underwhelming in presentation and taste the sweet potato tater tots sounded cool looked cool and tasted pretty great for the first five or six in your mouth but there were a lot of plates i saw taken away with nearly full portions of the tots kids meals were just okay the kids burger had a patty that tasted worse than any mcdonalds or school lunch program burger i had in high school setting is an upscale strip mall inside is pleasant with outdoor tables and misters this would be a terrific late fall through early spring breakfast joint if you live in the area food isn t terrible as a whole better than a denny s but really nothing exceptional at all and the owners were nice and friendly but they need to teach their servers better manners and to spend less time flirting with co workers and more time focused on taking care of the customers i surely won t go out of my way to come back but if i had an hour to kill for breakfast and was in the area might give it another shot if nothing else looked better i mean not every place can be a matt s big breakfast or st francis or any of the other exceptional restaurants around town but the food service and atmosphere earns this place a solid 2 stars
  my wife and i ate here today and the food was amazing the service was great they serve chai tea and naan with the meal i m heading back soon thanks for a great meal
  last week i was craving the tuna salad sammy from pugzies it s cold and crisp and perfectly refreshing on a hot day especially when paired with the fruit salad check out my glorious lunch see pics complete with a cream cheese brownie which was much lighter and fluffier than a brownie more like cake if you ask me but still yummy this is by far one of the better sandwich shops check it out
  very good brick oven pizza this place would be much more amazing if it had a wine list and wait staff overall the pizza is great if you like brick oven pizza one of the best place to get a pizza in the west valley
  me oh my one of my favorite vegan spots i really wish there were one in ahwatukee too this shop has the most delicious everything i ve had the hot cocoa delish i also got one of the meat sandwiches and it was so good very filling i really like their cookies they are the perfect quick i m starving and need a snack but not junk pick me up i bought their iss mix which i ve already used for both pancakes and vegan burgers both turned out delicious and i ll be stopping back to pick up more when i run out one big thing that i love the owners are so nice it s a family ran business and i spoke to both owners the wife gave me a free cookie i believe the kids help run the place too but unsure great people great shop stop by you ll be happy you did
  first time there we got seated all the way to the back by the wine cellars so i was disappointed that we didn t get the ambiance of the restaurant the food was good that s a fact the service was very shallow the hostess were like drones even though we said it s our first time no reaction the waiter was ok he went through the motions if you are looking for a great food that s the place but it s not worth going back especially for a 300 dollar bill
  amazing food and amazing service what more can you ask for i went here last night to celebrate a birthday for my girlfriend and was seated immediately since the rush hasn t started yet the restaurant seemed like the perfect place for our date that evening romantic and classy exactly what i was looking for our waiters took our drinks and told us a long list of specials they for the night that speech took at least 3 minutes i guess they were really trying to push the specials before i get onto the food i want to comment on the service and overall experience service fantastic we were checked up on my our waiter and his trainee many times throughout dinner usually restaurants check up on you 2 3 times throughout the dinner and we would have to flag them down the rest but not here another thing that caught my attention was the owner walked around mingling with the customers the entire night he looked content and caring you have to wait for your food here each of our courses had at least 15 20 minutes in between including the time you eat that course as it should be we ordered around 6 40pm received our antipasto at 6 50 then received our mussels at 7 20 and so on i m not saying this is bad at all but if you re in a hurry don t eat here they make quality food here and if you re just going to rush through and scarf it down you mine as well just grab a burger from wendy s down the street experience i really enjoyed that dinner the food was fantastic and not too salty i actually prefer this place over maggiano at the fashion show mall it seems like real italian food not the fancy dishes they serve you at the high quality italian restaurants at mgm casino or the americanized italian food at maggiano or buca di beppo this restaurant pulls quality and authentic italian style cooking stirs it up and serves it onto a plate for you to indulge in also go to restaurant com to get a coupon my four course meal for two people was 121 but my coupon was for 50 off 100 so the bill was for 70 not including an automatic 18 gratuity for using the coupon so all together 90 for a four course high quality meal not bad not bad at all food appetizers carpaccio di manzo con argula e parxnigiano beef carpaccio and arugala with parmesan cheese shavings 15 i actually really liked this carpaccio when comparing it to many of the other places in las vegas at brio in town square they use an aioli which i m not too fond of i really like the taste of the beef and the extra aioli hides that flavor however the carpaccio is not as good as the one at fiamma at the mgm casino their secret ingredient is truffles so they automatically have the upper hand insalatta della casa house salad 9 a basic house salad with a nice sweet balsamic vinaigrette hot appetizers brodetto clams and mussels in a white wine tomato broth 15 this smelled and tasted great however the bread was supposed to be dipped into the broth and eaten but the broth was too salty to consume with the toast i don t think i ll order this one again main course mezzelune di vitello con porcini a half moon type of ravioli filled with veal 19 this tasted fantastic it takes the cake from all other italian restaurants i ve been too the cream sauce was not too salty the filling was nice and smooth and the extra peas and prosciutto added a nice flavor to every bite ossobucco alla millanese braised veal shank on saffron risotto 32 this was my first time i had ossobucco and to be honest i only got it because it was basically the most expensive item on the menu and i wanted to be able to use my 50 off 100 coupon i don t regret getting this dish at all the veal fell apart when i dug into it with my fork a good sign that it was braised for a while and the saffron risotto was nice and creamy dessert tiramisu my girlfriend and i weren t really a fan for this one the tiramisu at maggino seemed better the only upsetting part about this cake was the lady fingers despite them being soaked with liquid it still felt kind of dry and rough when swallowed maybe i m just used to eating the one at maggiano and i don t know what real tiramisu should be like gaetano s specialty martini 9 i didn t really like it the texture was nice bubbly and still had some floating crystals of ice but there was a similar remarkable scent from one of those discs that they put in the urinals so that it doesn t smell i couldn t get past that also it could have been sweeter that pretty much wraps it up i would definitely go here again as it s probably my top italian restaurant now
  oh man this place definitely surprised me i went in as a blank slate imagining it to be something like jamba juice no such thing though this place is a legit solid restaurant light unassuming flexible and subtle is how i d describe it the food service and interior and overall experience were all top notch and i can t imagine how they could be improved not too hard on the ol wallet either all of which adds up to 5 stars in my book their desserts looked stupendous and reasonably priced too in addition to that the atmosphere they strike the balance between trendy classy and casual so well and that s the thing i mean when i say flexible you see families dates bar flies even a kid s birthday and none of it looked out of place or imbalanced the setting in the slightest well done pita jungle
  mahi mahi was delicious served with lemon sauce artichokes sundried tomatoes grilled asparagus on the side a nice meal bread was fresh and good blooming onion was tasty but way too greasy resulted in upset stomache
  first time here wonderful service and food we sat in the bar area and the bartender was fantastic and running her tail off she was nice super service and happy very refreshing my steak did come out over cooked but the manager had them cook another one immediately and it was melt in my mouth perfect highly recommend this place and we will be back
  absolutely great service so friendly amazing food they did mess my food up recently i called and the manager said she was so sorry and took my name down and said she would take care of me next time next time i are my whole meal was free awesome place
  i really enjoyed my lunch here great salads great sandwiches and a very good drink bar selection it is a nice bonus that they served breakfast all day on the weekends too
  huge portions and an even bigger waste of my time and money myself and nine other were looking forward to a family style italian lunch things started off great and then took a nose dive after the salad course two pasta dishes and a chicken entree took about 40 minutes to come out one of the pasta dishes was wrong and had to be redone took another 30 minutes we thought we had ordered the chicken saltimbocca but couldn t find the prosciutto after asking our server about it he assured us it was there we just couldn t see it i ll tell you what i couldn t taste it either carmines ended up being a disappointment at least there was a decent gelato stand down the way
  fried rice here tasted like steam rice while the beef taste so old however the panang curry and tom yum soup got them 3 stars overall rating
  part of our problem having dinner here was that we bought a groupon 3 course meal for two there was no fine print to tell us that the huge menu here mentioned by many other reviewers becomes strictly limited for groupon customers i ve stopped buying groupons entrees were salmon or chicken or filet mignon the shared appetizer list was equally short diners next to us could choose carpaccio amongst other things we could get mussels or shrimp in garlic sauce or some kind of pepper with cheese in it the shrimp in garlic was overcooked not very tasty dry we had the steak ordered it medium rare it came medium well to well done in parts i pointed this out to the waiter saying i just want to have somebody agree with me that this is not medium rare it is not he agreed and offered me another no i said i don t waste food i just want somebody to see what i see and point it out to the boss and the chef in the hopes that things will improve we saw him speaking to the patron who ultimately brought back our credit card and receipt at the end of the meal he thanked us for visiting his restaurant and that was it so i said apparently your chef doesn t know the difference between medium rare and medium well patron expressed his surprise with a very sorrowful face and asked so your s was not done right now that was the main thing if that was the first he had heard of it he could have made some kind of response offered some kind of comp anything i wouldn t have taken it but would have liked a better response since we were convinced our waiter had told him his response seemed disingenuous at best if he did know already he was willing to let the waiter carry the can if he did know he didn t care enough to own up food sub par service from the waiter good management to be avoided like groupons easy enough to find a better restaurant in pittsburgh and this one deserves a big avoid if management won t see what is in front of their eyes how can you trust them to prepare your food
  i visited mesa from southern ca about a month ago and was pleased to discover this gem my first night in town and i made a point of visiting every day of my trip if i lived in mesa or anywhere near it i would be here every day the coffee is excellent they have an organic colombian a good selection of veggie friendly foods wi fi a large outdoor patio and there is an extremely reasonably priced yoga studio on the premises which i visited for one of their intro classes and removed the kinks of several days of driving from my back the owner is a total sweetheart and the employees and everyone else i ran into there are friendly they just don t make them like this anymore
  great food but the place is freezing cold and no one seems to be able to change the temperature nice waitresses and waiters too presentation can be improved particularly on salads stop taking a small piece of salmon and cutting it in thirds clean the window ledges when you clean the tables don t just toss debris on the ledges
  the food is just okay never horrible but never all that great it is a fun place for a group but it is a tad gimmicky if you ask me
  the wait is already long so understaff its so chaotic no one is really running this place orders are taken after sitting for 30 mins to the owner please this is america why not come and help your business thrive we are trying to help out filipino businesses but too bad we aint coming back
  horrible placed a to go order was quoted 35 mins got there and waited another 20 mins and all they said sorry your order isn t ready really poor service didn t realize they were so famous good the can afford this level of poor service
  this place is amazing their garlic knots are so delicious the pizza is pretty good the service is good i can t complain
  oooh yeah bad daddy wait a second this isn t the start of alex l s erotica writings lucky you apparently this is a newish chain of restaurants throughout nc sc and denver i was lucky enough to run into it during a transfer at the charlotte douglas airport i needed an excuse to eat like a bad daddy this is killing me and lucky for me it was cheeseburger day i needed to seduce my wife who is a pescetarian to indulge in a burger with me even the strictest pescetarian auto correct wants to make this proletariat which would also be an accurate statement can t resist bad daddy s allure of a juicy burger and she proved to be no exception ok just don t tell the whole internet so we sat down were handed a menu and both of us ironically fixated upon the vegetarian option which looked most appealing it was a black bean burger with avocado onions and some jalapenos i asked our server about it and he suggested subbing the black bean veggie patty with a juicy meaty burger my kind of guy so i did and asked for it to be cooked medium he warned me that it would still be pink in the middle which was purrrrfect my wife stuck with the vegetarian option but made me promise to let her take a bite of mine no problemo i loved the fact that the burger came with a choice of fries tater tots or coleslaw i went with the tots the burgers came out within 5 10 minutes which is impressive since it was a pretty full bar restaurant but i guess they gotta keep it speedy at the airport i loved it the bread was high quality fluffy and the burger was cooked perfectly medium which many restaurants seem to fail at it was served with a side of sauce tomatoes onions cheese and lettuce with avocado and onions on the base of it the flavors came together wonderfully and the meat was seasoned very well my wife and i exchanged bites and i loved her vegetarian patty and she seemed to enjoy the sinful delicious bite of my burger breaking her normally pescetarian diet you re not going to tell the whole internet right honey this will be our little secret we exchanged a sultry look while continuing to chow down the tater tots were fantasimal as well crispy crunchy and delicious her coleslaw tasted fresh and healthy entertainment was plentiful as a burner sat down a few tables away from us and attempted to engage in conversation with the beautiful single girl who was sitting at a table next to us he was trying to impress said girl with his burning man adventures and we listened with glee placing bets on whether or not he would try to get her at the end of the conversation he gave her a business card instead final verdict delicious burgers at an airport prices are very reasonable for the airport 10 12 a burger you can substitute kobe beef for an extra 5 if you want i suggest getting the black bean burger but subbing the black bean patty with a juicy meaty patty
  me and my husband had a late dinner for the first time a few days ago the restaurant was pretty empty except for a few tables on patio first it took 25 30 minutes for our waiter to acknowledge we were there then it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks we finally had to talk to hostess to see if we could get some service our waiter finally arrived with our drinks no apologies or acknowledgement that he was taking unusually long we finally ordered our food and it was not great the steak we ordered was cold i asked for rare but it was cold and barely cooked the mash potatoes were rubbery and gummy like they had been sitting all day and over mixed i didn t even finish my food if you need to get a late night dinner go somewhere else between the service and food we won t ever be going back
  i m a taco bell freak this location is always really fast even with as busy as it usually is i ve never had one bad experience at this location in 8 years viva taco bell behind target greatland
  i can t actually rate the food because we left before it got that far drinks and service were horriable not to mention the fact that it was like 100 degrees in there ohh and they seem to have worked very hard in the design to fit the absolute max amount of people per square foot with zero regard for comfort there are tables jammed into every possible space
  oh man love their sangria some of the best in town and their dessert ain t to shabby either and love the people watching
  i like the charm of this particular macayos it is dated but i m pretty sure all the macayos are it s part of their own history and adds a lot to their uniqueness this restaurant is huge inside and outside i was really surprised at how big it was haha on our dinner stop the restaurant was pretty empty which was great because we were starving and had already drove all the way up from tempe the hostess seated us upon walking in and our server was very prompt as well she was nice and very knowledgable of the menu after looking at the menu i got the enchiladas and refried beans well that was after i devoured the chips salsa we put our order in and our food came out in about 10 minutes maybe even quicker and then i finished my food in maybe 5 minutes haha i was so hungry one of the managers brought our food out and she was very very nice overall it was a nice meal and nice ambience i kept looking at the bar and thinking how drab but i m sure their happy hour prices make up for it
  for clean eating i love coming to true food s it s a open friendly atmosphere with a ton of healthy eating options that are flavorful and tasty their salad staple is the tuscan kale salad which is full of crisp kale greens sprinkled with parmesean cheese and a lemon spiced dressing really fresh tasting and super delicious my other favorite salad when it s in season is the roasted vegetable ingredient salad roasted veggies think califlower squash brussel sprouts pomegranate seeds and mulberry with a horseradish dressing it is absolutely superb my only issue with it was that for some reason this time the salad was about half the size it used to be i mean i don t normally eat a ton but this was so tiny that i was still pretty hungry after not sure if they changed the portion size or if they were running out of ingredients but for 12 i expect to be satiated overall i love the quality of the ingredients at true foods and will definitely be coming back to get my healthy eating on
  i ve had honey bears twice both times i got the pulled pork sandwich i can t give the sandwich a passing grade these were from two different locations and the same result the meat was unseasoned and bland although juicy and tender enough the bun sauce is uneventful and for 5 bucks i want better the first time i got a sandwich it was bought to me from the tempe location the 2nd time i went to the central location the service was non descript which i guess isn t a bad thing the place looked nice though neat and clean and there were a lot of people eating so the stuff is good to someone just not me i figure if you can t get a pulled pork sandwich right i d be an idiot to try your ribs or chicken so i guess honey bears is on my nope list too bad cause its so convient from work i will however go back and try their catfish if they get that right i ll throw another star at them
  the place is really good but i find it a bit pricy compared to some other thai places the food options are good and my personal favorite is the hell curry if you like spicy food like me this is the one to get you can get it with any kind of meat you want
  came here for lunch the other day with a couple friends and had an okay experience the interior is definitely a highlight very cool and trendy a friend and i shared the ahi tuna tacos and the cluck and moo lunch special chicken breast ribs and fries the chicken and ribs were quite good and the fries were really unique super thin fries the tacos however were quite disappointing for 20 i was expecting something a bit more memorable the portions were quite small and the taste was average tuna lacked taste and didn t pack much of an impression only thing i found impressive was the presentation the service was decent and the food was average overall it was an okay experience but it s not somewhere i would visit consistently
  no consistency and chances are your order will be incorrect 8 01 15 online pickup order of 4 subs they forgot to bag one of my sandwiches got all the way home before they called me to come back they forgot to put turkey on classic sub 13 which comes standard with pastrami and turkey probably the worst part was the lettuce all core pieces that were browned disgusting 6 2015 online pickup order 3 out of 5 sandwiches were incorrect to some degree wrong bread or cheese or vegetables i was told the online payment total was short and asked to pay a couple dollars more when i picked up the order veggies were not fresh and they included the end of tomatoes and fragments of other foods that didn t belong like onions yuck even though i took time to type names for each sandwich when ordering online both times the employees at this location never write anything to identify the individual subs always seems like the employees don t care about quality next time i will drive to another location and avoid this one by smiths on n durango
  i really love this place the owners are a nice family the food is deli sh i have a few favorites here the pad see ew is fantastic if you want your dish to be served spicy or mild me they can provide their soup is the best i ve had anywhere very affordable and a great service and nice looking atmosphere p s the guy from arkansas that just not only obliterated every aspect f this restaurant but also made a vague accusation about the legitimacy of the restaurant and then insinuated that we reviews are ghost writers and not actual patrons let me say this i have lived in the neighborhood of this restaurant since 1985 it used to be a mexican restaurant that closed years ago these owners have renovated and restored this place to make a great place to be an day of the week the servers are the nicest and most helpful servers anywhere and finally this is arizona it s dusty its like going to the beach and complaining that it s sandy obviously you are completely entitled to you complete opinion in a review website but the accusations are ridiculous stick to the food atmosphere service i noticed both of your total 2 reviews are scathing
  under 475 calories for each dish that is amazing it just proves that you can have phenomenal simple yet healthy food and still feel full we shared the yellow beet salad delicious and the ravioli app again delicious then for my entree i had the trout it was so smooth and tender i can t believe they didn t use an ounce of butter to cook it the asparagus and carrots were expertly al dente i think that s how you spell it my girls scallop dish was just as delicious seared and tender just perfectly we absolutely couldn t leave without trying a mini desert dish the pecan pie was heavenly in every scoop as was a shared key lime pie a great restaurant it s too bad it s a little on the pricey side what would be great is to have a place like this so more people could see what good healthy food can be overall best restaurant food i ve had in a long time
  not sure if we came on an off day but we were all utterly dissapointed with our first time at hash house a go go was really looking forward to trying this place on our last day i thought our party of 5 would have to wait forever on sunday at noon but surprisingly we were seated in less than 15 minutes first off it was like a sauna at the quad and upstairs at hash house a go go not a good experience to start off with and the hostess was a bit rude saying everyone must be present to be seated understood we were seated in a cozy booth towards the back and luckily it wasn t as hot back there our waiter took our drink orders and 2 of us ordered their famous kiwi watermelon lemonade one ordered a coffee and he brought a total of 2 waters for 5 of us even though others wanted water the fruity lemonade was refreshing and not overly sweet they serve it with boba straws my friend and i decided to share the famous fried chicken benedict as a benny fan i was really excited to try this man vs food staple another ordered the salmon benedict a salmon hash and the fried chicken and waffles food came out pretty quickly and the portions are humongous i was so glad someone agreed to share with me overall the dish was okay nothing out of this world the best part was the biscuit friend s smoked salmon benedict was actually cooked some overly cooked and dry when she mentioned to the waiter that it wasn t smoked salmon as it said he got really defensive and said it is smoked but when they cook it as a benedict it cooks that way friends hash had very badly burnt potatoes and he agreed that the biscuit was the best part felt bad for the friend that got the fried chicken and waffles he said the chicken had no flavor and very dry the waffles had a strip of bacon in the middle but i think it would be tastier if they crumbled the bacon and put in the batter overall i would try again but maybe a different location i
  i get the spinach and chicken salad here about once a week it is very good and if i don t add a ton of dressing it is also pretty healthy additionally it is a large enough portion that i am able to save some for later at about 9 it s somewhat expensive for a salad and a drink but the healthier options usually are
  appetizers were big in size but small in flavor chicken wings not seasoned well pork belly not seasoned well just tasted like pork the entrees redeemed you had the wet baby backs and dry rubbed st louis so juicy and flavorful some of the best ribs in town and the sides held up to the main event mac n cheese was creamy and cheesy but not over sauced the candied yams were great and the hint of citrus in the marshmallow meringue is genius takes them to the next level look out lucille s there s a new smoker in town square
  having tried wah kee fugu ichiban dumplinghaus and a few other chinese restaurants in the area i ll say that orient house is easily the best of them all so far they have authentic dishes ranging from sichuan to shanghai and they also have americanized dishes on top of that their pork buns dumplings are the best around they have xiao long bao and sheng jian bao pan fried shanghai style buns which no one else has on the weekends they also do a traditional chinese breakfast offerings if you enjoy that type of thing not so much for me but they do have some dim sum offerings that are pretty tasty prices are pretty reasonable less than ichiban or fugu but more than a take out american style chinese dive friendly and efficient service this place has the best chinese food madison has to offer
  went here with a few friends for dinner today i had never been here before and i m almost positive i wouldn t have ventured in here on my own i m glad my buddies dragged me in here the food is good you are given a bowl when you are seated and you get to choose the meats veggies spices and sauce for your stir fry so basically if you don t like what you made its your own dang fault they have recipes up on the walls if you are super lost i didn t realize that the meat would shrink once it was cooked i obviously don t cook often so i probably could have gotten more my advice is to stock as much as possible in your bowl they have happy hour daily i believe bud light drafts are almost always 2 can t complain about that the bowls are typically around 10 each so you can get a decent sized meal for like 15 they also have frequent eater cards once you buy seven you get a bowl free and you also get a free bowl for your birthday my friends knew once of the servers so we were given exceptional service i am looking forward to eating here again
  echoing a lot of other reviews it s definitely a bit overrated and the wait can be insane even with a reservation i can t imagine trying without one but it s still a fun and memorable experience with pretty good pizza and wine if you go i definitely recommend going with a group of 8 10 people and making a reservation well in advance i ve never been for lunch but i ve heard that it s more feasible for that there s a nice beer and wine bar next door which i assume strategically at least doesn t mind that people are waiting a long time to be seated as long as you go with a good group of people and consider the waiting to be part of the experience i don t think you ll be disappointed the biggest shame for me is that they don t have patio seating in phoenix it s nice enough for that almost year round that said it s a beautiful and central location and if you go when it s a bit chilly out by phoenix standards you probably won t mind eating inside i can t bring myself to give it an overwhelmingly positive review mainly because they re so overrated but i can say that other than the waiting which is part of the experience if you re with the right people and not in a rush i ve never been disappointed or had a bad time there definitely recommend trying it out at least once
  i can t believe i ve never reviewed this place i ll try to fit in all i can muster about my favorite china town area restaurant my mom s thai and a really good home cook but since we re all grown now she doesn t make huge family style meals anymore so this is my go to thai restaurant it s not fancy it s not over priced it s not a new take on thai it s pretty much the classics done simply and executed well plus the price is definitely right i m pretty sure nothing is over 10 i think well maybe if you do seafood it might be my favorites are definitely the same as most yelpers noodle house style pot stickers are always a good start noodle house tom yum soup with choice of noodles which i get the fat noodles spice a 10 my favorites include roasted duck curry 75 of the time duck fried rice ask for chili in it and it makes it even better the roasted duck soup with egg noodles fried chicken over fried rice bbq park and chinese sausage fried rice lad nah grilled beef salad with a side of sticky rice their version of pho lol tom kah kai and pretty much everything on their menu it s all really good my only let down was the pork wonton soup i got tonight with egg noodles fresh but a pretty bland broth a huge plus is they can make their papaya salad laos style which i prefer and it s actually really good with ling ling as the best server ever and down to the padak on the table as a condiment this place is pretty authentic and never disappoints me idk if this is for regulars but the service is always super sweet if i don t finish something for any reason i e being full or saving for later the ling ling always asks if i enjoyed it or if i need it replaced if i may not have liked it so nice it s tiny so expect a tiny wait at times the food is worth it and try not to sit in that center table when it s sunny random thought my favorite thing about eating a thai meal is that it s usually family style i wish they had an options of ordering a bowl or pot of some of the dishes if that makes any sense but i m sure there s a reason they dont offer that limited table space
  the amazing part about terminal 4 in sky harbor is you get a great sample of the local phx flavor instead of your everyday mcdonald s jamba juice etc commonplace in us airports i m a card carrying verified los taquitos addict and know they ve been here for a while decided to grab a bite on my way out to albuquerque this afternoon to see how it compared to their ahwatukee and phoenix locations if you re going to take anything way from my review let it be this this location is absolutely nothing like the flagship if you don t count the food truck locations sure the menu looks almost identical breakfast burritos and tortas the infamous street tacos and quesadillas the food even looks the same yes i realize this is airport food but the only thing from a quality control standpoint that tastes the same are the roja y verde salsas i went with the 3 street tacos combo and a large water bottle for a total of 12 13 the tortillas were sad and cold the beans were playdoh esque cold and the rice had way way way too much seasoning all of the meats were lukewarm the pollo was dry and crumbly the carne asada lacked that vibrant spice we all know lt by and the carnitas were also missing that unique spice i will say though the carnitas was the most moist of the three sad wilted cilantro and onions were scattered on haphazardly what a disappointment this is one of my favorite taco places in town and it s a shame they re misrepresenting their product here this would have been a one star review if we re going off food quality only however the team was really hustling the gal was taking orders was cheery and the manager took time to chat with me come on los taquitos family take a look at quality control i know y all are worlds better than this
  i m normally not a big bbq fan and i m not a big meat eater but on a rare occasion i ve had a good bbq brisket sandwich or pulled pork i looked at their website and the prices seemed good and i loved the side dishes so i figured i d give this place a try today for lunch and wow i m glad i did i thought this place was gonna have a walk up counter to order from and then sit down wherever you want like any other fast casual place but i walked in and to my surprise it s a regular full service restaurant with a host and wait staff the host pointed out today s special and when the server came over she was pleasant but that was really about it she wasn t rude or anything at all but i mentioned i needed a little time to look over the menu because it was my first time here and that would be kind of a hint to her to suggest something really good or maybe tell me about the 5 bottles of sauces on my table i ordered the brisket basket with the mac n cheese and the baked beans all i can say is yum yum yum my food wasn t drenched in bbq sauce which is perfect for me i don t mind some sauce just not a ton the cornbread muffin was great so was the juicy corn cob i loved the 2 sides i picked the mac n cheese had a little spicyness to it and the beans were flavorful the brisket was very tender and i even tried the mustard sauce they had on the table and that was the perfect complement to the meat i would definitely come back again the only small drawback was when i was finished i waited almost 5 7 minutes for my server to come by and bring me my check she was no where to be seen anywhere in the dining room i saw 4 other servers constantly walking around and taking care of their guests but my server was m i a as a restaurant manager i technically hold the other servers accountable as well because no one else came by to check on me i always talk to my service team about always look around the dining room and help any guest in need and provide table attentiveness this did not happen here but the food was great and i will definitely go back
  i have been here three more times since they have opened and i have experienced much better service and the food quality has improved greatly i love their cocktails the menu is pretty dairy heavy but they accommodating for food allergies great place overall i am happy i tried them out again
  this buffalo wild wings has the worse customer service i have been to other locations and never experienced this bad of customer service anywhere else our waitress only came to take our order and never came back to see if our orders were correct or refill our drinks the guy that dropped our food off said he was coming back with more ranch and never did we never received boats for the bones from our wings so resorted to putting them on the table when we had asked someone else to assist is she rolled her eyes and with attitude asked if there was anything else we needed i would go to any other location except this one
  i really wanted this place to be good it was close and i did not want to drive all the way to spring mountain for some vietnamese food sadly i still have to drive there to get some good food maybe it was a bad night maybe it was because i came in a half and hour before they were closed but i ordered the pork meatball spring rolls and the rice noodles with grilled pork when i went home and opened up my to go boxes the rice noodles were actually shrimp instead i was pretty sad about that the rolls were alright and thats why they get another star but there was alot of filler mostly just shredded lettuce the rice noodle dish was the one that turned me down on the place the grilled shrimp were over cooked the noodles were hard and under cooked there was mostly lettuce and the sauce was very watered down i will give it a second chance but i will proceed with caution
  pies pies pies are the only reason i come here i stopped dining at the infamous mc quite some time ago after a bad meal experience their desserts are the only saving grace because the food is overpriced for salty and skimpy meal portions the decatur street location closed so now i drive over to the remaining sahara location to pick up pies for special occasions their food has gone downhill way downhill to the point of no return i miss the mc of the 1980 s and early 90 s when they had delicious food
  we requested a quieter table and were seated in a quiet corner we had the caesar salad emeril s barbecued atlantic salmon cedar camp fire plank steak and emeril s banana cream pie everything was wonderful from the excellent service to the mouth watering food the steak melted in your mouth and was perfectly cooked emeril s banana cream pie was filled with big chunks of bananas and wasn t overly sweet but it was huge overall a wonderful dining experience
  let me start off by saying i had just come from new orleans and these guys are doing it right i got the hot and juicy special sauce in medium spicy and extra spicy yes i ate 3 pounds of crawfish don t judge they re delicious
  i ve wanted to get a burger from henry s since i read the burger edition of the weekly yelp i liked this place the moment i walked in the low light decor and bar area reminded me of a bar in washington where i went to college our waitress shelly was very good and she had a good sense of humor i love banter with a waitress my wife s 7 up came with a half pitcher refill that was set on the table the half pound cheeseburger was a steal at 4 99 it was big delicious and very filling they have specialty burgers for 8 99 that all looked pretty great and come with a side the cheaper burger doesn t come with a side but fries are only 2 50 the onion rings and fries were great my wife had the reuben and while it was very tasty the meat could have been sliced a bit thinner beers were cheap at 3 75 for domestic but i think this place really needs to have a happy hour if they did i would come here a couple fridays a month being a teacher is stressful i would chalk this one up to about 3 and 1 2 stars but i liked it so much i m goin to round up
  the owner makes best crepes in town and the menu has so many different options savory and sweet i definitely recommend this crepe place it s always fresh and delicious
  vastly overpriced so so food service is ok but not spectacular not a good experience steak overcooked and sent back
  i had high hopes for this place i gave it a shot after getting a deal on living social and was disappointed the bagels are not bagels they have a bready and airy texture that of a bagel you would find at say vons there is no dense chew that you expect when biting into a real bagel not only this my order was wrong and when we asked to dine in they brought us a to go container i m sorry to say but i don t see this place lasting much longer they are blatantly overstaffed and while the owner was taking our order he had to stop twice to explain to the cook behind the counter how to read the order slip of previous orders with that said the people working were very nice and the establishment looked very clean and well kept please avoid this place the bagels are literally bread they look impressive from the case large fat and enticing but don t be surprised when you bite into a dry bready bagel save your money and go to bagel mania on twain and swenson the bagels are infinitely better and true new york style i would know i m a new york native
  i was in charlotte last month for a retreat and was really looking forward to all the places the ladies had picked as they looked delicious on their menu online after traveling all day on friday the first day there i was super hungry and super tired a big group of us walked over from the doubletree and as i oohed and aahed at the city i ve never been to before i got to the black finn and was like umm this is it the menu seemed pretty expansive and i didn t want to take forever to order so i played it safe and ordered a club sandwich on the croissant wow was i ever disappointed it was cold and nasty and honestly after a day of all day travel from ca to nc i wasnt in the mood to complain so i ate half of my sandwich and left the rest there the only reason i am giving this place three stars is because of its exceptional customer service they gave our group free appetizers and because of their amazing pineapple upside down cake martini
  i have only been here for happy hour but their happy hours is very good they have draft beer and there are a variety of appetizers on the happy hour menu for cheap that are all very tasty it is a comfortable place to eat open high ceilings nice decor and the staff has always been very friendly
  good food good tea good service
  love this place food has always been excellent and it s a great place for a date because the atmosphere is cozy and trendy make sure to get reservations on the weekend because it is very tiny and fills up quickly
  love this place veteran of the munich october fest went to school in wisconsin german settled if you don t know this isn t close but brings back great memories stopped in to check it out ended up staying for just a couple of beers liter each had a great time the sausage tower was great loved the beer pretzel mustard and atmosphere munich in vegas great fun not high btow just enjoy the beer get a shot of schnapps that will kick your ass fun and i ll come back for sure
  little cramped seating for four but the food makes up for any seating issue
  alright so my sister and i were bored and wanted to get out of the house and get some drinks we usually go to our regular locals bar club car which has the best bartender in the world regina but she is not there on fridays so we thought we would go to michaels pub we had a blast this place is awesome as awesome as a local dive bar can get lol we each ordered a long island and were impressed how strong they were and ordered a second we were buzzin a lil just off of those two drinks and trust me we are not light weights so they do make some pretty great drinks then we met a group of guys that are regulars and they bought us these shots of chocolate cake now i am so not a fan of fruity or sweet drinks but because of how strong the great bartender made the shots i enjoyed them this is a locals bar so don t expect any thrills but the locals and regulars that come here are very friendly and the bar tenders are pretty awesome i will definitely be returning here
  an exceptional experience ambiance can simply not be beat surrounded by 50 million dollars worth of picasso originals elegantly appointed space and a clear view of the bellagio s famous fountain and light show you can choose from two menus the prix fixe which is three courses i believe for 105 per person or you can choose the 5 course tasting menu both fi and i chose the tasting menu and after perusing the encyclopedia sized wine list decided to go with the wine pairing since there are so many reviews i m just going to go over the hi lights 1 foie gras and sauteed peaches paired with a deliciously sweet hungarian wine to balance the richness of the fg i ve usually had fg in something or as a spread this was a generously portioned piece straight up presentation was outstanding 2 scallop on whipped potatoes with veal reduction i would have thought that the veal reduction would have overpowered the scallop not so scallop was perfectly caramelized and the potatoes melted in your mouth 3 dessert vanilla bean crepes with cream cheese gelato presented as crepe purses ties with cocoa bean over raspberry puree with a chocolate hoop giving the dish a 3d look 4 sommelier and general service sommelier personally explained each wine pairing answered all questions and selected a diverse and balanced collection to accompany our dishes bravo service was attentive and upscale without being intrusive or arrogant i will say that there was only one small issue that we had there was a lot of lag time between the amuse bouche and our first course almost an hour the waiter even brought us a book about the restaurant to pass the time this was both odd and amusing once the courses started however all was well
  i ll give this place 5 stars i dig the decor it s very colorful and cozy lots of artwork on the walls and bright colors its small and i heard its crazy during lunch hour etc with lines going outside the door the menu is pretty simple healthy or happy side i wanted to try everything but i ordered smoke in a bowl it was really good and healthy my company ordered drunken gypsy toast i m ordering that next time i go there this isn t a cheap place but you pay for what you get the portions could be for 2 people its a lot of food so it s worth it it s pretty cold in the restaurant and that would be the only downfall that i ve noticed the staff is really friendly and helpful i will definitely recommend this spot to my friends and i ll be returning over and over again
  i really had high hopes for this restaurant i arrived for lunch during the week and was impressed with the ambience but wondered where everyone was there were literally 5 other people eating food i decided i would stick to the pizza margherita at 12 02 i ordered and i swear the pizza was out at 12 05 the pizza looked impressive however as i started eating i found the bottom crust to be quite soggy in the middle i can t help but compare this pizza to the one i had a few weeks ago at antica pizzeria in marina del rey which also serves authentic neapolitan style pizza this pizza while good just did not measure up the pizza at antica had a more sturdy bottom and more of a char on the crust this pizza was just too loose in the middle because of their eclectic menu i will be back and try one of their other pizzas pomo is an attractive looking restaurant and it fits nicely in the borgata shopping mall i do find it a little odd that they decided to open it here though as humble pie is right across the street
  i love this place classy and elegant but not as pretentious as one might think go casual for breakfast or lunch and get away with either a simple skirt and blouse or even a more formal dress suit for dinner their coffee is perfectly balanced and goes well with any breakfast food or dessert the steak is literally melt in your mouth fantastic bouchons are very rich and satisfying i will go back whenever the opportunity presents
  went right at lunchtime 1230pm there was a line about 5 or 6 deep with 1 cashier but it went quickly cashier was efficient yet still professional not rushing anyone i got the get up and gogi and it was excellent just as it always is i noticed they did add new smoothies as well which i didn t notice until after i ordered so i will have to go back and try them since they sounded good this location is great staff is always friendly and they are open 24 hours
  i woke from a drunken stupor not knowing where i was how i got here the last thing i remember seeing prior to the temporary shut down of my eyelids was blue martini and the next thing i know i ended up in the philippines this place had all the makings of a typical filipino disco lounge the flowing san miguel beer filipino servers speaking tagalog and karaoke we sat in the patio to get away from the interesting music selections by one of the restaurant patrons and because it was nice to be out there soaking up the mild summer heat the menu was a little blurry because the alcohol was starting to kick in a bit so all i could remember were the pretty steep prices large selection of items i was a little disappointed that some of the entrees didn t come with rice because well filipinos eat practically everything with rice hearing no sorry ma am it doesn t come with rice immediately snapped me out of my lethargic state and i almost keeled over in my seat i ended up ordering the topsilog tocino w 2 fried eggs served over garlic fried rice because of this i don t know if it was the alcohol or if i just didn t have high expectations but it was the best topsilog i ve ever had in my 26 years of existence the sizzling sisig platter that the bf ordered was also just as good who would ve thought that the one of best filipino food restaurants could be found slightly off the strip this will definitely be a a required stop the next time i m in town especially since i have yet to try the drinks there the assortment of pancit desserts
  this place is amazing the friday saturday pork chop special is unlike anything i ve ever had before just make sure to get there early since it seems to always sell out early
  big fans of all of gordon ramsay shows so i was very excited when my girlfriend booked us a reservation for my 40th birthday the hostess took us to our table and along the way pointed out some of the art like the squiggly thing hanging above our head which is supposedly gordon s hand movements when he makes a dish the place is pretty noisy with an open kitchen but was not too bad we looked over the menu and figured out what we wanted then the waiter brought out a meat trolley with all of their cuts of meat he tried to persuade us toward some steak that is 35 and ounce min 3 ounces we weren t interested we ordered our food and again he tried to up sell us i still ordered my standard rib eye steak cooked medium rare she ordered some seafood platter and asked for it all to be cooked well done our food came out and my steak was medium at best and some of her fish was med rare the steak was tough i seriously have had more tender steaks at a all you can eat buffet in the colony tx the sides were okay but nothing special have had better sides at the local sports bar i would never go back just another tourist trap
  stopped in because we had a g pon craft beer selection was quite nice bottle selection is pretty decent and they also have an attached beer distributor for cases walking back to the restroom which was clean noticed a wide selection of board games which you can pull out and play observed 4 gents playing magic which they brought with themselves the night we were there during happy hour they had a fantastic cheese selection a goat cheese brie mimolette first time for this fantastic cheese smoked gouda swiss and 3 other selections my beer selection for the evening was troegs mad elf and the wife chose wittekerke rose an belgian import for an appetizer we ordered the hummas platter the platter had warm pitas feta balsamic tomatoes and pitted kalmata olives very good judee ordered the lobster roll with fresh cut fries and coleslaw the lobster was very large chunks with a good taste the fresh cut fries are very good i ordered the reubenation which came with fresh cut fries the sandwich had 4 slices of bread in a stacked combination a little to much bread but tasted good fries as above prices were fair and the g pon made the meal super easy on the wallet service was professional and the well informed of menu and beer selections will patronize when in the area without the incentive
  quick update i ve been coming here at least once a month for the past 6 months quality and consistancy are amazing the adovada is heavenly and seriously addictive see original review for thoughts on spice level
  first visit here interior is nice new and clean it s a burger very similar to in n out presentation wise but not tasting as good lacking pallet luster it appears larger char d taste is nice not overly impressed with food quality my burger was over cooked and bun kind of dry price is reasonable i will try again in the future with cheese it s an option thank you
  i eat here a lot favorite rolls kiss of fire sun devil and something wrong everything is good here though
  good breakfast
  awesome service best t bone steak i have ever tasted came out sizzling tastiest lobster tail good side dishes mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus chocolate cake was a little rich for me but went great with the wine brought our own wine and i dont think they charged a corkage fee decor was simple outside did not impress me on the pricier side but i never mind if the food and service are up too par and both exceeded my expectations location was off the strip would of preferred a nicer view highly recommend
  visited from california and looked for a kbbq place in las vegas found this place and loved it ordered the brisket plate and was delicious side dishes were so plentiful highly recommended for awesome korean bbq
  it s definitely an older looking place needs to be updated but the food is awesome there was so much food we couldn t finish there were 3 of us one got short stack pancakes one got the full house breakfast with blueberry crepes and i got the wild west omelette without ham when they say lots of cheddar cheese they aren t lying only thing is that the potatoes home style potatoes weren t quite done enough for my liking but i like mine more on the softer side everyone else thought they were fine you definitely get a lot for your money and the food is great coffee is really good too not too strong and not too weak cups are very large we all agreed that we would come back again
  this place is delicious however it s actually a mondo burger that serves breakfast
  alright i ve been here plenty and for some reason the thought of writing a review kept escaping me let s start off with the fact that i can never tell when it s open the amount of light that this place gets is equal the amount that batman gets in his cave i get the bar atmosphere they re trying to go for but also try and understand the concept of natural light besides the atmosphere being very college y and bar esque i love the pizza here it satisfies the gluttonous alter ego that i have the slice has to be served on two plates because that s right one plate is just not enough folks this epic slice of pizza is bigger than the size of any human being s face including nicolas cage s they have an assortment of pizza toppings to choose from as well everything ranging from the classic cheese to mediterranean toppings and one of my favorites hawaiian toppings i know that they make the pizzas beforehand and just warm up the slices to serve but i don t care if it tastes good i like it
  it s small it s quaint the food is ok but the patio is super cute i would come here if not just to kick back and enjoy a nice warm day i had the breakfast burrito and it definitely required the use of salsa as i found it to be a little dry it was tasty with salsa and of a good size the menu isn t very extensive but again i think people come more for the atmosphere than the food
  the food is good but the service is absolutely horrible took 10 mins to order drinks and an hour to get our food the waiters are slow and business is under staffed
  was that a burger i was so turned off by the charred greasy whatever that was on my bun i couldn t take a second bite or even make myself eat the fries or order any custard so based on the one bite i could stomach less than 1star
  5 stars all the way i came here yesterday and came back not just because of how amazing the cheese steak was but also because of the amazing customer service outstanding i had the bobbie today i wish i could say something different from all the other reviews but it is just like thanksgiving it is amazing the cranberry sauce tastes and looks homemade the turkey has such and amazing taste that only comes from slow roasting i can t say enough about this place it will now be a regular lunch stop for me
  my parents enjoy mexican food and when they visit us we go here now that viva mercados closed their tamales are decent but i think the place is a little overpriced and the margaritas and rest of the food are just okay but i must admit i have yet to find a better mexican restaurant in the valley i have many favorites in my hometown of san diego that would blow this place away but i am not traveling 8 hours for a mexican dinner out
  super busy full of kids loud music the servers did not fill up my coffee or water i also paid eight yes eight dollars for a bowl of quinoa and oatmeal i expected a large bowl and honestly it was the equivalent of one of those oatmeal packets i have actually been to other snooze locations this fell to the bottom of that list pretty quickly
  i think my expectations were too high i was thinking nopa in sf nopasf com you can decide for yourself what i got below some low points the greeting i don t expect a happy cheerleader but i do expect eye contact and an attempt at a smile or welcoming nature i saw this lacking with folks who arrived after we did too experimental i was very excited when reviewing the menu the simple labels and titles are great but upon arrival of the dishes i was overwhelmed for a person who loves to experiment with new food and gives everything a try this is a first if you stumble upon this place while looking for the old fashioned keep looking high points our waitress was great efficient friendly knowledgeable quite nice in madison the atmosphere is awesome very good for both a small group or an intimate dinner the cocktail was delicious i will give it another try as i want to check out the bar hopefully that will raise the score
  ok this place is on the top of my list for great sandwiches kind of a hidden gem in the myers park area nice little locally owned store with plenty of wine beer and some fantastic food i m in love with the 4 on sourdough turkey bacon the crispiest i ve found pepper jack cheese and a chipotle spread oh yeah throw some lettuce tomato on there too i ve tried a couple others all have been good they serve up some breakfast dishes as well as a daily soup or two different breads wraps to choose from this place has it going on it s can get a little hectic in this small space i don t think there is any official line when ordering it s also only to go orders not a problem here take my sammich and go
  i really love their wings they are big and very nicely prepared with your choice of sauces to choose from we always get the honey bourbon bacon flavored also highly recommend the turkey ellie sandwich good people go here families too tv s everywhere great space full bar and plenty of different beers to choose from including left hand milk stout on draft great football fans know this is the place to go thank you gym you make us feel welcome every time we walk in the door
  had the chorizo tacos they were awesome i recommend you give this spot a try the service was quick and food was prepared fast
  local favorite due to location and price highly recommend the southwest chicken salad zesty and good portion size their normal fries are great
  i ve come here on saturday night and the atompshere is awesome i ve also come here on a lunch date the food is great
  awesome food all i got to say they deliver and you also can eat in friendly people also portions are good size
  i really appreciate the food ere it is quality i come from the east valley and hasn t found decent chinese food on the west valley till this restaurant arrived
  food was interesting not just your usual egg options i had a special of poached eggs with smoked trout capsicum hollandaise and courgette flower fritters on brioche was a bit too heavy and rich for me but was tasty came with a side of fruit which i thought was a good touch coffee was ordinary service was good for a busy restaurant would recommend if you want a very hearty breakfast
  the iceberg salad with what was kindly called buttermilk ranch actually just buttermilk i m pretty sure was sub optimal the rolls and bread were good and the special i got the night i went was freaking amazing overall it was a semi quiet place to sit and have a meal the servers were very polite and excellent i was never wanting for a drink and everything ran very smoothly
  this is the only wendy s restaurant i would ever give 5 stars to every single i travel by plane i do it for a living this is my go to breakfast place i always get the bacon artisan with the breakfast potatoes and one sausage egg and cheese biscuit on the side regardless of the size of the line it always moved quickly and efficiently i ve never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for the entire process including getting my meal gilbert is always friendly and seems like he s a beast at his job always plugging away and working efficiently i ve never had an order messed up in any way and my food is always hot and closely resembles the pictures on the menu good job wendy s
  this place was great a little slow but it was really busy the best sushi in vegas
  great sushi for a great price came with a group of 10 and we ordered 7 or 8 sushi rolls to share california and spicy tuna rolls were great the x files was also a favorite also ordered edamame and general tso s chicken the sake listing was quite impressive also definitely recommend staff is great and very attentive
  same as a few other reviews on here i love their sandwiches but they are ridiculous about the delivery area he told me it stopped a half mile from my house and refused to deliver to me take my money damn it i want a bootlegger
  i visited roaring fork with a group of people from work the menu was limited by our planner but that was not an issue at all they set us up in a back room to provide us with privacy when we sat down the preplanned menu choices were on a placard with our company logo nice touch the service was exceptional and the wine glasses were never empty the appetizers were a buffet of mexican favorites which were all delicious i ordered the dr pepper rib and tasty does not begin to tell the story it was cooked so perfectly that all i needed was a butter knife to cut it up it was served with asparagus and mashed potatoes to finish off great meal i had creme brulee which i couldn t even finish not because it wasn t great it was but i was so full from the meal the next time i m in the valley i will be visiting roaring fork
  this is quiet a story about this place my wife need alu gobi for her lunch and i ran to pyar india restaurant bcos its pretty close to us they charge 15 for it and i thought it would be as good as the price but she couldn t even a get bite out of that extremely spicy alu gobi pyar india made then i ran to samosa factory few miles away almost to closing time at 3 00 pm but i saw the friendly owner and the service he provide me best as their alu gobi the way my wife needed also cheaper i was really happy and thankful for the owner made my day even though they were closed thank you samosa factory you rock
  ordered the rosemary chicken for my first pasty experience i was really impressed filling tasty and unique a few hiccups the drafts were not in working order i do believe they may be epanding this location because it s rather small the other bottle beer my table ordered they were out of too one other side note there are no substitutions you get what you get and you don t throw a fit i m not an onion fan at all so my choices were pretty limited but as i stated up top the rosemary chicken did the trick for me
  the food is amazing but their service is about the slowest i have ever had it was the worst anytime we wanted something we had to flag someone down in passing forgot one thing we ordered and brought it late still charged us for it but no offer up on how they can make it up to us it was 50 wine night and they still didn t charge us correctly we didn t even look at the bill we just wanted to get out of there and we tired of sitting around after the fact we notice they didn t charge my wine correctly when i had spoke to am employee about it before i ordered will we back the food was amazing and the chefs infront of you were very helpful he explained the hot sauce and was very informative but the rest of the service was awful we might give them another try or go on a night where time isn t an issue
  i visited this location on the 19th with my dad when i was out here on vacation from chicago he lives near phoenix and has been to this location and the one in scottsdale many times and he suggested we go here like many of the other reviewers i strongly recommend the raj ipa if hoppy beers are your thing and though i didn t have it while dining here we picked up a 6 pack of their kiltlifter at a grocery store in avondale the night before and was also highly impressed as for the food both the sweet jalapeno chicken sandwich beer battered fries i got here and the grilled chicken beer bread a wrap at the scottsdale location were honestly about as tasty of chicken sandwiches as i ve ever had and they do not skimp on portion size i would have tried more beer but i literally could not fit anything else in my stomach and the service was very fast and very friendly as well my bottom line is this if four peaks is still in business the next time i m out in the phoenix area coming back here will be a must
  this is a darling little restaurant in the heart of old town glendale the service was extremely friendly and the chef was extremely attentive the menu is surprisingly brief a few appetizers a few sandwiches and a few entrees i ordered a malbec wine which was served chilled when i asked for my red wine at room temperature the server replaced my glass with wine that was so sour that it tasted like vinegar i didn t complain it s a new place and i m sure they are working out the kinks however no red wine drinker i know of drinks their wine chilled anyway i ordered the cuff posole which i was told by the server that people love so much that one customer liked his plate it was ok i m not a smoked pork fan and it seems almost every dish consists of smoked pork i d prefer it with chicken my husband ordered the eggplant parm sandwich it was delicious and the salad that came with was equally delish i d like to see more variety on the menu more dishes made with chicken and my red wine served at room temp
  has anyone said dakao is da bomb yet it is after a perfectly fine breakfast at lee s the day before we went to dakao for their awesome super fresh breakfast baguette with eggs and meat but we also specified to include all the normal vietnamese hoagie fixins picked up some sides with it including sesame balls and a kind of banana dessert that we weren t sure about but also turned out to be totally delicious add to that the electric jolt known as iced cafe sua and we were off to the races this is the kind of shop i d come to all the time if it were close by because you can just assume everything is good and whatever treats they make that day will be worth trying
  reasonably priced if you are in vegas and want to mix up your taste buds this place has good thai food the restaurant itself has relaxing environment amd the staff is good order alacarte and share you will enjoy the variety of items they have to offer
  good food overall but the storefront could use some work to make for a nicer dining experience the place was clean and service was fine i would absolutely order take out or delivery from here
  i ve been going here for about 4 years the staff are friendly the food comes out hot and very good tasting i love the chicken teriyaki bowl the luncheon menu is the best deal sometimes i would order lunch meals and take them home for dinner you must order before 4 pm
  i had a cheeseburger and fry it was way better and bigger than i expected filling too the fact that it came with ice cream didn t hurt either yum
  this place let me tell you rocks listen i m an east coaster raised on ny and nj style pizza i might say this place converted me to chicago style the deep dish is awesome do what i did and just add whatever toppings you like my wife ordered a specialty out first time and didn t like it but ever since she s liked her choices we ve been there about 4 times now gets better every time the deep dish crust is the perfect crunch the sauce is awesome and fresh and the toppings are perfect i love a place that has real sausage and not the slices or rolled up balls i ve never eaten there i get it to go always because we have little ones but there are always families with kids there the owner is a really cool guy and will stop and have conversation with you only get the deep dish don t get the thin crust and complain you ll notice everyone reviewing poorly had the thin crust this is a mainstay and i wouldn t be surprised if more start popping up in the valley
  i ve been so disappointed by the past few mexican restaurants i was starting to feel like maybe my tastes had changed well y tastes hadn t changed i was just eating a lot of crappy mexican until i found this place my car dealer is down the road and i didn t want to wait there for service and then i found this place while walking by the chips are perfect crispy but still a bit of firmness to scoop up salsa the salsa has cilantro which i love if you think cilantro tastes like soap it s genetic i have no time for you i ordered the mole poblano chicken mole the chicken fresh not like it had been cooked hours ago and dipped in mole at the last minute the decor is clean and bright i wouldn t even say i liked it because they americanized it i think it s pretty authentic since i m the only one in here who speaks english as a first language this place is great
  great beer selection i visited montreal and this was a great place to get some food and a few beers
  my favorite breakfast place in arizona the service is amazing the food is amazing you must try this restaurant it is a little outdated with the decor and uniforms the staff wears but don t let that fool you wonderful place to eat
  i d give this a 5 but i think we should all leave room for improvement i moved here from ca and was looking for a mom pop type place for good mexican food i found this on yelp and have to say i am really happy with what i ve had here first i had a breakfast burrito chorizo and then added sour cream perfect next time i was in for dinner i tried their chile verde burrito i had them add beans wow really really good hit the spot i think i found my new go to favorite
  well if there was zero i would give that as my rating just had an 8 30 reservation and showed up and they told us it would be a 20 minute wait what is the point of a reservation
  love this food quick clean great portions kebabs are outstanding and so are the appetizers rice is fragrant and comes with all the kebabs
  soooo good i was in the mood for greek so we looked around on yelp for a good place to try based on the ratings came here ratings are all true tried the chicken schwarma and chicken mechoui they were both amazing the owners were so sweet
  i completely forgot to post this awful this place dropped flyers in our hotel so we decided to try it my sister called and ordered a pizza a little after 930 the person on the phone said it would take 45 minutes it was a force but we went with it because we didn t want to leave our room over 2 hours later the delivery guy comes with our pizza i paid him and after opening the pizza everything was ice cold my sister called back to complain and get her money back and the lady said she would send the delivery guy back to return the money but they would need to take back like are you fucking serious i kid you not and hour and a half later the driver comes back with our money and to shamelessly take the food back this place deserves no stars save your money people
  as promised i came back yesterday for dinner i tried the herbal salad and had mixed feeling about the dish it was either good or bad it just had too much coconut red onion but barely any tofu to balance the taste for a vegetarian dish the non dairy ice coffee was good the server recognized me and was very friendly the place did get crowded after 6 p m perharps i have to come back for the third time to order the right dish
  messy and delicious we got a pound of louisiana style spicy crawfish and a pound of the hot n juicy special medium shrimp our waitress told us that the spicy level was really really spicy but it was still an enjoyable spice in my opinion the service was great and the food came out fast definitely a fun and unique dining experience getting messy and peeling the shrimp crawfish all over the table my hands still smell like the sauces from all the peeling but i don t care because the sauce was so good
  ted s is awesome from the way they cook their dogs to the quality of their ingredients you cant go wrong eating at ted s we always take people from out of town here and they all wish they had a ted s in their town i always get an all beef w my version of chicago style fixings they have celery salt just ask i love their onion rings as an onion enthuiest im never impressed w onion rings that are all batter ted s has the perfect amount my hubby being an onion hater always goes for the cheese fries how can you not love ted s
  it was ok went for valentines day was not happy that they really didn t do anything to give it a valantine feel i didn t need pink stuff everywhere but maybe some ambience music or something a lady playing the harp some music or something it was a dull vibe staff was friendly food was just ok not up to par for the price i ordered a well done steak and it came medium at best but it was ok
  incredible sandwiches of the highest quality the only sandwich that i ve had that even compares to this is at pane bianco this place might even be better well done sir easily in the top two best sandwich places in the whole valley
  i am upping the rating best vegetarian options anyone can get cannot go wrong with the vegetable combo g approved
  stopped here on a whim and was pleasantly surprised had a black rice sushi roll and was satisfied i d peg it as a great quick stop for lunch liked the black rice so much that i bought some at sprouts
  best fish and chips better than at a london pub shepard s pie was amaziiiiing the meat was very well done definitely coming back ps brunch menu only available on sunday s but they do have a few brunch specials on other days
  my first visit today a little hidden from view on t south side of jarry just off the beaten path enough so that it was relatively quiet on a winter afternoon of writing reading cozy and beautiful inside delicious coffee great tea selection and from t looks of it hot toddies as well sweets and soups to boot i was pleasantly surprised that a macchiato and 3 cookie plate was under 6 highly recommend and look forward to trying a savoury something next time
  i would not recommend eating here service was very slow six people six different entrees all bad
  our group was wondering what was good on the menu and asked our waitress for input she said to try the limit 2 margaritas 11 95 two of my friends said the drink was strong one of us opposed i also disagreed it was definitely salty though we grubbed on the chips on salsa and drank our margaritas as we waited for our food to come out the chips were really good especially the chips that had the sweet topping on it but too much of that can make you sick i kind of did and had to stop finally our order came out i had ordered the mango buffalo salad as suggested by the waitress and it was a featured item on the menu it was alright i was too full to even finish the tostada
  adrienne is the best waitress you ll find she s personable sociable and fun to be around when you eat here you ll be satisfied with the food and the service make sure you ask to be seated at adrienne s section
  the best greek joint in town excellent and fresh every time get the rice bowl or the plates you won t go wrong
  can i have more steak with this fat geez it was a tiny steak with more fat and it will run you 16 rip off never again only good thing is the tvs with espn
  bank is the best manager ever been there a few times but this time he made it better yoshi was our server and he checks up on you helps you with menu we went during happy hour with drinks too bank told us their popular drink and it was amazing keep up the good work and see you on your next day off
  i was craving fried rice and lo mein but i didn t want to go to panda express so i decided to try this place out because of the good reviews plus it s only 3 miles away from my house i didn t dine in i called them and ordered for pick up i got the basil fried rice with tofu lo mein noodles with tofu and the steamed veggies with tofu i absolutely love tofu the steamed veggies also come with white rice and a brown sauce i thought all of the food i got was going to be side dishes since everything was only 4 99 but nope i literally got 3 big entrees you get a lot of food for what you pay for the lo mein was delicious and the veggie plate with steamed rice and brown sauce was mouth watering the basil fried rice was a little funky because of the basil haha it s really good but then you get hit with an intense after taste of basil i can handle it but people who absolutely cannot stand basil should skip it or ask if they can get the rice without the basil i just threw some soi sauce on it and it was yummy i only gave this place 4 stars because i don t know how their dine in experience works but next time i will definitely go here to eat instead of calling in i also will try some of their entrees with meat in it to see how it taste so all in all the food was great and the price was even better you gotta try this place
  24 bill for 2 sandwiches chips and drinks ok it s an unfair comparison but this is a strip mall in glendale not at fricking westgate so the food service better be insanely good i had a large sandwich wifelette had a small sandwich sandwiches were same size that s a problem when there s a 2 disparity and i m not sure if this is an aberration but it s one that doesn t bode well for a return they do have silly names which requires a load of scanning though helpfully broken up into meat shape types i found that after ordering there were two or more signs now apparent with today s offers on them it s pretty busy from a couple of feet e g regrets instantly for not seeing what else they had and given that there s a lot of out of stock discontinued on the board it may take a first timer a while to check out all that s available then again maybe you have a go to sandwich so all is happy and well in your land it s really good food fresh and while the custom components are there i felt that they were shy ne embarrassed to be on the bread e g dan and debbie s fiesta had skimmings of the sauce and other ingredients so either it s attempt to be subtle or just as tight assed a sandwich as the basis for my review 10 sandwich better be worthy of mia s 5 shake again this is only 1 experience so i may go back and see if this is how it s meant to be but it s really a 3 5 to me at present
  normally i get a burrito from blue burrito then head over to my favorite watering hole corcoran s however i didn t have much time this trip so i stopped by jose cuervo tequileria to have a beer and blue burrito food this time i had their veggie burrito it was beans rice lettuce tomato sour cream cheese and guacamole they put way too much lettuce in this burrito normally i have a steak or chicken burrito but opted for the veggie while it tasted good the lettuce drowned out the other flavors atmosphere it s a fun bar to hang out at plenty of seats and free wifi will i return yes but probably won t order the veggie next time
  i ve been to this location maybe more than 20 times and today i received the absolute worst service i ve ever had starting from the cashier with glasses to the girl who handed me my drink also wearing glasses one with dark brown hair the other with blonde we asked for a design on our lattes and were first told they couldn t do it when on yelp and instagram the photos are all over not to mention every time i ve come in they do a design on our lattes after asking the barista she said ok the lattes came out with the least amount of effort put into them as you can see in the picture come on sambalatte if your workers don t like what they are doing don t have them working
  excellent food bbq burger fries grilled cheese tatar tots everything was 5 stars will be back
  we have tried a lot of things from their large menu and consistently the food is always good we especially like the late night happy hour as it makes the already quite cheap large appetizers half price and this is a steal great atmosphere whether sitting inside or out of course they have good beers also which is a bonus
  i really think this place is the best place to get quality seafood in arizona the food is pricey but well worth the money service is top notch and the atmosphere is perfect for couples looking for a romantic dining experience make sure to get reservations though
  my bad for ordering the grilled shrimp salad 13 at a burger focused restaurant that said it was still disgusting 5 well grilled and butterflied shrimp lay on a bed of completely plain mixed greens no onions tomatoes vinaigrette nada topped with olive oil and red bell peppers zucchini strips that had been cooked to death at one point and then set aside long enough to become slimy it felt like i was hunting for worms in a lettuce patch never again i left at least 60 of the salad for the garbage bloody marys 12 are a 5 star affair if you re looking for a drink while you re there good tomato to spiciness ratio and comes with cheese stuffed olives yum i d definitely give this place another go sticking solely with a burger next time my friend had the hubert keller 21 and after the first bite said he jizzed himself seems promising til then cheers
  i eat here under the same circumstances as when i would eat at faustos when i m starving low on cash tipsy or have many mouths to feed get the pot stickers they re homemade and the dipping sauce is delicious another favorite of mine is the war wonton soup
  came in from vegas to visit a friend on my way back home to l a been to many sushi restaurants and i must say this is one of the better ones with the combination of ambiance great service and quality of food you can t go wrong being the first time i was here our super heroesque server jade made the dinner selections very easy she was stupendous great food great service will be back when in phoenix
  i really love their cassoulet and have had it twice now they are quite generous and one order comes with fresh bread and there is always enough for leftovers the coconut cake and quiches are also both great though i wish their bread were a bit more flavorful
  it s salad how fattening can it be don t be fooled you can t get out of here for less than 2000 calories bit our fun getting there even if you have to run it off later really good salad lots of good carbs decor is nothing to write yelp about women like this place more than men i think
  good food and good service every time i eat here it s all anyone wants when we dine out and this particular cpk gets it right
  always great to come in here food is great and staff is friendly our server falcone was extremely helpful and curteous love watching our cardinals win here
  they have a good beer selection and it is cool to be in a 100 year old bungalow they are a little more pricey unless you go during lunch the food eh if it is authentic brit food then i don t want to go to the uk don t get anything fried there because it s well gross i did have the bangers and mash which is pretty decent the staff does their job but they aren t the friendliest bunch i don t know if you are downtown there are other places to go to have a better time and food you just don t quite get the value for your dollar there they aren t horrible but they seem like they are pretty neutral as to whether you are served well or not or get decent food
  been here some 3 times and its always hit or miss mostly miss first time had the spaghetti and meatballs the pasta was watery 2nd time had the blt there s nothing better than a mile high blt stacked with bacon very good 3rd time chicken noodle soup never again how do you screw up chicken noodle soup it wasn t flavorful at all in fact it tasted like they threw in all the ingredients with a watered down can of chicken broth
  zoup is a very interesting new restaurant soups salads and sandwiches with an emphasis on the soup they have 100 soups with 12 in rotations everyday they had 3 vegetarian options available for soup and multiple sandwich options i only tried soup and it was pretty delectable the decor and ambiance is also very quaint it is a little pricey but the soups are great and worth the money i most definitely want to go back and try more
  they are no longer korean tacos offered i will miss them on a side note the hospitality here is really unparalleled joe is always welcoming and remembers my name without a stutter even though the frequency of my visits are once a month anyways combining his friendly service with the quality and obvious craftsmanship he devotes into a simple hot dog makes the lunch box a winner another side note i get the waffle ice cream sandwich every time i get a chance regardless if the weather outside is 50 degrees it is really that difficult to pass on a thick crispy waffle filled with chocolate chips sheltering ice cream
  be sure to read the menu before sitting down not everyone can find food they will like here i ended up here with some friends on search for brunch not really a breakfast place unless you want lunch items food was perhaps too healthy for our tastes kale with a burger i asked to see the kid s menu hoping that they may have something more traditional on that but alas more items concocted from a health food store food was a bit bland and tasted like what i make at home this restaurant is great for people who love super healthy food but not folks looking for healthy normal food
  best ho fun that i have had since leaving home it was so flavorful and just perfect also the lunch specials are killer 2 sides and fried rice for only 5 95 i really want to dine in at this restaurant as i have only had take out so far
  it s hard to find good bbq in arizona why because most folks here make better bbq at home than at restaurants that being said i am always on the lookout for a go to bbq place and bootleggers so far has my attention let s start with the bad and it s really just one thing the chairs omg are they uncomfortable i am talking about those yellow orange patio chairs in the dining room from the moment i sat down till i left the chairs were making me hate the experience i am not disabled or elderly but little stocky 6 1 250lbs and the chair was pure torture those that get to sit on the booth side are ok but i will never dine there if i have to sit in that chair again just saying now the good everything else the service was good nothing memorable i ll chalk it up to a busy saturday night that our waiter when asked if i want my entree which really was an app on the menu to arrive before or with the other entrees did not listen to my response since i was treating the nacho flat as my entree i asked that it come out with everyone else s food nope came out way early and i was done with my meal before anyone else at my table received theirs the waiter did not have the situational awareness to see what a mistake he had made i ll give the place a pass on this just this once i still tipped over 20 despite the rather egregious service error the food however is really good the nacho flat didn t feel like just a plate of nachos at a bar etc it was a whole meal with delicious meat and crispy chips but let me cut to the chase as opposed to describing the menu items the beef brisket and the pulled pork are fantastic so whatever your order as long as it has one of those items you are in a for a great smokey bbq tastegasm the sides were pretty good too the mashed potatoes with goat cheese and cauliflower puree had a wonderful consistency and were flavorful but this place is really about the brisket and the pulled pork nuff said being slightly pricey in line with most old town scottsdale restaurants bootlegger s is not a place i can go to often but when we really need to go out for bbq this is usually the first on our list of options
  food was okay i am not waiting all day for it though if i could go in and get a table right away i d eat here again but waiting more than 10 minutes no thank you i would rather walk to matadors or first watch p s go for the rosemary potatoes not the hash browns unless of course you would like some hash browns with your grease
  this place is now closed and moved to a new location in glendale
  great place for a burger you can t go wrong with a delicious hawaiian burger and good crispy fries plus their hawaiian punch drink is always refreshing especially during the summer
  my uncle has been coming here for 58 years and has never had a bad meal he always says coming here is like coming home i was real pleased with my experience had the best chicken chimi ever
  i go to lone star in west mifflin often they have a great selection of steaks and in varying portion sizes the quality of the steaks is average definitely not the best quality cuts but that said worth what you pay for and without the long wait of other steak houses they have awesome french onion soup and salad wedges too my favorite steak there is the delmonico
  we ve driven past this place tons of times it s always packed so we tried it out this morning and it was amazing we were greeted and seated instantly had a phenomenal wait person the food was excellent sweet potato pancakes were stellar nothing but awesome all around the funky deco lots of animal heads adds to the fun here
  went here after the ces conference for lunch good small bites with a comfortable atmosphere although the food was not special it was fresh and tasted good the lobster and friends was an interesting snack but not really a lunch or dinner portion this place is more of a lounge with appies not a grill their flatbread pizzas looked good however i give it a better rating simply because it is the closest thing to a real restaurant near south hall will come back if i m in vegas for a conference
  fantastic discovery i just moved to phoenix and didn t eat here for weeks but what a treat i ve been several times now and the staff are very friendly and it s just nice to see genuine smiles and service that exceeds expectations for a place that has soooo much to choose from i admit it amazed me that everything i ve gotten thus far was so delicious from a simple basic club sandwhich with a spicy thai cole slaw to a huh jamaican jerk sweet potato not sure who came up with such an unlikely combination but this thing was absolutely off the chain delicious fair to say that unless you are eating at a truly fancy restaurant with an artistic chef you are not going to get such a creative combination i probably don t even need to mention the desserts the chocolate cake slice probably weighs in more than most whole cakes but besides having it to snack on for days it is one of the very best i have had and i really love a great quality moist chocolate cake from a basic hearty chicken pot pie to a nice steak this place is a really great experience and you won t leave hungry that s for sure geez i just talked myself into going again right now after i post this
  absolutely the best burger i have ever had if you like it a little spicy try the hell s kitchen sandwich
  the bobbie it s good it s different it s thanksgiving in a sandwich cranberry mayo and turkey never tasted so good on a roll it s one of those perfect meals on the way back to la there s nothing else to say i m sure they have excellent sandwiches i ve even tried one before but the fact remains nobody is doing too much for thanksgiving in a sandwich these days for those in los angeles there are a few locations to check out
  very tasty good broth especially with a little sriracha and plum sauce supplement also clean and friendly the owner min had an interesting life story about his escape from vietnam in 1984 next time i ll try their spicy beef noodle soup
  it s not easy being green sang kermit well it s not easy being vegan especially in buffet capital of the world pura vida bakery and bystro is making it a lot more tasty as part of our first annual vegan vegas visit my vegan daughter had this fledgling eatery on her list of to dos the food was amazing and i have suffered through a lot of experimental cardboard fresh creative and good enough for me to refuse to leave any behind the high point of the visit was the chance to meet and talk with owner chef mayra about her vision for vegan food in las vegas and the restaurant she finally opened to share that vision the food is the reason to visit the location is a starter one the opportunity to eat fresh ethically produced food of this level is priceless bravo chef mayra
  so the first time i ate here i didn t order their spicy galbi jjim i didn t make that mistake this time talk about a mouthful of flavor that starts off a little sweet and creeping up with some spice the 3 of us were sweating by the time all was said and done and this place is def my 1 stop for korean food in vegas the service is just a tad above par for korean restaurants so we got what we needed when we wanted it def go during lunch time so you can avoid any possible busy periods i assume everyone was still sleeping or hungover when we got there as only 1 other group was seated prices are reasonable for vegas
  i recently went to heidi s for the first time and it was great they had a white board with the day s special written on it a chicken salad sandwich that came with mayo mustard lettuce tomato and onion your choice of a side potato salad coleslaw or chips and a fountain drink for 5 95 what a great deal we asked the girl working if she liked the chicken salad and she replied that she did not like it because they use honey in it i appreciated her honesty and got it anyway i like honey the chicken salad was great certainly not what i expect chicken salad to taste like but delicious i chose to have it on pumpernickle bread which they bake fresh i decided on potato salad for my side it is made with red potatos and tasted good but the portion was very small now that i know how tiny the side portions are i will always get a bag of chips instead i am excited to go back and try some real deli classics and see what else they offer for cheap daily specials
  this has become my favorite brunch spot kudos pittsburgh on making it difficult for me to decide their bloody mary bar is an adult candy store where you can accessorize your mug of belvedere s with pickled turnips ochra cornichons and at least a dozen different hot sauces besides the drinks the food is all phenomenal best eggs benedict pastami to die for be back soon
  the service here is excellent prompt courteous helpful the restaurant is clean and the food was downright tasty i arrived with a group of 18 the servers were so friendly and fast i ordered the southwest biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon it was delicious the syrup was offered warm to the pancake waffle orders
  came on a weekday night there were plenty of seats at this location no wait time service is friendly and efficient food isn t anything special however if visiting vegas no need to go out of the way
  not allegy friendly the waitress was fantastic told her about my daughters dairy allergy and she made a great recommendation half way through the meal we started seeing feta cheese on the lettuce the kitchen staff had just picked off the cheese from the top of the salad the manager took the meal off our check but are they going to stay up with my daughter while she cries in pain as the dairy clear her system won t be returning
  great place sad that alex stratta is gone
  good smoked meat seems like pastrami to me portion size of food is much better than new york s over the top delis and well priced if you like smoked beef this is a great place
  we end up here more often than i care to admit in public forum lol for some reason our friends family and visitors love this buffet i have to be honest i actually like it too no it is not fancy like some of the strip buffets but it is a solid fresh buffet that has a great assortment of meats some seafood etc like roast beef ribs gourmet sausages shrimp etc etc the better seafood is limited to the weekends when they charge a bit more they have an awesome desert section with cakes pies and a gigantic make your own sundae counter even a large sugar free selection let s talk service even though it is a buffet trust me you still want an efficient friendly person taking care of your table don t forget to throw a little green on the table when you leave i have always found the service here to be top notch friendly sometimes even funny in a good way insider tip if you do not have a stations reward card go get one when you arrive at any stations casino there are so many benefits to having them discounts galore and it is free breakfast mon sat 9 99 only 6 99 with rewards card pretty good a lot of basics and a lot to choose from lunch mon sat 11 99 only 8 99 with rewards card this is a scaled down version of dinner no complaints dinner sun thurs 18 99 only 13 99 with rewards card great selection for dinner heavier on the proteins and a few more dishes than lunch the weekends are the busiest time so they pull it all out this is when you will see the crab legs the fancy meats etc but it is also when there is usually a long line fri sat night prime rib shrimp 21 99 only 16 99 with rewards card sunday brunch 18 99 only 13 99 with rewards card enjoy
  i really just do not like this place i know it is the cool thing to love it however i find it completely overwhelming as a person with no knowledge of cheese getting service to ask a question is nearly impossible they do not cater to those people new to cheese and when you get poor service it makes the smell a bit much to handle i wanted to buy cheese even though it was pricey but they do not seem to have enough staff to address their customers i found it annoying that some of them were chatting behind their counter i wish i could review your cheese but i can not get past your service
  not only have the employees been incredibly helpful and friendly to me but i ve found some entrees that i look forward to having day in and day out they have microwaves on site if you want to cook and eat there i m partial to the tacos but because they are microwaved meals the corn tortilla usually cracks before you can eat it for breakfast my top 3 are 1 good morning sunshine spicy ground turkey served over eggs and rice topped with pico de gallo cheese 2 farmhouse steak eggs yukon gold mashed potatoes and scrambled eggs paired with marinated flank steak 3 breakfast tacos lean ground turkey with eggs cheddar cheese served over corn tortillas for lunch my top 3 are 1 chicken and sausage gumbo creole style chicken breast andouille sausage gumbo 2 shredded beef tacos spicy shredded beef topped with pepper jack cheese served in corn tortillas 3 omega me crazy salmon ginger glazed scottish salmon with sugar snap peas carrots for dinner i ve only tried the ninja tenderloin and the butternut pork i love the tenderloin and the heated fresh spinach is pretty good i enjoy the pork but the butternut is a little too al dente for me but all this is clean eating at its finest check out the stats on some of these meals the protein count ranges right around 40g a serving for the regular sizes
  i had brunch here after staying at the westin with my wife this weekend we got the buffet because we d heard it was very good and the food tasted good everyone was very nice and prompt but for a 60 breakfast with tip i have to say i expected something a little better so it s good food but not quite worth the money they re charging
  aloha kitchen is mesa s best kept secret i ve been coming here since i was a toddler so about 20 years it s my favorite food in the world literally better than anywhere else i always get the teriyaki chicken plate with the potato mac with a manapua yum
  not what i expected didn t realize it was all you can eat perfect stop for my college boy son who can eat like a horse great menu selections staff was cool mini lecture on how it s done here was not cool will be back and look out gen s the college boy will be bringing his big eater buddies
  do yourself a favor and eat here the plantains were cooked to perfection the yucca bread that came before the meal was just wonderful and the spicy dip was the perfect accompaniment i enjoyed everything on my plate i got the half chicken i will be back again soon
  a chain should always be a well oiled machine and this spot sure is attentive staff that s knowledgable and recommends great options wine lost should be called wine lost an ipad because there are about 529406373 wines i get it having variety helps but dang
  i ll go here for a cocktail called the import everything is amazing here staff food famous chopped salad atmosphere even being in the center of old town scottsdale it doesn t get obnoxious there are nights where they are jam packed even around the bar plan ahead if you are going on a date
  the place has pho and sushi it s fast and fine
  a great steakhouse with a traditional menu excellent service and a nice atmosphere i ve been to the palm in tyson s corner va which is equally nice but it was a work event in a private room so it was hard to judge so when we realized we didn t have reservations but the palm in vegas could take us for dinner i jumped at the chance it was pricey but very worth the money i had a gut busting 26 ounch slice of heavenly prime rib and it was cooked perfectly the potatos au gratin were okay but i like the ones at ruths chris better we were so full we didn t have dessert which is too bad because i ve heard they re great here overall a great traditional restaurant if you re looking for fusion this nouveau that food go elsewhere but if you want an awesome steak or salmon which my wife had this is the place to go
  place is incredibly good everything i have tried has been best quality compared to the other the local restaurants
  the skinny do get the lovely brioche and the muffins take a pass on the waffle sandwich and pastrami sandwich though 3 service okay counter service but nothing outstanding 3 value a so so meal at a so so price 3 when my hubby sniffed out this spot i was impressed hearing a former pastry chef from bouchon was opening a pastry brunch place in henderson is pretty exciting we ordered our food and munched on their lovely preserves and stellar buttery brioche as we waited for our entrees we ordered a waffle sandwich a pastrami sandwich a loaf of their brioche and a box of goodies to go the waffle sandwich 2 nutmeg infused waffles ham scrambled eggs bechamel sauce was okay but nothing i would order again yes the waffles were really lovely and crisp and i would probably order that alone however the bechamel sauce was overly thin rendering an unpleasant texture to the whole dish i would definitely not get this one again the pastrami sandwich suffered from two major issues first of all it was encased in an overly large and dense mini loaf of rye bread which overwhelmed what little filling was inside secondly the pastrami was overly smoked and too strong for my tastes this definitely something i would not recommend to anyone we also got a pb j brioche an apple tart and a blueberry muffin the pb j brioche is actually a peanut butter flavoured brioche with jam in the middle personally i thought that the addition of the peanut butter to the bread lead to a poor texture to the bread overly dense texturally it was a far step below the heavenly brioche we snacked on the apple tart was good in terms of the sweetness not too sweet however the pastry crust wasn t quite as crisp as i thought it would be overalll it was okay but nothing i would get again the blueberrry muffin on the other hand was absolutely fabulous the top was perfectly crisp while the inside had a nice airy texture with lots of blueberries in the batter it also was not overly sweet as well i would go back just to try their other muffin flavours as i mentioned before the brioche is fantastic buttery light it is a wonderful rendition and a steal for around 4 25 a loaf given the quality overall some hits and some misses but i would for sure raid their pastry counter again for that this place deserves a 3 starred review
  fabulous fresh healthy inviting clean and the service is amazing love love love this place
  i m having trouble putting into words the fantastic experience that just happened in my mouth i had the spicy chicken sandwich the chicken was perfectly flavored perfectly tender and perfectly crispy the garlic aioli was just the right amount of spicy then add the crisp just right tomato and thick slice of cold mozzarella this sandwich phenomenally delicious and the steamed multi color potatoes were the perfect side to this sandwich new favorite lunch spot maybe so
  so much hype we were promised that this was going to be an amazing experience and it really wasn t maybe my taste buds and stomach were not ready for the explosion of food since i had gone to another buffet earlier in the day the highlight of this buffet is the crab legs i ate them only because i figured that it was the only way i could get my money s worth but the crab legs were cold salty and not even that good plus you have to wait in a long line just to get to it it s not worth it the prime rib was actually pretty good i did like it i also liked the gelato selection at the dessert area speaking of desserts they were probably better than the entrees the hot brownie was also delicious the creme brulee was below par while the top was fine the custard underneath tasted very odd i ve had a lot of creme brulees in my life and this one didn t make the top 20 i m glad i gave it a try but one time is enough
  definitely a decent brunch spot the parking lot is super small but they offer complimentary valet i absolutely loved the verde bloody mary so delicious i think i ll go back just for that the food is good too not amazing but definitely really good i d happily go back again anytime
  visiting scottsdale with my girlfriend and went to brio for dinner had the pleasure of meeting chef jeffrey perin who gave us some fantastic recommendations we started with the bruschetta quattro a nice sample of their house made bruschetta we then moved onto the fennel sausage roasted tomato trecce pasta which was very flavorful and satisfying next we enjoyed the 14 oz gorgonzola crusted bistecca which was outstanding the meal ended on a sweet note with a petite peanut butter chocolate mousse all in all it was a great experience and a delicious meal next time we re in town we will definitely return
  i think this is a great little place i ve been 2 times now and both times has been perfect there s room for a live singer or band and is a little cramped but that s almost what s so nice about it especially fun for football i m sure pizzas are wonderful so are all the appetizers can t wait to go back
  friends at work helped me tune in to which wich s opening if you like potbelly s you re gonna love which wich they do the conveyor belt sandwich toasting machine thingy and the bread is very similar they won me over with the crazy variety of sandwich options i love their muffaletta olive topping and their honey mustard can t wait to try something else they re at the south east corner of park woodlawn above jason s deli on the upper level row of shops
  i grew up eating here and i can tell you that it never disappoints the food is so delicious pricey yes but worth it you have to have the fajitas here that is the staple and what they do really well after moving 3 hours away i have been craving this place non stop and finally made the trip yesterday i had a special request and they had no problem accommodating me if i could give them 10 stars i would you will stink bad when you leave here and your wallet will be empty but i promise it will be worth it
  at the suggestion of a friend we tried this place last night friday night it was busy when we got there about 6 15 pm and were told that it would be about 25 minutes we were directed to go sit out by the fire pit if we wanted while we waited in about 15 minutes we were seated at a table outside on the patio our server joe hey guy was one of the best servers we ve had in a long while he offered suggestions and we ended up with the nw pub burger with salad and blue cheese dressing and the kobe beef burger with fries both were awesome and the pub burger is to die for during our meal rene a manager came over to ask how we were doing we told him we were first timers he told us to save room for dessert and during that discussion told us we should try them all i told him that if they were on the house we d be happy to and he could come join us long story short he sent over the cherry bread pudding on the house and it was fabuous we will be regulars and can t wait to try some of the other options on the menu everyone was friendly and we had a 5 star experience top to bottom
  service was amazing
  boooooo walked in sat at the kitchen back bar area for five minutes we weren t even greeted we figured that we must have to sit around the other side so we got up walked around and stood around looking lost for another five minutes there isn t a way to tell who works there and who doesn t in the sea of skinny jeans plaid shirts and black rimmed glasses so we finally left i ve eaten here before the food is pretty good but customer service is more important than food i ll take my dollar and properly fitting pants somewhere else
  the best buffalo chicken wings in town who could have imagined that a fish place would have amazing wings they bake them first and then flash fry them you gotta try them
  pretty good food but staff make this place exceptional went twice in a week one for a guys night out and the other on a date night both times had a great experience i had a few different items off the menu the bacon board the sampler grits and shrimp the hash and brisket side items mac and cheese grilled cauliflower steak and coleslaw all items were great the best was the brisket though the people i was with favored the pulled pork the bacon board is a must if you enjoy bacon the three sauces were unique and tasteful the highlight of both evenings were the wait staff the night of guys night out the owner greeted us and shared parts of the menu on the house which made my party feel more welcome my date night was just as great our waitress was fun and had great recommendations we ordered the moonshine flight and beer flight pretty good craft selection with fantastic pairings with the dinner overall the house moonshine was the best the ambiance is very appeasing dark room with great music in the background with everything from r b to contemporary adult rock outside seating is amazing but sortof cold so i stayed inside upon leaving the restaurant the staff came to thank us for visiting this is a place that you must visit
  well a pretty rocky start for my first experience here i phoned in to place a take out order was told it would take 15 minutes so i planned it to arrive at 25 minutes when opening the door the first thing you re greeted with is the serving station dishes cleaning station beverage cart and so on the other odd thing is there is 1 tv in the restaurant and its at this serving station the last thing the staff needs to have in this restaurant stood at the door for nearly 10 minutes before the first hello a few minutes later a waitress asked if i needed help i was then told my food would be up in a minute after 10 minutes of waiting a couple came in they were not greeted and the gentleman said to the lady he was with this isn t a good start let s go elsewhere good move on their part the waitress even told the manager about my frustrations now 20 minutes in waiting for my food but the manager obviously didn t care he said not 1 word to me its very small inside which doesn t bother me at all what bothered me was the fact that seating is limited the restaurant wasn t even half full and the staff couldn t keep up let alone provide a good product got home with the food and really wished i had the past hour or so of my life back with the bruschetta that i was served this location should not be classified as an italian restaurant linguini was descent at best sauce lacked any sort of flavor punch the fresh bread not so fresh rigattoni blah this place is so close to my home and i was really excited to try it for the first time hoping i would have a new neighborhood gem but highly disappointed now unfortunately i will not be going back no second chance here after a witnessing a manager who doesn t care
  love this place great food and the best thing of all they are 24hrs a bit higher on price than expected
  flying biscuit has consistently dropped in service i have been going there since it opened but will not be returning to waste my money last time i had breakfast the coffee was weak the scrambled eggs were runny and the biscuit was not even fully cooked and mushy in the middle my idea of fruit is not just honey dew with melons and two pieces of pineapple chunks i rather go to terrace cafe up the street where they have the original red velvet waffles and the fruit plate actually has a variety of fresh fruit
  i have to say i love the plating at the restaurant food is great as well
  the best japanese cuisine in las vegas off the strip even including the restaurants in the casinos sen of japan still ranks in the top 5 in the city this shouldn t come as too much of a surprise as the owner is a former nobu chef a small pretty well known eatery if you re looking for fresh fish great entrees and a fun environment check this place out
  the staff and atmosphere is great however when it comes to the food i am not impressed both visits i have had here have been disappointing boiled bags are overcooked and chewy fried foods are over seasoned seasonings are not very flavorful this makes me sad because this place is so close by to where i live i wanted it to be good i would pick hot juicy in tempe over this place every time
  we recently discovered this new bbq food truck in buckeye and it s pretty darn good they are located on jackrabbit near circle k south of the 10 tuesday through friday and at the tractor supply on miller on saturday closed on sunday monday since finding the place we have eaten there twice both meals were consistently good this is what we have tried thus far chopped brisket sandwich religious experience level good tender juicy brisket piled high on a delicious toasted roll with just a hint of their tangy sauce chopped pork sandwich good but not up to the brisket s quality in fairness i prefer my bbq pork pulled rather than chopped hot link hoagie spicy smoked sausage sliced into thin disks and piled into a long roll with sauce the sausage was actually quite tasty but maybe too much sauce on my sandwich and the hoagie roll is not as good as the regular sandwich rolls st louis ribs these are awesome served with or without sauce by your choice they are smoked perfectly are very meaty and feature a nice black pepper rub smoked chicken good but the white meat was a tiny bit on the dry side it is complimented nicely by their sauce i must say beans my wife loved these tender pinto style beans with chili style seasoning was that a bit of cumin in there yum overall we are extremely excited to have some great bbq locally here in buckeye i recommend that any fan of smoked meats give this truck a try
  excellent breakfast the huevos ranchero was amazing beautiful presentation and the combination of flavors was unique and prefect also the french press coffee was delicious
  what a cute little place for a fun dinner they have a great bar atmosphere as well we had the meatballs and the skewers the salmon and the steak between our group of 6 everyone was happy and the table was so cute we will be going back and maybe even just head to the bar sometimes for drinks the happy hour was 30 off drinks yay
  the service is amazing the soups are made with heart and soul especially the pho which is always hot and very fresh the place is very clean and the staff incredibly friendly and helpful
  let me put it to you this way subway is next door spend maybe 4 or 5 more bucks at scratch wait 15 more minutes and you have freshly prepared healthy well thought entree s sandwiches salads etc depending on your taste and how quickly you need to leave the choice is clear in my world no offense to subway for the price location and especially the food it s a great little tucked away secret if you have ever used your name and the word foodie in the same sentence and don t make an effort to stop by you may be missing out this is really a quaint little lunch place or even dinner but remember you re there for the food service is not over the top nor bad either sit back relax and enjoy i did
  it s a close one between the top 3 buffets in vegas wynn caesars and wicked spoon cosmopolitan but after trying all three for the nth time i have to still give the edge to the wynn as the top buffet in lv the reason quality while they don t offer nearly as much in terms of variety they make it up by making sure everything they serve is top notch the crab legs here are the best versus any other buffet i ve been to bar none same goes for the prime rib lamb chops and also their pasta and carnitas stations the flavor of all the dishes are excellent and even their breakfast options are good the fresh strawberries they serve is almost worth the price of admission alone the dessert stations here are also top notch the gelato they offer is excellent and i still can t get over how good their vanilla bean gelato is after all these years you really can t go wrong with either caesars wynn or cosmopolitan but if you re a crab lover like me or just want to really get the best bang for your buck make sure you hit up this place during your visit to lv
  excellent service very pleased wit our meals i had shrimp scampi alfredo pasta my sis had calamari my dish was a little to al dente for me so they re cooked it to my specifications the calamari was so good that my sis wanted to go back another day
  ive been wanting to try this place for a long time now after doing so was not happy at all i ordered the crab cakes with the hot wings the wings were great crab cake was horrible my friend tried the shrimp an grits i had to get a quick taste an yes that was horrible also an portions were very small for the price but a 10 for the wings
  worse service we had a bday there and the boss didn t even let us fridge the bday cake says it can be contaminated but yet any other restaurant would ve done it for us the food was not good we got the salmon and it literally tasted like they just added soy sauce to it my friend ordered the glazed salmon and it tasted bad for her as well the only part that we might have liked was the appetizer fish sushi not recommended and definitely my first and last time there last but not least the bill came out to 800 i could ve had better food and service at mcds
  on my recent trip to vegas social house was recommended by a friend i must say that they didn t recommend it enough every single thing we had was deliciously perfect from the spicy scallop roll to the absolutely amazing short ribs the service was excellent and neither my boyfriend nor me wanted the meal to end we could have sat there and continued eating for hours but alas vegas called
  lots of selections and pretty innovative and creative foods the food tastes good but nothing that sets it aside from the tons of sushi places here in vegas the servers here though are a bit overwhelmed and are very forgetful on what you ordered and if i ask for a refill on my soda please fill it up all the way
  came from san tan valley to see if this ny style pizza lived up to my brooklyn memories best pizza i ve tasted in the last 10 years i ordered a garlic pie to die for
  breakfast was solid my wife s brooklyn benedict was outstanding and jacob s slammer was plenty for breakfast what we also loved was the fact that we could bring our dog to the restaurant so while i probably won t be in a place to go back often i would recommend it if you are traveling through las vegas or there for a vacation
  noticed this native opened about month ago and tried it out late afternoon was not busy when we entered yet for some reason the music was set at college club loud level it was turned down after we asked yet not sure why this was noticed before the food was typical chain restaurant fair with just some differences noticed throughout the menu nothing memorable we shared a few apps a salad and with one bottle of beer the bill with tip was about 40 not expensive yet not a deal not sure if i would go back and this place is in a location that has had consistent turnover over the years so good luck
  i ve been wanting to try the gladly since it opened in the biltmore and on valentine s day my wish came true my significant other and i went here for our dinner date we had reservations and arrived a few minutes early we were seated promptly we sat in the area of the restaurant they call the library which is decorated with paintings of books and a quiet smaller room overlooking the restaurant this book aficionado absolutely loved the ambiance the menu it was pre fixed for valentine s day but we still had a good sampling of the foods offered for appetizers the boyfriend had the original chopped salad which was fantastic it s so good it even has it s own facebook page www facebook com theoriginalchoppedsalad seriously haha i am not a salad person i can t eat lettuce but even so this is something that i would order in the future i had the butternut squash soup which was warm and flavorful i loved the pepitas served on top a nice unique az style twist for dinner i had the pan seared scallops they were sweet and savory cooked to absolute perfection i love scallops and these are definitely some of my favorites they were complemented with sweet corn grits i have never had anything like this before they were so delicious i had to refrain from licking my plate we wrapped up dinner with some blueberry bread pudding i then had to refrain the bf from licking the plate for this dish haha luckily we maintained our composure and left with very satisfied bellies the portions were ample but not huge the prices were what i would expect for a fancy dinner out on the town at the biltmore we call it upper middle brow dining perhaps it s a great place for a special occasion enjoy
  i m always afraid that if i give a less than favorable yelp review of a restaurant next time i go and the recognize me they ll do something to my order but i need not worry about that at wildflower s because not only are they professionals who will listen to their customers their food is so damn good that you cannot complain i like their roast beef and gorgonzola and needless to say it is sa tis fying also check out their soups they have a location at the airport and that s where i eat when i fly out in the morning go eat here for any meal
  my coworkers decided to meet for happy hour twice this week and this was our pick for the second night of afterhours drinking this place is a lots of fun but be warned it is loud they crank up the music and it s packed so while it s a cool environment it is very hard to hear the person next to you probably not the kind of place you want to take grandma for dinner the blare a great variety of music from 311 to heavy metal to edward sharpe and the magnetic zeros the appetizers were my favorite killer onion rings and hummus my entire work team was discussing how we wanted to recreate that hummus because we want to be able to eat it all the time i ordered a black bean burger but was told it was recalled because the facility that made them had a possible had a cross contamination issue with peanuts not a big deal but i was a little bummed because that mean they bought frozen premade black bean burgers i was hoping a place like this made them fresh in house i got a quesadilla which was pretty blah i wish i had just stuck with pineapple beer and apps because that would have made an awesome meal alone i want to note that we had really great service our waitress clearly had a lot of tables in addition to our big one and she was very patient and attentive we have some dietary restrictions me the vegetarian a gluten free coworker and a vegan and gluten free coworker and she made sure every meal was made correctly and was very understanding of our needs its only 10am now and i already want to go back for more pineapple beer
  i have a love hate relationship with hash house it s always busy and i ve ordered wrong before but overall the good far outweighs the bad the one on sahara is the only one i like they had a pork roast scramble special once that i still fantasize about but for me it s mostly about the breakfast and the pancakes the blueberry pancakes are good but the banana brown sugar are amazing if you like pancakes they are the best and worth every penny the vanilla waffle is pretty blah the mashed potatoes are crazy good
  i love this place my wife and i come to this place often always order the beef mini pot with extra meat the pork dumplings are freshly made and taste so good i highly recommend this restaurant the prices are great too
  two pizza places arrived in this area of urbana recently rosati s and manolo s while i haven t eaten through the amazing range of items manolo s offers i am confident manolo s is the best of the two pizza places are ubiquitous on college campuses so i m never too excited when one springs up manolos sets itself apart by having empandas which are an excellent alternative to pizza they have several types ranging from the more authentic spicy san telmo carne to flaming potato the three types i tried were tasty and the pastry was puffy and soft they are perfect for an on the go snack since they can easily be eaten while walking as for the pizza the cheese pizza i tried was good and had a nice crust hands down the best pizza there and the reason for the recently added extra star is the fresh basil and mozzarella i had it with some friends and we all agreed it was top notch it s fragrant from the very fresh basil and the cheese stands out as being so much better than regular pizza cheese specialty pizzas are a little bizarre the one i tried creamy chicken gorgonzola was sans red sauce it wasn t bad but it was like some cheese chicken spinach and good portabellas on dough more like upscale breadsticks than pizza make sure the description says it has red sauce if you are looking for something traditional ditto the other reviewer they make their food surprisingly enough this is actually unusual many restaurants buy pre made items from big companies but here at manolos you can see them rolling the dough for all the pizza and empanadas delivery is slow and expensive pick up is the better option
  first meal on our own without the friends that we visited here in az we had to transgress from the in n out denny s mcdonalds starbucks waffle house and macaroni grill of the previous weekend and finally try a non chain establishment on the menu for us we wanted protein an order of cornbeef hash eggs and cottage cheese followed by a bacon waffle and a bowl of fruit did the trick this spot is in the asu area and has a large following from locals as it was packed service was exceptional with my coffee mug never empty and our orders executed perfectly even though we kinda made that order out of a bunch of stuff on the menu i would go back from breakfast if i lived in the area for sure
  i have to apologize to my table mate and friends i just could not stop rolling my eyes when you just could not decide what to order at restaurant l avenue i could not blame you all when i suggested we should just order a mixture of some breakfast brunch items and share and you all told me you were hungry and could eat a horse or the whole thing by yourself but you never read all these yelp reviews nor see any of the photos and on top you all ordered a smoothie each i know that smoothie alone would have filled you all up without actually eating any real food but egg benedicts were all done perfectly with such cute plating oh and those fresh fruit skewers they were staring at all these food and we don t even have enough space on the table to fit all these food enormous servings of comfort food perfect for sharing you know sharing means caring but i didn t blame them they didn t know what they were getting into the wait was not that bad 20 minute tops on a weekday yes it definitely worth the wait
  went with canada to cleo in the sls hotel great restaurant and yummy food the interior of the casino looks a bit industrial lacking ambiance and the restaurant looks right into it but otherwise atmosphere was good our server was awesome attentive informative we ordered maybe 1 2 dishes too many the server recommended 3 p carrot harissa added veggie sticks really yummy creamy waiter actually gave me the ingredients for it chopped salad refreshing tasty but had a lot left falafel yummy moist but the tahini was super salty i would avoid or have them put on side instead of bottom of plate tasted like i was sucking on a salt cube mushrooms this dish was ok a bit sweet with the balsamic cartelized i think and didn t wow me lamb tagine loved this dish apricots were a very nice touch grilled octopus delicious what really blew my mind was the shaved celery yep it was that good i would recommend would most likely return
  really great music venue nice and modern and very well thought out amazing sound lights and not a bad sight line in the house plus you can bowl between sets or even during them if you like which is always fun i came here for a work event with a talented house band playing rather than for a proper concert but i d love to come in here for a sold out show from a marquee act that i am a fan of the event i went to was fully comped but looking at the prices definitely seemed like you could go broke quick in here if you weren t careful but hey it s vegas and it s on the strip so it s really just enforcing the status quo in that regard i wish i would have gotten to try the fried chicken there was food served but it was mostly just pizza and sliders and such pretty good but nothing mindblowing next time i come here or go to either of the other existing brooklyn bowls i am definitely going to arrive early and have some chicken dinner
  steak and eggs for 3 95 yes please and no its not snack size its a hearty meal they serve only thing is it s from 12am 6am but in vegas who really sleeps anyway the food is not only cheap but it tastes good and definitely leaves you full located in south point hotel its the only restaurant they have that s open 24 hours so it s always got people no matter what time or day wait wasn t long 20 minutes at the most but the servers can do a little better they were either grumpy or forgetful i ll cut some slack only because it was 3 in the morning and they have to work but at least smile clam chowder was delicious and the burger and fries for 2 95 were just as good this is one place i ll definitely be coming back to when i hit vegas again
  amazing place we were out killing time until our dinner reservations at a different place read the reviews and had to stop in for a drink place was very busy great looking food was coming out that almost made us want to get an appetizer as other people noted on here the secret bathrooms were very cool then the toilets are kind of hidden in there too just grab the door handles when inside a must visit place if your looking for an upbeat place you want to dress up here too
  very decent bar food and always extremely quick
  i was a waiter throughout college at a nicer restaurant when i go to a pricier spot i know the key things that i m looking for stellar service and food you should not have to compromise on either when you are paying this kind of coin sw did not disappoint and this little piggy went to town on the following foods 8 oz filet w crab meat carpaccio geese fau guais forgive the spelling blue point oysters also with my dinner i had some great mixed drinks and a stellar cab anomaly i would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to spoil themselves with great service and food while they are in sin city
  prickly pear iced tea i repeat try the prickly pear iced tea right now the chai tea blew my mind might have surpassed lux s just might have tried an apple fritter ball and went to heaven okay on a serious note this is a cute little vegan coffee shop that provides vegan pastries ice cream yes to my lactose intolerant friends and food the shop is cute the two girls that were running the show behind the counter were kickin butt and takin names since they were slammed and they were super helpful to us nami virgins my husband and i we will definitely be back to try the ice cream because we kept on drooling seeing all the people walk by with these amazing looking cups nestled in their hands oh jyahhhh
  i use to live a street over from this restaurant it was a treat to go in there they are such nice welcoming people we would make it at least a weekly thing to eat there i would always get the vegetarian platter or the falafel both amazing the owner is sooo nice and his daughter is also very friendly and super sweet i haven t been here in a while thats why i gave the 4 i think a trip down there will definitely change my review
  i usually love happy hour at eb but one bartender making drinks and serving a packed bar is a recipe for disaster it was 10 min before we saw the waitress and another 10 before we had menus and water it was a good 15 min after that before we ordered eventually i got a good sized garden salad thank you for having fat free dressings but it was just lettuce and a few croutons i then had a delicious cup of mushroom soup the best part of the meal and the ahi tuna appetizer i had wasabi ginger and ponzu and an empty small dish that i can only assume was meant for soy sauce which no one ever offered along 5 6 various sized slices of tuna it was good but i wish i had some soy sauce the drinks were filled regularly and the bartender made it over once to check om us during the soup course but i didn t see her again until she was offering dessert i ve had better experiences and better food there my husband loves the lamb shanks and i live the cashew chicken but things seemed on the verge of collapsing today next time i won t sit in the bar if i am im a hurry but there are some really good happy hour food and drink options that i really like sweet potato fries overall a smidge above meh
  run i ve been a good chompie s customer for many years however just had the worst meal ever i ordered a pastrami sandwich and it was sub par it tasted like soggy fat and was extremely salty more then the usual pastrami the manager s attitude was insulting indifferent and unfriendly and couldn t care a less every table around me had some type of complaint about their food our waitress told us they have a new vendor for their pastrami and they ve had many complaints about it she explained they had to use it up before they changed vendors again lovey why should i be your guinea pig shame on you a sandwich for 14 00 should taste fabulous i would appreciate a response
  nothing wurst than a bad weenie no bun intendend but every so often i get a hankering for a hot dog a chicago hot dog at that in the windy city at milwaukee and devon sits superdawg and it is a site to behold but i ain t in the windy city i m in the hot blistering sweltering city and i didn t know where to go and then i drove down thomas and saw the vienna beef sign that was it that s what i needed the universe had answered my calling you ever enter a restaurant and immediately have the instinct that you should turn your ass around and leave quickly yea well i didn t listent to my gut cuz it was rumbling with hunger and i could smell the hot dogs steaming the place wasn t clean ok it was dirty stained floors rec room style paneling with splintering chunks of wood and vinyl chairs with duct tape hmmm still not enough for me so i get home with my chicago style dog with pepperoncini neon relish celery salt tomatoes in a soft poppy seed bun with krinkle fries ate it in 90 seconds spent the next 40 minutes in my bathroom you get the picture thank god for that reader s digest i found under the sink cuz i would have been real bored
  i wanted to love this place because it s in my backyard but i have been here multiple times and never left feeling like it was a great experience food drink and service is average but the prices are above average so they have that going for them i guess around 8pm they turn on deafening club music on the weekend so you may leave here feeling like you have tinnitus
  ok people went to los tacos today for the first time and was totally blown away having spent ten years on la mexican i learned a long time ago that the best mex comes out of very humble surroundings los tacos is no shrine but it s a serious step up from a taco truck but with truly incredible food first while standing in line i was mesmerized by the darling gal making these incredible layered seafood cocktails you know the ones loaded with shrimp octopus super fresh avocado freshly squeezed lime juice onion cilantro tomatoes then doused with liquid tomato heaven she giggled at me i must really work on this drooling problem and handed me a 1 ounce cup to sample delicious we were definitely ordering one my friend who s a regular said the rice and beans were not to be missed rice beans was she kidding and that her favorite taco was their carnitas but they have pastor and chips and salsa and then i saw the guy making their tacos and saw the guacamole omg i haven t seen guac that delicious looking in ages so it s just the two of us we order 1 taco each her carnitas my pastor the chips and salsa the rice and beans the chico sized shrimp cocktail the small is a large beer mug full she orders iced tea which she notes is freshly brewed not that crap from the coke machine and wait oh my god they have watermelon agua fresca and melon and pineapple and it s not even watermelon season but it s 85 degrees outside and i m so having one our check is 22 and change we leave them the rest and things begin to come up immediately the drinks the chips there are these bottles of green salsa on all the tables it s seriously terrific well balanced garlicy green chili tomatillo nectar perfect with their food thank god there s no salsa bar i really hate those things i realize my friend has blessed me with sharing a seriously great joint never heard of it before never even had it come up on yelp before and i m here then the tacos come can i tell you that this was singularly the best taco i ve ever eaten i got it con todos guac you wouldn t have been able to resist it either had you seen it and i m not that much of a guac lover either with cheese monterey jack melted people and sour cream ok screw the diet it came with the requisite two corn tortillas but these weren t hard and corny and tough these were delicate and the edges even a little crispy from melting the cheese on the flattop definitely homemade and the combination was so delicious i m serious i ve never had a better taco pastor people pastor but the chicken asada carnitas yes they have tongue buche all the funky stuff looked fantastic honestly i couldn t have eaten a second taco if my life had depended on it i ll definitely be back did i mention how completely fresh and perfectly delicious the sandia agua fresca was flawless perfectly great okay perhaps a bit of tequila and some lime would have made it better but hey it was lunchtime and i had to go back to work now the neighborhoooood apparently this used to be one of the hottest neighborhoods in town tony one of the first indoor malls in the country it was torn down a while ago and this joint is freestanding in the parking lot in front of a swap meet opposite a wendy s i almost feel sorry for the poor suckers eating there if they only knew hell they never will i d only go there at nighttime with friends probably wouldn t go by myself it s a little tough but not enough to deter you from going and at lunch i felt totally safe go people this is the kind of place born for yelp it rocks can t wait to go back food coma setting in now must stop typing quick update and tip food coma is now over it s 2 hours later we got there before noon and the line moved quickly but by the time we left around 12 30 there was a line out the door update 4 3 08 didn t notice the drive thru the first time tried a chicken taco this time we re talking slow cooked real chicken hand pulled big hunks of juicy white and dark meat lightly seasoned personally the pastor still wins but it s nice to see their care and quality and appreciate the fact that this food doesn t all taste the same also had a quesadilla they make them in both flour and corn tortillas wow really good forgot to say that the seafood cocktail comes with a generous basket of chips crackers and fresh lime to add to it don t forget to add some green chili sauce too
  have you ever experienced a visit to a restaurant that you wouldn t change in any way everything about donovan s was outstanding from the time we arrived to the time we left it was nonstop wonderful food ambiance and service we enjoyed crab cake appetizer it was more like a crab continent this thing was big big and full of crab meat goodness without any filler crab crab and more crab spinach salad light blend of spinach mushrooms bacon and a tangy dressing a great transition into the main course filet with shrimp scampi my filet was prepared a perfect medium rare and the shrimp were graced with a light garlic sauce that still allowed the shrimp flavor to shine through entrees come with vegetables snap peas and carrots crunchy and flavorful as well as a choice of potato we both chose baked potatoes which were garnished with all the fixin s tableside yum wine and water glasses never went empty every need seemed to be anticipated before we could even ask the team made us feel both appreciated and pampered i wish more restaurants had this type of attention to detail my only regret is we did not save valuable stomach real estate for dessert guess a return visit has to happen soon
  pretty tasty indian food some dishes were whatever like the fried okra but i got idli and my brother got dosa and both plates were cleaned the aloo bengan and chicken tikka masala are delicious as well i tried the pander tikka masala and it wasn t too great decent though overall i this place i ve been here a couple times oh and also i m indian so i would know the service is always pretty great in my experience
  super delicious the staff were great and friendly i am still thinking about the delicious polish sausage sandwich i had thanks guys keep up the great work
  i visited the station square location the second time i ever visited a buca di beppo period this past saturday for my bf s niece s 18th birthday late lunch early dinner i expected it to be on par with olive garden which i m not a fan of the commercialized italian places but i agreed with the reasoning behind going here we were a party of 11 the food is family style and there should be enough variety ordered for everyone i was actually pleasantly surprised by the entire experience first i will say we should have been seated elsewhere we were again a party of 11 that was cramped into the back corner of the basement near the bar and anytime someone had to get up to use the restroom there would be a lot of shuffling and getting up amongst everyone considering it was 3pm it was not crowded at all and we could have been sat elsewhere our server cody was very efficient constantly refilling drinks getting new plates etc for appetizers we ordered the artichoke florentine dip the fried calamari the stuffed mushrooms and the mozzarella garlic bread in particular the stuffed mushrooms were excellent the sage and rosemary flavors were very prevalent as was the artichoke dip this was just enough food to satisfy until the entrees arrived for salads we ordered an apple gorgonzola salad which was excellent but is very commonplace at restaurants currently and a mixed greens salad as for entrees the prosciutto stuffed chicken the veal marsala my favorite the sauce was sweeter than a typical marsala and paired excellently with the veal chicken and sausage ziti the sausage had a little surprising kick to it although it was supposed to be the mild sausage spaghetti with meatballs i did not sample this but looked basic minus the gigantic meatballs vegetable lasagna i did not partake in this either stuffed shells i particularly enjoyed the sausage in them we did bring our own dessert so i cannot comment on that either but i will say my expectations were far exceeded with the quality of the food since this is a chain restaurant our party also got a kick out of the decor
  upon reading all the rave reviews looking at pictures of the place and reading the menu i thought this place was a sure thing part of the problem probably was the bar was probably set too high the atmosphere was good had a great menu tomahawk steak was ok our friend s ny was way better but the kicker was our wait staff was less than average there were issues with drink orders additions checking on table and even packaging the leftovers now i would go there again but not if i am picking where we eat vegas has too many options for that price to be underwhelmed
  first time here and the food was awesome the servers were great and very attentive and helpful i loved the pork belly and bulgogi very tender the atmosphere of the restaurant was nice and warm great music and overall very chill place to hangout with friends and eat korean bbq would definitely come back again
  my wife and i had the garlic knots and 5 cheese pizza the garlic knots were tasty and a good portion the side of marinara was garnished with fresh herbs and parm cheese and went perfectly with the knots and latter the pizza crust the pizza was made perfectly with good crust and a great selection of cheeses we really enjoyed the food and the staff was friendly and helpful the yelp deals made this a great deal will eat here again one note the 5 cheese isn t sauced with a red base so if that s what you are wanting try another pizza from their selection
  their food is soooo good i can t believe all the years i ve lived here i have never seen it it s in a new york type of building on the strip tucked in me and hubby went here for our college graduation with his father the steaks were so amazing i am not even exaggerating we also had asparagus that was cooked to perfection and their gooey bubbly mac and cheese that was to die for i will be back
  very good sushi and a very good price during happy hour 2 30 6pm mon fri i think the godzilla roll was fantastic something i will get again everything we tried was very good but i think i will continue to go during happy hour
  small venue but excellent food the service was top notch it was worth the wait to be seated with a party of 8 i had the pollo slatado and my wife had the lomo slatado seasoning was not too spicy just enough to bring out the flavor in the the food when combined with the vegetables and fries paul r
  breakfast at this place is awesome great food prices and customer service unlike no other once had an issue with some bread they refunded my bread and gave me a 10 00 gift card for the trouble they also respond very well to feedback on twitter wildflowerbread one of the best dishes they have is the chicken caesar salad to die for on a hot summer day
  i have been to this place a ton of times and always had a great meal unfortunately this last time was pretty bad i bragged to my buddies how good the minestrone soup was and when we got it it was bland and a little greasy we ordered a carpaccio and instead of being raw it was like they served up medium rare roast beef i asked the server about it and he seemed kinda embarrassed because he even said he has never seen it served like that before either he took it off the bill so no harm my friend ordered a seafood pasta and he seemed pretty annoyed because they didn t clean the vein out of the shrimp to well my other buddy ordered a pasta it was a special and he said it was pretty good but nothing great i ordered the same thing i always get linguini with bolognese sauce it wasn t the same as i used to get from there it seemed very dry and almost over cooked we all agreed tho that the pasta was a perfect al dente i am let down from my last visit because it was not enjoyable and i was raving about this place to my buddies next time i will have to hit nora s
  the family and i accidentally found blt burger and boy was it a good find we were here around 2pm and there wasn t a wait the service was good and the decor was a western theme we ordered a classic burger combo tex mex burger and blt burger the classic combo was a basic cab certified angus beef patty burger and sweet potato fries the sweet potato fries had the perfect sweet and savory combo the tex mex had a cab patty jalapenos chili avocado salsa jack cheese onion and sour cream i know it sounds like a little too much going on but it wasn t it had just enough of each ingredient to taste the flavors but not overwhelm you the blt had a cab patty double smoked bacon lettuce tomato and blt burger sauce simple compared to the tex mex but still delicious the double smoked bacon was so yummy bacon makes everything better o the price was average for vegas 13 burgers and the combo was 17 it was a good meal and i have to admit blt burger has some of the best burgers i ve ever eaten i would definitely make a stop here on my next vegas trip
  happened to be in n scottsdale and was happy to find this place just across the scottsdale cave creek border actually had a friend tell me about it decided to try it for myself i got the cheese ravioli with brown butter sauce and holy cow that sauce was so good i wanted to just drink it i cook and have browned butter for a number of recipes but they did something special with this sauce wish i knew how to replicate it at home i also got the kale house salad the salad dressing was sweet and unexpected and super delish for sure lemon and maybe some honey in it it also had tomatoes and a very generous sprinkling of sliced fresh parmesan cheese and something else crunchy toasted breadcrumbs not sure but really good anyway i ll definitely be back
  their service was amazing the servers were friendly and explained the menu in great detail for us first time goers the food was a bit overpriced for my taste great customer service but a bit lacking on the food area
  i m not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from but my husband and i had an amazing time at samba we chose to try out samba s all you can eat rodizio for our anniversary dinner and we were not disappointed the sides that arrived first black beans rice glazed carrots fried sweet plantains salad bread creamed spinach were all delicious then came the meat parade all i can say is wow it seemed like each meat that came out was better than the last the only two misses for me were the pork which was quite a bit dry and lacking on the flavor and the garlic chicken legs also a bit dry and very average tasting the pineapple that came with the pork was delicious though my favorites overall were the lamb the sirloin and the chicken wings the flavors on these three were exquisite the lamb and the sirloin positively melted in my mouth even my usually hard to please husband gave samba a two thumbs up sort of review there were lots of delicious sounding drinks on the menu but we stuck with just water for dinner i would definitely recommend samba to others going to vegas and i will probably be there again on my next vacation
  this is my absolute favorite mexican restaurant in the whole valley family owned even grandma waits on tables their house margarita is great chips and salsa fast delicious and bottomless service is quick and efficient we never have to wait long it s an old and wonderful building with a unique atmosphere it s just the best i will keep coming back
  best quality for your buck manager went out of his way to show me how the online ordering menu worked
  absolutely hands down the best service i have had in a restaurant in a very long time multiple people besides our waiter stopped by our table to see what we needed and serve our food and each person knew exactly what to ask with excellent timing even the high end chef on tv restaurants in las vegas could learn from these guys i had the szechuan shrimp vegetable fried rice and crisp fried beef roll for an appetizer all were excellent and good portion size i really wanted to try a dessert but had no room left i also like the fact that between the booths is a piece of glass i didn t have to hear the conversations on either side of me nice touch
  i had the pleasure of visiting fbh with my fave foodie bear and robert a while back yeah i m behind on reviews all i can say is wow i have become a fan of fbh we walked in to a small clean space you order your yummy meal at the counter and you have to be quick to grab a table my advice grab a table then go order for my yummy meal i had the fry bread with beans and green chile i was delighted to see that i could wash my guilt ridden meal down with big red cream soda mmm when i bit into my fry bread it was crispy and light on the outside and nice and chewy in the middle it was so good i wished for a little more spice or flavor from the green chile sauce but it still did the job we also tried the chocolate and butter fry bread it was so so in my opinion but i m not much of a sweets person so definitely not a knock on fbh i will certainly visit fbh again maybe after i do a giant work out or have been fasting for 5 days it s just too good to eat on a regular basis
  this place was just a random pick because i was craving sushi thank goodness i took a chance on this place my new favorite sushi spot service was super fast and the ambience was very traditional japanese i ordered the dynamite roll and my sister ordered the jackpot roll and both were hands down ameeeeeezing i highly recommend this place and cannot wait to come back and try the fat ass roll
  1 buffet in las vegas for a good reason good service with interesting varieties of delicious food my friend and i spent a good 2 hours of eating to find one surprise after another i want to come back for more because apparently i missed some items to try eating at a nice buffet in vegas is the good life overall everything was appetizing fresh and delicious there were some highlights and few minor twilight i didn t get to try everything i wanted but i still enjoyed my meal my best tip for first timers is to get a brief tour from the waiting staff host to know where everything is someone mentioned alligator meat i gotta come back to try highlights the fresh oysters shrimp n grits lamb chop sweet potato tater tots the oysters were so rich and delicious the lamb chop was marinated and cooked to perfection the sweet potato tater tots were some sweet delicious surprise because it was glazed with either honey or maple syrup my favorite desserts were green tea mochi icecream pistachio souffle macaron and thai tea gelato yeah thai tea i enjoyed drinking horchata and mango juice that were offered by the mexican selections tip on souffle after you order the souffle best thing to do is set an alarm on your phone for 10 minutes it s all about getting it out at the right time for delicious souffle you want to get the proper timing and best result for the souffle the people working on your souffle won t forget your face in 10 minutes so just be sure to remember to pick it up and add icing pistachio was delicious twilights the few things i didn t like or did not find special were the chef special fish and prime rib i thought the chef special fish was not so special it was very bland to me and the prime rib was overcooked and did not melt in my mouth i definitely prefer wynn s prime rib more you re most likely going to have a good time eating since you re paying 50 another tip about these kind of buffet is eat very few stuff that you eat often to me chinese asian food much more of what you hardly eat like oysters lamb chop and try 1 or 2 dish that can be new to you like alligator meat
  i finally went to this place after driving by it for 8 years i would always see it and say to myself i need to go there one time but never actually following through after reading some quality reviews on here we decided to bring some family there for a graduation dinner we ordered some mussels to start and those were very good they were tender and the sauce was good we also had the caprese salad to share amongst the 4 of us i was pretty full after the appetizers so the girlfriend and i split the veal piccata it too was quite tasty the entrance is very cool with the very large and old ficus tree that had holiday lights woven through it aside from some very loud obnoxious and drunk guidos meatheads that were there it was a very enjoyable meal bonus points for giving me a healthy serving of sapphire on the rocks i will definitely be going back
  had the fish looked better then the beef
  i really enjoyed my first visit here so much in fact that i spent five hours of my time here the coffee was really good i really dug the laid back homey vibe here the patio is awesome super cozy big lots of misters i ll definitely be back and would love to try the crepes i like that it isn t obnoxiously hip too mmmmm an americano sounds good right about now
  so about 10 of us showed up last night and i think we were all disappointed on so many levels excruciatingly so i m amazed considering how highly regarded this quaint restaurant is i m hoping it was just an off night although for not a single person at our table to be remotely satisfied speaks volumes in itself we were forced into a 40 valentine s day menu that did not satisfy anyone let alone even make it to the table for some yes that s right two people from our group didn t even receive their potentially mediocre meals to give you a better idea of this mediocrity the appetizers were a joke the seafood was painfully fishy and watery the risotto was soupy and merely rice in a flavoured creamy like substance the vegan lasagna was an afterthought of random vegetables tossed in a tomato sauce the meat looked like leather need i say more i m really shocked even service was lacking and we were the largest group there forced to wait for prolonged periods of time to simply request anything all in all i spent 50 on an unmemorable meal at least the company and wine made up for its numerous shortcomings
  outstanding great service great toppings amazing concept price is right as well kudos
  great experience at the bar had a few sol cervezas and some tacos cool bartender named chris knew the area nice place to hang out
  outstanding lunch whataburger fries with spicy ketchup this restaurant is always clean and employees are helpful
  the location is great fresh brew iced tea would be welcome the menu is fine but i think that they could review what is on it and see what could be tweaked improved or refined
  good filipino fast food with a twist or fusion their meats come in tacos burritos or 2 scoops of white rice they have sisig tocino and beef steak and much more small restaurant that looks like a house from the outside facing jones not that much seating because the place is so small but it s never been packed on days that i ve gone there i had the sisig with rice and fried eggs a couple of times and it was good for fast food great place to go if you re craving sisig or filipino food in general
  after my review i haven t signed on to yelp for a very long time only to notice that chef owner had personally wrote me a sincere message regarding my experience and although i have not yet returned to monarch since its closed in the summer i m truly touched by the thoughtfulness and gesture of owner chef to make the overall experience better
  i wasn t overly impressed by this place i went in using the groupon for their breakfast and they ended up charging us tax on the full normal price why our groupon was 60 but they taxed us on 160 the full price again idk what the hell was going on but this place was just not worth it to me the only upside was the unlimited mimosas so i made sure i got my money s worth a deal that supposed to cost 25 a person ended up as 45 so pretty much you re paying the full normal price just to get free cheap alcohol also it was breakfast only so the food was very mediocre i don t blame groupon at all because this was simply the misleading doings of baccanal s buffet if i m gonna spend 30 on a meal again i ll do it at all you can eat sushi not for some salad few claws eggs and toast maybe i ll come back when they have a real deal that is not misleading during their dinner times but until then i don t think i ll ever return it s just not worth the money at all
  i ve gotta say i used to be one of this place s biggest cheerleaders but something has happened i took my wife there for our anniversary tonight and while everything was fine it was just fine and not great and i feel bad because this place used to hit it out of the park every time for a while after they opened one or both of the owners or the people we perceived to be the owners paul and bob were there every time we were in the last few times we ve been in they ve not been there and something is clearly missing we also don t see any of the other servers from their heyday i tried to subtly interrogate the service to see if the place had changed hands but no one came clean at the end of the day the food was fine but honestly i can cook a more flavorful filet at home they also ruined the shrimp grits app by putting vegetables into it and replacing the brown butter with some weird soup stock it s shrimp grits i don t expect it to be healthy their dessert menu was paltry compared to the days of yore they re clearly changing things they re doing lunch now they ve added a bunch of draft beers although as a beer guy all relatively pedestrian choices but these changes have come at the expense of some intangible magic from the first couple years this place was open i hate to say it but this place is a shadow of its former self
  i guess i can t understand why the men aren t allowed to wear sleeveless shirts at an outdoor beach themed bar but the servers aren t required to wear pants we had a drink before dinner and tried to return afterwards and the security team rudely refused us entry do to our attire normally i would understand but when we were already in the building less than 2 hours before seems kind of ridiculous there s a way to handle this kind of situation and this bar did not handle it in a way that would make me want to come back disappointing
  was not impressed with my too oily tasteless shrimp meal i walked out wishing i went to chili s
  the beer is very unremarkable and very disappointing food is good but overpriced if you want beer birdsong brewing and noda brewing are just up the street and both are leaps and bounds better especially birdsong if you want food there is a myriad of options also just up the street that are again better if this was the only option around i d return but there are much more worthwhile places to spend my money here in the neighborhood
  so many haters but really this place is kinda awesome in a city full of sin how can you settle for anything less total dudes place much akin to hooters i admire the great risk that the owner took to bring it here but of course well i m a self proclaimed fatass i didn t have problems with the extra extra friendly spanking service this place is damn unique quadruple bypass champ yep you heard it i downed the 8000 calories in one sitting sure the 270 mile ride home wasn t fun but you gotta pay to play most might say so much quantity that it can t possibly taste good but let me tell you the tastiness of the patty is really what got me through this it s no frills cooked to tenderness perfection with a slathering of cheese melted on no charcoal mess no gimmicks just good ol food my technique was to divide and conquer where i essentially made 2 doubles when i knocked down that tower of meat the sense of accomplishment was monumental i looked over at my partners burgers and juices were just spilling down but my plate no messy droppings all technique at the end of the meal i was wheeled out to my car in a hospital robe by my buxom nurse server i was king of the world this day king of the toilet that night
  such a great little coffee shop tucked away in point breeze it might be easy to miss this place if you are not looking but the coffee is fair trade the workers are super nice and there are papers on the wall which come from patrons who are encouraged to draw come by and check it out
  fun trendy restaurant with great food smalls are appropriately named luis our busboy was really knowledgeable and friendly great place we ve already recommended it to our friends
  i got a groupon for mellow mushroom wanting to try it out after hearing good reviews of the pizza when we got there we were seated quickly and got asked by two different people if we wanted drinks after getting our drinks we ordered our food and that s where the good feelings quickly changed while the pizza itself was good the service was by far the worst i have ever experienced our waitress didn t return for over 45 minutes between when she placed our order and brought the check not once did she check on us to make sure everything was good or to see if we needed anything i had to ask one of the busboys for a refill on my drink because the waitress never bothered to come by or to the other two tables by us i had high hopes for my big out but after this experience i won t be back perhaps just takeout if i m in the mood for the pizza
  definately will pick this buffet place over tin tin for these reasons price is worth what you pay for and will cost less then tin tin less variety more quality food great sushi selection you will find sushi rolls at this place that you will not find at other chinese buffets and you won t be disappointed the sushi here are way more quality then other places i love their seafood stir fry dish with the shrimp and crab meat love their jello great service they are always refilling your drink sometime way sooner then you want them to
  a very nice sushi place my 2nd favorite in all of vegas they are not as fast as they should be but the sushi has always been yummy and we always come back
  apps and dinner were fabulous steak was cooked to perfection and lobster was exquisite service was awesome we ll be back soon
  my new addiction after a workout at orange theory i come here for a acai banana berry bowl or the pb bowl great stuff wi fi and happy helpful workers complete the experience
  this place does not need to exist period
  get there early cause its supper busy also ask for the sides to come with dinner or else u eat them before your meal mmmm crab mmmm clams in the everything sauce is bomb yes i am a fan service was a bit everywhere but they were great love the tv s that are everywhere and have everything on my little one watched sponge bob so that helped entertain her for the meal it is messy prepare people it s a mess down there don t wear anything nice you will get sauce or lime or something on you that day night
  thank you for the diarrhea don tortacos basically we came here after jf and i ordered the carne asada fries the price was the same as everywhere and the actually plate wasnt lovely nor was it delectable i hate the carne asada here it was over cooked and no bueno customer service was decent and they have a little salsa bar the next morning i wanted to die it was horrid no mas tortacos
  i am a big fan of pupusas i first got introduced to this restaurant at the eastern location i have been going for about 10 years but it s a far drive from where i live so when they opened this one in the northwest i was excited the food is just as good but the service isn t so great we didn t get the water we ordered we had to remind the waitress and we got totally ignored when we wanted the bill went up to the register to pay and was ignored again food took a long time waitress only checked up on use once so overall great food and terrible service otherwise i d give the 5 stars
  wallah saved the best review for last as i catch up on writing reviews tonight i m customer 3339 yes each guest that dines at this restaurant gets their own number makes you feel kinda special i guess we got lucky with getting reservations here exactly a month in advance so it must ve been meant to be each seating only seats 8 guests 2 seatings a night i ve been to alinea in chicago few years ago so i knew what to expect i think i may have actually enjoyed e by jose andres a slight more maybe because it was more interactive and intimate experience because you sit in a curved table watching the chefs semi prepare your meals the amount of prep work the chefs had to do to orchestrate the 20 courses was quite remarkable the details and intricacy of each dish was impressive astericks tagged next to dishes i really enjoyed 1 rebujito alcoholic drink they stirred up and topped with foam reminded me of this drink i had at the lobby lounge at the modern formerly called edition hotel in hawaii 2 spanish clavel beautifully shaped into a flower and served in the palm of jose andre s hand tasted like candy 3 beet jewelry they said to eat it off your pinky finger like a ring dusted with gold tasted like beet chips with a savory sweet taste 4 caramelized pork rinds ehhh wasn t too into this 5 apple brazo de gitano light airy texture and sweet we were confused why it seemed like it was starting out with dessert like courses 6 nitro almond cup wow this was genius it looked like half an egg shell with caviar and cream in it the chef said to eat it quick because it will melt so i put the whole thing in my mouth quite a surprise 7 crispy chicken skin in escabeche not a chicken skin fan but this was quite delicious tender chicken on crispy skin topped with foam 8 jose taco caviar wrapped in proscuitto nothing special it was as you could imagine 9 olivia sferica ferran adria olive juice in a bubble so it pops in your mouth and tastes like an olive they process to make this sounded quite intricate 10 bocata de calamares similar to the sandwich but of course with a twist it had a huge piece of sweet uni from santa barbara 11 cava sangria a shot of alcohol in the same bubble like thing as the olive whew woke me up 12 artichoke puree with vanilla it looked like sato imo small japanese mountain potatoes but it was little artichokes never had anything like that it was in a nice dark sauce with lemon foam dressed on the side 13 lobster with citrus and jasmine foam my favorite i love lobster and jasmine so pairing the two was heaven the dish was beautifully plated with citrus segments 14 chickpea stew with iberico ham this was a pretty dish you just wanted to just stare at and not eat this was a favorite amongst the entire table it was like a delicate cream stew with garbanzo dumpling like things 15 turbot with bone marrow the moist white fish had a crispy skin and was complimented well with grounded coffee grinds on the side the chef was raving about the bone marrow filled pockets but it was nothing special for me 16 rosemary wild mushrooms in papillote wrapped in a cellophane bag this was like a mushroom soup with scents of rosemary then topped with foam again one of the guest had a substitute of veal cheeks since he doesn t like mushrooms so we were all quite envious of that dish 17 secreto of iberico pork with squid loved the pork and sauce this dish once again topped with some green vegetable foam still not over yet can t forget about the desserts 18 orange pith puree la serena spooned goat cheese plated with sauces and thin piece of bread 19 flan beautifully plated with four small pieces of flan and flowers and mint with shaved ice in the middle drizzled with caramel i enjoyed watching them making this one 20 pan con chocolate was the least attractive dish but what a treat my favorite dessert course top looked like it was sprinkled with dirt but it was chocolate cake that melts in your mouth layers underneath had crunch which gave it texture to the creaminess of the dessert 21 arroz con leche arroz con leche in a cone made with melted sugar kicks of citrus 22 25 second bizcocho they said it took only 25 seconds to make this cake like volcano in the microwave similar to a chiffon cake very light dusted with gold 23 fizzy paper crispy paper like candy but wakes you up with the strong citrus flavors 24 air chocolate just like the name airy chocolate one that was bitter dark and the other yogurt flavored yes we felt like we ate enough food that could last a week in our tummies but the memories would last for a long time
  we were traveling thru town and wanted indian food we definitely were not disappointed the butter chicken tika masala and chicken tika were very tasty we had an ample amount of food with great naan the service was very friendly and attentive would definitely recommend this restaurant
  just ate there this past week and this was my 3rd visit to b b every time i ve been here it s been nothing short of excellent i booked a reservation for six online just one day in advance for a monday night the hostess greeted us and sat us immediately the waiter came by quickly greeted us and then sent over the sommelier the staff was very knowledgeable about each of the dishes and our waiters recommendations were perfect we did quite a bit of sampling but some of the highlights for the antipasti would be the grilled octopus the caramelized fig salad and the caprese salad as for the primi and secondi i recommend the beef cheek ravioli gnocchi with lamb ragu and mint and the short rib the bottom line as someone who frequently travels north america and dines out regularly this restaurant is easily in my top 5 and has made its way into my list of restaurants i must go to on all future las vegas trips i highly recommend it
  my trip to the le village buffet can be summed up in one word prime rib i ve been reading a number of the reviews on here and not a lot of positive is being said about it but for some reason when a group of 6 of us made our way into the le village buffet the prime rib was the toast of the table it was juicy succulent and would fall apart just by cutting it with the side of your fork also we checked out prime rib at the buffets at both the rio and planet hollywood and they paled in comparison the selection here was not worldly but it did offer a variety of good desserts and there were a number of vegetarian options for those in our party that had to avoid the meaty goodness another standout was the omelette bar which had a ton of options and really was surprisingly good our server debra was very polite and kept our bottomless mimosas full we went on sunday for brunch where apparently it is always free she made us smile for le village buffet anytime is prime time
  singha beer googgle effect yeah this is a fun place that s got an edgy hip vibe but the food is a basic rendition of standard thai fare it tastes good but these dishes done properly should also because thai food generally tastes good when you are drunk or hung the perfect combo of grease salt and carbs it serves the target demographic well not trying to be negative i ve had several perfectly fine meals here just giving a realistic assessment sober diners and those who know food should adjust expectations accordingly on the plus side service has always been great
  this place was great for being open at 1 o clock in the morning and for the value of the food we had the eggs and steak and hashbrowns for five dollars which is a fantastic deal we did have a trouble ordering a beer for some reason it confused the staff we waited quite a while for the food but we had no complaints given it was so late and we were so hungry the value and the atmosphere were good one thing i would not recommend if you are sensitive to smoke there was a lot of cigarette smokers inside the casino food quality was really only 3 5 stars
  they just never fail to satisfy i ordered the corn chowder once again and it was delicious we ordered to bowls to split three ways in which they divided equally for us i ordered their shrimp and grits which was also amazing and i m not a big fan of grits the grits were creamy and sweet and the prawns were huge my dad ordered the angus burger which was also delicious and is also rated as las vegas best angus burger it had blue cheese and all the fixings we requested patio seating since the weather was lovely out so we got to admire the wonderful landscape of the golf course you just gotta love that 18th hole with the waterfall they also turned on the heater as soon as it started to get chili they also have special winter menu out right now that included eggnog and gumbo there s more to it and i promise i ll update that as soon as i remember which also seemed like a really good menu given the season of course chef had to add his new orleans creole flare into it service was on point as usual with that positive attitude ensuring your glass is always full
  strip house is undoubtedly good and one of the top steak houses in vegas however i just don t know if i d return everything was cooked very well our service was on the spot and the ambiance was posh and comforting but i just didn t get the wow factor we go through the motions with our server tap or bottled and let him know tap is fine order two glasses of wine and were served bread all very standard in fine dining restaurants blah upon the arrival of our wines we order our first course of either crab cakes or scallops can t remember and a caesar salad we continue on the order our entrees a 16 oz ny strip and a 10 oz filet mignon we also ordered three sides whipped potatoes puree potatoes romanoff and black truffle creamed spinach our first courses arrived in a timely manner the salad was fresh but wasn t the best i ve ever had and as far as i know with the seafood it was decent nothing to rave about shortly after finishing them our steaks and sides arrive and are cooked near perfectly the ny strip was juicy and flavorful and even though my filet was cooked medium the way i wanted it was a tad on the dry side with little flavor our sides were very good but perhaps a little on the heavy side my favorite being the whipped potatoes puree the spinach was very rich creamy and flavorful though i don t recommend ordering it unless you have at least four people in your party the potatoes romanoff was rich as well with a vast amount of cheddar cheese and sauteed onion again i wouldn t recommend ordering this unless your are dining with at least a group of four too much food strip house has a beautiful luxurious red interior which is reminiscent of a 1920s red light district there are tons of artsy burlesque ish pictures of girls hanging from the walls for those of you who are dining alone they do have a nice bar upon entering the restaurant equipped with a large flat screen to watch the games be aware there is music spinning however the music is of a modern retro beat that is very easy to listen to somehow the music fits the vibe of the restaurant since most of the clientele is between the ages of 20s 40s this is definitely a restaurant to be seen in but like i mentioned above the food just didn t give me the wow factor
  i m constantly pleased by the quality of food coming from here and am never let down when it comes to service as a tip if you place your order to go make sure you keep the containers as they are quite durable and reusable to take your lunch to work in as for the amount of food you receive i bet you can always have 1 2 or a little less left over for another meal 90 of the time
  i ve had the pleasure of coming to this establishment since back in the days and it has never disappointed some of my favorites have always being the boca burger w a powerlift smoothie that always hits that special spot make sure to come by and give this little coffee pub a try because for me is being always a great treat
  first time to this location clean area good food and great service the manager was great and helpful we are so glad there is a convenient place for us to eat now thanks again dean
  will definitely have to go back for another try we hit it on a tuesday they were packed and not prepared for the crowd one waiter for both inside and outside the misters outside were pooling on my table the food was amazing we had the shaking beef and i tried everyone s spring rolls and pho the lychee mojito yummy it was a good sign to be so busy but hope they learn by their mistakes i would love to go back and sit inside it was so cute in there have a feeling i could rate it 5 stars if i could sit inside ps we had to park across 7th st their private lot in the back was full and a cab blocked our way to get through it
  great place to go to for lunch the food is decent nothing special however their shakes are really good and you can always tell that the food is fresh
  great bar menu cheap scotch awesome beer selection definitely a great place to have drinks just make sure you eat before you come they have the worst food ever i honestly don t understand how they ve received a single award for their food it s always bland or weird and usually over cooked i d grab a cocktail here any day but i d get a pizza delivered if i got munchy
  been here a million times will be back a million more great food divey so don t expect great ambiance extremely affordable can t go wrong with any dish
  greek food has a special place in my heart this place had some of the gratifying bittles despite it being fast food we found it by accident when we were planning on eating at the fantastic greek restaurant stefano s in the same shopping center we were saddened when we found out that stefano s is closed on sunday but this was definitely the next best thing i wavered between 3 4 stars on this one let s start with the positives fresh ingredients speedy service negatives only 1 worker on weekends the food was good but not great i would recommend this place if you are craving a gyro and need something quick even with only 1 worker she was very fast and very courteous if there was some hummus not just chips to go with this then i would have probably given them a solid 4
  just had lunch there with my wife and enjoyed every minute the service was excellent my wife has some food restrictions and they were accommodating my wife forgot to tell them about one her restrictions and did not remember until after the food was at our table the server took care of it in no time at all the food was really good pricing was good i recommend that you try this bistro
  over a hundred beers on tap but i could only make my way through three of them most unfortunate i will have to return my waitress was really cool with me taking up a table for three for two hours because my friends apparently don t know how to read a clock very well while i waited i had a snack sampler of hummus which was excellent and loaded in garlic the beers were nice and cold if perhaps a little spendy at 6 each nice restaurant to hang out and to meet up with friends i really enjoyed it
  i tried this place for the first time today and i really liked it i went through the drive through which was a little slow but the sandwich i got the chicken cheese and turkey was totally worth the wait i ll be back to try their breads and pastries
  i ve been coming to manna for a couple of years now and can say it is one of the best mediterranean food places in vegas consistently great food and service highly recommend
  besides the yummy food like my favorite gyro and split pea soup they have i enjoy there friendly customer service you can tell that that their kindness is real and down to earth good to eat inside or for take out
  turkey burger best anywhere i ve been going here for years whenever i am in the area i have to eat there the 2 go take out service is really good but for some reason the wait staff not so much still hands down one of my fave places to go for a burger and fries this is not in n out mmmm
  love this place me and my boyfriend come here all the time from 25 mins across town good vegetarian options for me and my boyfriend loves the souvlaki combo which i believe comes with one steak and one chicken skewer with rice and other sides too big portions and friendly family run staff
  i felt like i was back in nyc a panel high on the wall with photos of all the dishes tiny sketchy place i got a chimichanga and by god it was one of the fattiest things i ve eaten in my life scratch one more restaurant off the bucket list
  had a pretty good dinner here the other night wish they had a couple of different salsas the one they have is really hot and i like hot but it was to hot it would also be nice if they gave you a small bowl for salsa when you order and pay for the chips and salsa the tiny one ounce to go container is kinda hard to eat chips and salsa out of the chips were homemade and tasty the beans were really good and the fresh flour tortillas are awesome pretty disappointed in the enchilada the tortilla was really tuff and i wish i had a knife to cut through it also the sauce was not very good this is a quick easy place to grab decent fast mexican food will be back for a bean and cheese burrito for sure
  i love the food there it is under new ownership and the food is great taste and quality we have eaten there often and will go back
  wow this place is overly hyped i still love the food here but in no way is it as good as the bayside buffet at mandalay bay or the one at the mirage
  lunch special with lechon and pancit was very good portion size was small compared to other filipino restaurants
  good mexican food i had the enchiladas with rice and beans tasted good a little on the spicey side kind of small could ve been bigger good service
  love love love the truffle fries they are a must try we had them 3 times during our stay in vegas
  i got the prime selection ribeye steak medium rare for 36 the sweet spot was about the size of a silver dollar and the rest of the steak was fat and tough meat my sisters got the prime rib and filet both were exceptionally good the service was good too
  we had two very good meals here yes it is a landry s chain and as you would expect chain restaurant food but its still good we had one rather rude server the first night but everyone else was outstanding the bucket of boat trash with crab clusters shrimp and fish with cajun seasoning was amazing nothing tasted fishy service was fast and the food came out hot only other glitch was food runners brought out the food and apparently did not look at the ticket as we had to ask our waiter about my meal but he got it for us right away and it was still hot and fresh
  let me start by saying that i ve eaten at some pretty incredible places in vegas spent a lot more money than i did here but i absolutely enjoyed myself at scarpetta just as much at a fraction of the cost everything was spot on for our visit despite having made last minute reservations we requested and received a booth where all four of us could see the fountains the appetizers were amazing we tried the pea soup polenta scallops and short ribs for entrees two of us had the duck and foie gras ravioli which i will be dreaming about for a long time the aged sirloin and the spaghetti one of us had dessert yeah that would be me a coconut panna cotta in a guava soup perfect my only complaint the wine prices they are in a word astronomical i expect to pay double retail prices usually maybe a bit more in vegas but scarpetta is at least quadruple so my husband chose beer and i went with two glasses of wine and called it a day rather than having to sell myself on the strip for a bottle
  restaurant has a very hip and trendy atmosphere which is great for going to before the club i enjoyed myself the lemon chicken dish i had when i was there great cocktails my only hesitation on this restaurant would be how the it is set up i don t like how it s real boxy and divided up inside and the bar is horribly placed but beyond that i try to make it a monthly spot
  excellent friendly knowledgeable staff delicious good quality teas easily customizable milk soy almond milk level of sugar large small or mixed sized tapioca different jellies either hot or cold large and varied selection all very well priced it is a spacious and lovely environment i highly recommend this place
  ate here about a month ago when i had an intense gyro craving this place fit the bill but was nothing to write home about just good greek food
  filling portions decent prices gyros meat was a little over cooked burgers are like a sweet burger king burger i d go back but wouldn t go out of my way to eat here
  wow what an experience but unfortunately not for the good i came in not for the cheap lunch specials but to order a complete lunch 4 my wife and myself war wonton soup featured flavorless balls of chalky wrapper not cooked through leaving a nasty chewy doughy texture waiting to get spit out the wonton broth didn t seem fresh but more like powdered bouillon mix and bits of carrot and celery thrown in let me know if im wrong the kung pao scallops were absolutely pathetic when the water chestnuts are larger then the scallops you already have a problem the scallops were worthless pieces of rubber band after i bit two pieces and spit them both out i asked the waiter to try a scallop and he kind of grinned because he knew they were old i asked him to taste the scallops and he just laughed me off i m used to shitty service at very good chinese restaurant but this was not the case my wife ordered the flaming steak and after trying to slice this piece of leather and not finding a single decent piece to slice off due to grissle tendon and connective tissue i pulled out my spyderco to cut through bamboo cafe cafe advertises choice steaks but this piece of cow was obviously less then select by the lack of marbeling advanced gristle and tendon throuout we left over 95 of the steak on the table and was waiting for the waiter maitre d to ask us what was wrong with the steak sadly and pathetically that question never came if you order a steak at a restaurant and the customers are not eating it should you not ask what the fuck is wrong with it my wife reminded me we had a coupon for buy one entree get one free so we ordered the pan fried noodles to go i brought it home for my mother in law what a final insult so salty my chinese mother in law thought i was insulting her i was ashamed to have offered this to her in 48 years i have never left a zero tip i actually went to taco bell to get the taste of this shitty chinese food out of my mouth i found the service lacking and unprofessional perhaps the help wanted sign on the front door will find a real chinese cook but pity that chef if the owners continue to serve up the lowest quality ingredients to make a buck for those customers who claim this is the best the finest or even decent chinese food shame on you i am not going to give one star because it will be eliminated i will simply give 2 stars and you can read this review for what it is thank you
  any good buffet has a wait which should be an hour or so but on our visit there was not one person in line at 4pm it s a small buffet with a a mediocre size selection and variety i have to agree with some of the reviews a lot of the stuff in the pictures is nowhere to be found the best thing served at this buffet is the mac cheese station and the guys where so nice you can have all types of ingredients from bacon ham sausage and many more fixings made to order and very scrumptious i also think that for the price the crab legs should be hot and the guy behind the counter didn t even offer to heat them for us all in all it s an ok buffet but way over priced
  horrible bar service all draft beers are out on a saturday not worth the stop
  the service wasnt that good good place but didnt like the people working there my first time there and its gonna be the last one
  great food concept in a fun little restaurant space unfortunately the staff are slightly inexperienced but the experience is more than compensated by the kitchen staff which are top notch tip try the huevos rancheros
  i remember when this place first opened i absolutely loved eating there there was a sushi chief named jack who made it experience very fun however these last couple times i have gone i ve been very disappointed the sushi has tasted and looked awful like tonight i ordered a spicy tuna roll the roll looked like complete shit it was sloppy overly stuffed with tuna and not enough rice on top of that it tasted horrible
  o h s o bland this place is in such a beautiful industrial space but it s so boring it really lacks personality which given the concept and building is so easily capable of achieving of course the beer selection is great they snuck the sam adams boston lager onto their menu which i think is a wonderful beer but not appropriate in the grand selection at o h s o i found the patio furniture they had near the cool garage doors was a bit tacky i don t think this is a permanent location for this bar but i think they could ve done a better job with decor and furnishings the service was fine as were the beers
  it s a very very good pizza been their 3 times the only draw back is very dark in the parking lot
  i was really excited to try the crepe area the line wasn t too long and moved quick the pretzel rolls really good why waste buffet room on bread i know but trust me on this two kinds of macaroni and cheese people plenty of desserts to tempt your taste buds
  california enchilada was the best ever work with a cop who said i had to visit this place when i went to az and he was sooooo right went to school in texas so i thought i d tried some really good enchiladas but these are my new faves don t miss out
  tried their delivery for the first time and will not order from them again food arrived with sauce from spaghetti leaking into the bag and all over some of the other food meatballs on the spaghetti were good but the pasta was overcooked and the sauce just tasted like tomato sauce out of a can wings were undercooked garlic bread had very little taste pointless to eat it however the salad was tasty with lots of meats cheese olives and peppers we didn t try the pizza but based on this experience we won t be back to barros
  i cannot thank bettina vita sima chef marcellino and the entire staff enough for the memorable meal we had saturday night we wanted to celebrate my mother s birthday and last minute like typical italians they accommodated our party of seven and got us in rolled out the red carpet and arranged for us to enjoy the private room if you want great wine great service beautiful ambiance all while enjoying the most to die for hand crafted pasta don t walk but run to marcellino s just be sure to make a reservation because you will never be as lucky as we were especially if it is high season everything on the menu is worth it worth the money worth the carbs and worth the calories you only live once enjoy
  perfect friendly place for families only no changing tables but it s made up by the friendly staff thanks tyler for your awesome service
  i ve read all the reviews for this food truck and decided to try it out for myself when i walked up to the truck i was greeted warmly by the owner and chef and when i got my food wow incredible flavor and complexity to these korean tacos i experienced a multitude of sensations like savory sweet spicy crunchy juicy all in one bite and then there were crazy s sweet dough they remind me of hawaiian malasadas except smaller they were soo oo delicious and sweet keep up the great work hanshik taco i don t see where the negativity from other reviews apply here stop hating people
  i can only imagine this goodness gets better when drunk but for my hungover boyfriend and i it cured all wounds we ordered a smorgasbord more food than either of us should consume on a single day probably i with the cheese enchilada plate and he with the carne asada wet burrito and the both of us with carne asada street tacos and chips and cheese with guac the guacamole was probably the least good part of the meal the dreaded watery avocado paste but the rest of the meal was delish i had never been to any roberto s funny living in vegas for a while and having lived in southern california as well but i enjoyed myself it s interesting how accustomed i get to places like chipotle and cafe rio and then once i get to a place like this it s at once awesome and disappointing i want queso i want chunky avocados but then i m like wait this is better actually and probably with less terrifying ingredients open 24 hours for all those drunken late night cravings
  this is the best thing i have ever put in my mouth a common sentence used when nickole and i dined here last monday christine the bartender is awesome and made the best recommendations for us started our meal off with a house margarita on the rocks with salt made up of hurradurra tequila fresh squeezed lime and agave syrup it was so good nickole had a white peach margarita and that was amazing as well for an appetizer we had the tiger shrimp tamale wow honestly the best thing i have ever eaten with garlic corn and a cilantro sauce that makes you want to cry this tamale was sculpted by gods i swear i could eat this dish every day drink 2 pear margarita yum not too sweet but with a slight hint of pear very good and strong for the entrees we both split the smoked shrimp tacos and ancho chili honey glazed salmon wow x2 the tacos were perfection with grilled corn tortillas and a cabbage slaw the shrimp being so juicy and perfectly marinated this dish was to die for the salmon was perfect too cooked at a medium temp and on a bed of a house made black bean sauce and a cilantro oil the honey glaze complemented the salmon perfectly both amazing choices drink 3 pomegranate martini a little on the strong side but pretty good desert sticky toffee cake being gluten free i only had a small bite to try it and if my allergy was mild and wouldn t cause me severe pain i would have eaten the whole thing wow was it good and with a side of house made ice cream it was truly the cherry on top to our meal i highly recommend this place to everyone it will not disappoint i cant wait to come back
  solid healthy meal was enjoyed at this location the large bowl was only 7 and the white meat chicken was very good quality and was plentiful needed an extra teriyaki sauce but will get that next time could use more veggies but overall a great choice
  worst chinese food ever waited over 90 min for delivery to hotel then absolutely nothing tasted like it should have kung pao chickens only vegetable was 2 pieces of broccoli and it tasted like sweet sour chicken would never recommend
  staff and ambience are amazing italian stallion and stuffed shrimp are a must i work down the street from here and we get it once a week
  i don t know how i ve never reviewed postino before it s definitely my go to for date night or girls night they have great specials including the infamous 20 bottle board deal on mondays and tuesdays after 8pm if you can make it for lunch or early happy hour they also offer 5 glasses of wine until 5pm my favorite bruschetta toppings are the brie apple fig and the goat cheese roasted red pepper the smoked salmon pesto is worth noting as well when i m in the mood for something lighter i usually go for the mixed greens salad with pear candied nuts gorgonzola and a light vinaigrette the only reason i docked a star is because i m not a fan of the parking situation it s extremely limited and while they have valet i wish there was a way to offer more free parking
  i think the food here is as good as any indian in pittsburgh i e it s as good as taste of india prices are a little higher than taste of india s however today my kids and i had channa batura bread chicken tandoori chicken pepper fry navaratna kurma and mango lassi all were excellent my complaints the restaurant was cold 60 degrees and the waiter was unable to do anything about it this is on a day when it was 20 degrees outside service was slow our first dish the bread took at least 20 minutes tables are a bit small
  brilliant is the least one can tell about tamarind have been here for more than a year and each time it has been a very pleasant experience especially if you are a cmu or pitt student close by definitely suggest you try it out
  they ve done away with their paper table ordering we heard every table around us ask for it on monday only to hear over and over the new ownership has done away with it both myself and my husband had fried rice as our base there were several clumps of completely white rice in our dish several veggies such as onions and celery felt like they hadn t been grilled at all we really used to like this place but both agreed we won t be going back
  the food has been better i did takeout the menu changes aren t necessarily better my changs spare ribs were just northern style ribs with bbq sauce on them so salty i ate one and threw them out the orange peel beef always a go to for me now has orange segments yuck the pork fried rice had clumps of white rice barley any stir fry sauce and zero flavor for almost 40 we had a very disappointing dinner i went to pfchangs com and filled out a comment and never heard a response from them poor customer service oh how they ve changed it seems like mgt there is a little goofy these days as well something s up with phillips place the bartender alexis was the best part of my experience having a drink while waiting for my food
  i would always go to yen because after hitting up every sushi joint in town they were always fantastic and their happy hour was phenomenal until one day we saw this little hole in the wall sushi joint next to the liquor store called sushi catcher happy hour all day incredible prices for even some rolls that i ve seen for 7 more at other places and the staff is friendly courteous helpful and fun twice a week i need to eat their vegas rolls no other local joint makes vegas rolls like this try this place
  great kids meals super fresh mango salsa is the best and staff is friendly overall great value although pricier than most mexican restaurants
  say what you will about arizona restaurant week the crowds the not regular diners dining out etc but it got us to try crudo and wow will we be going back first some location observations hard to find since there is not good signage on indian school second lovely upon walking into restaurant but what is the very strong smell of wood smoke it dissipated as we went into restaurant but still odd my date and i were not seated at an empty booth for two but by a table of 10 and a table of 6 where a young couple with their baby came in shortly after we started eating really folks i get that you want to have a life once you have children but don t bring your fussy crying one year old out to a finer establishment at 7 pm on a saturday night i work too hard to earn my dining dollars get a sitter or stay home okay enough soapbox waiter was friendly was great about explaining the wine and the dishes here s what we had albacore crudo with apples truffle black garlic one of the most amazing dishes i ve ever had butterfish crudo with tomatoes arugula also outstanding mushroom mozzarella truffle egg a great melange of various mushrooms melted mozz truffle oil and a fried egg heavenly short rib grilled root veg mashed potatoes and horseradish comfort food elevated to a new level dessert tracy dempsey s flourless chocolate cake with hazelnuts creamy decadent in fact i m going to go finish my leftovers of it now and dream of next time i can get back to crudo
  my boyfriend and i went to this place because we wanted barbecue we shared the barbecue trio plate the food was edible but not great and it ended up making us both sick too bad because our server was nice but definitely won t be coming back to eat here again
  pretty typical mcalisters
  horrible place had their coctel de elote and got some canned yellow corn hope it was a bad night singers were drunk as hell or they sounded like it couldn t get the guts to try anything else thank god its in the back hidden no one should endure this pain
  solid italian restaurant nothing fancy or special just the classic staples we usually get pizza for take out from here and it s definitely good but not the best i ve had overall i would recommend it
  i really enjoyed the pumpkin pancakes which were massive and fluffy i don t know what service is like at the tables but sitting at the counter everything came out rapidly our coffee cups were always brimming our food flew out of the kitchen and everything was delicious if you dig diner food and aren t intimidated by lady servers with neck tattoos put this place in your date book killer homefries
  i do not typically write reviews but i was extremely disappointed with this place to be short and sweet you can find better a lot better they were surprisingly short staffed for a saturday night after a mercury game dbacks game so we waited a long time for our food we both ordered pizzas my crust was completely burnt when i told the waitress she merely took it away and did not offer me anything else horrible horrible service all in all don t waste your time here you deserve better
  zen is our go to place for local sushi and chinese food extremely fast and all around awesome everyone is very nice and kind the online ordering is very good as well pickup times from them are about 10 minutes so if you need a fast and healthy bite this is the place to go
  a friend and i went into this establishment on a sunday they had no seats available as there were large parties they were accommodating there was a hustle and bustle about the waitress and host after about ten minutes we were seated i asked about the egg fu yung and its sauce he mentioned that there were two different sauces and asked which one i wanted i told him the new york style then all of a sudden he told me that they were out of egg fu yung after he asked me what i wanted he said that they were out of egg fu yung i know how to cook egg fu yung and it s just a few ingredients mixed in egg anyway i told him that we needed a minute to make up our mind i didn t like the vibe of the restaurant maybe because it was so busy and the waiter seemed rushed i really wanted my eg fu yung so i asked the lady waiter why they weren t serving it she told me that they didn t have time to cook it they were busy what the heck that was a first for me as i have never just been told they a restaurant doesn t feel like cooking your order i dislike this place and will never go back
  the worst food i had the bbq mix plate and the chicken and teri beef had no taste and the kalbi had a weird smell like it was borderline spoiled
  after watching a ton of his shows on tv i ve been wanting to try some of his signature items to see if he lives up to his reputation this is one of his vegas flagships it was my first time here but hubby had been here before and loved it trendy decor and cute story about going through the chunnel from paris to london when you re being seated excellent service at the table the hostesses aren t the most consistent but the table service is excellent nice explanation of the menu and steak cuts these are the highlights and what i would definitely recommend getting beef wellington it s the signature item and sooo good the layers are perfect and the meat inside is incredibly flavorful sticky toffee pudding another classic dish that totally lived up to the hype definitely good for sharing after a big meal bread service is lovely with a nice variety to choose from and we also enjoyed the salad to start not unique but a nice starter if you need vegetables the mac and cheese side is totally the way to go with your steak rich and creamy with a good firmness to the pasta solid 4 stars and worth a stop if you re in vegas dinner runs about 100 pp without alcohol
  wanted mexican food that wouldn t take a long time we had a show to get to to be truthful i thought it was on the border it was not we were seated quickly and the waitress was super nice and very helpful the layout was nice but from my seat i was staring out the door to what i think was a patio lots of sun to blind me and i didn t see any sun shades we got the guacome to start it was very authentic and tasted fresh and delicious the chips were fresh and had a great flavor my wife had a sangria she thought it was a little watery but not being a drinker the alcohol snuck up a little i had a chelada the lime was a little overwhelming but good i ordered the skirt steak it was seasoned perfect and cooked awesome i loved it the mole sauce on side was great it came with one giant handmade tortilla so wonderful it rocked my wife had the short rib enchiladas she said they were good but did not rave about them for dessert we got the banana cream pie get it that s all i am saying it was a little pricey but really good
  their pho has too much spices for my taste preference their lotus root salad is light freshing healthy and good the prices for their items are a little bit high
  i have tried everything from the their bowls burritos taco and quesadillas never have i been disappointed great food and consistent service keeps me coming back love us some zabas
  pho get about it your other asian spot do not be fooled by the outside landlord needs to update as for simis does a fine job inside from decor to taste great service and very helpful clean family owned and operated of course so good
  there s a rumor that you can only get legit mexican food closer to san diego or only in mexico tacos el gordo puts this rumor six feet under with it s authentic mexican flavor and great customer appreciation advertised as coming straight from tijuana it s no wonder that tacos el gordo or the fat taco in english is a taco above the rest upon walking in the amorous fragrance of the spices grab your nose and the various meats cooking make your mouth water like an infant drooling yes it s just like that my favorite spectacle of the restaurant is the bbq spit that holds the fresh al pastor meat marinated spicy pork i suggest the al pastor mula with everything cilantro onions salsa and avocado salsa and suadero marinated beef tacos with everything make sure you don t forget the free grilled peppers and green onions at the end of the ordering line grab your limes pay and ask the cashier if you d like some salsa if you choose to get a fountain drink i suggest getting a cup full of some refreshing orange bang whipped orange drink that tastes like an orange creamsicle and brace yourself for some filling satisfying flavor packed and the most authentic mexican grub this side of the border writing this review triggered my craving so i m actually on my way to fulfill myself warning this reviewer and his reviews are not responsible for addictions to great food you ve been warned you re welcome
  amazing from the appetizers to the dessert the food is terrific for appetizers we had the mac and cheese wontons the disco poutin and the calamari for our main course wehad the bad girl pasta which was succulent largest shrimps and scallops i ve ever had others in our party had the adam s ribs and the spaghetti and meatballs all amazing they saved the best for last dessert was unbelievable the beignet were second only to cafe du monde and the french toast with ice cream was the best dessert ever the service was great and the price was very reasonable
  freshly made pita and fantastic lamb kabobs will bring me back also loved the greek salad the babaganoush was pretty good the gyro while decent i ll probably skip in the future because those kabobs were so damn tasty quick fresh and fairly priced yep i am a fan
  the food was good had a great hamburger and a pretzel our waitress was hot and provided great service good place to catch the game
  truly wasn t too happy about this buffet especially since were at the wynn the buffet should be as great as the restaurant the food wasn t kept hot and was pretty bland i wouldn t recommend coming to this buffet however if you re looking for the best buffet in vegas go to wicked spoon in the cosmo you ll never go to any other buffet after that
  hey im writing about my expierience at hml on saturday night we got there at about 12 and my husband is 30 and was asked for his id and wouldnt let us in we went back home and got it then you only server girl was pretty rude we requested music and she said no she told us not to keep moving the coal but she would take for ever to come and ask if everything was ok or offer drinks or recommendations lastly when it was time to pay because we did not feel welcomed at all she took like 20 mins to come and ring us up she came out put new coal on everyone and then rung us up i have never been to hml but kept hearing it was a nice place to hang out and chill i am disappointed that your server did not suffice the customer
  i ve been here a few times over the year each visit has been great no issues with the orders and the staff was great the facility may be small but it has been clean each visit there are also concrete tables outside that anyone can use to eat outside
  long wait and very busy i had a bacon cheeseburger fries an a ice tea for under 10 00 and was not bad at all i though the place had a ton of choices and a decent burger the meat is a little thin but good enough especially for the price much better choice than white castle or other places out here plus they have a million shakes which i was too full to have so i will definitely be coming back for seconds and try one of the shakes
  what a great place food is delicious and the place is beautiful i plan on coming back often
  not a summer restaurant for phoenix we went for happy hour on a day when it was still over 100 degrees the open air kitchen means the chef is probably more comfortable but the diners get to experience the heat from the ovens the front of the restaurant faces west so we had the glaring sun shining into eyes until sundown and we could feel the heat radiating through the windows we asked the waiter to draw the curtains and he told us they keep them up to maintain an open feel to help cool the place down and get a cross breeze someone had propped open the doors so we were swarmed with flies one person in our group of four actually got up and left and said she d rather stop at burger king on the way home and eat in the park if she was going to have sweat through her dinner have the sun in her eyes and swat flies while she ate i should have left with her i went back at night on a cooler evening and the inside environment was much more pleasant both times the food was good and the portions are generous nothing worse than leaving a restaurant and having to resist the temptation to hit a drive through on the way home because your fancy meal with trendy sized portions left you hungry the place is trendy and the wait staff is friendly the outdoor bar is wonderful for the few times a year you d want to sit outside in the long az summer for a drink i expect it will be great in the spring and fall weather i enjoyed the lettuce wraps swiss chard i learned is not a cheese but rather a type of lettuce leaf and the coconut chicken and the ginger sauce it comes with are great good pours on the drinks
  happened to be in the area for a swim class and thought we would give pio pio a try best chicken in charlotte i dare say pretty good the sides sauces and service were all great as well they serve lavazza coffee as well good all around
  my brother in law is a beer afficionado which prompted our visit to yard house at red rock he likes bjs and big dogs but we wanted to step it up during his recent visit to las vegas first the selection of beer impressed mbil he had three different selections during the meal and was pleased all around my partner had a double chocolate stout which has become his favorite and i opted for the french gimlet a variation on the classic which did no disappoint the slider appetizers were good the street tacos very good the rack of ribs very good and the bbq bacon burger was not disappointing all in all it was a good experience except on a saturday night at 9pm the place was crawling with children children everrywhere we had expected a beer joint in the middle of a casino would be an adult destination but not screaming children running the isles abounded station s casinos need to rethink the policy of kids in this restaurant maybe a curfew
  i was terribly dissatisfied by the pitcher of margarita that we ordered it was myself my sister and my husband and we got a pitcher to share basically we got margarita mix and a lime wedge they were too sour to enjoy i would not come here for margarita unless it s happy hour the food was like warm even though we waited almost 20 mins i d look elsewhere for mexican in vegas the stars are for the chips and guacamole and salsa
  so i went to this place with some friends as we live really close by when we arrived we were seated right away and presented with menus as i tend to be a little sensitive with spicy food i asked the waitress about various dishes and their spiciness level and ended up ordering the pad thai with shrimp which was quite tasty and had plenty of shrimp although it still had the tails my husband being the spice lover got the pumpkin curry with chicken which came with some brown rice and per reports was really good we also ordered the spring rolls for the table and those were nice a crispy and were served with a tasty sweet sauce as we were finishing our dishes the owner came to our table to ensure that every one in our party was pleased which was pretty nice the wait staff was also very helpful in order to help me find a dish that i would like due to my lack of spice tolerance overall i enjoyed the experience and would return oh and btw this place is byob so bonus for that
  i am a huge fan of their wings they are the full wing our waiter described it as double jointed which comprises of the 2 pieces of hot wings that we are used to which isn t something you normally see happy hour makes the prices even more worthwhile as the bill can rack up fairly quick a few months ago i came here with a few friends and played beer pong it s not as convenient here as it may seem as the ping pong balls will be disruptive to the other diners can t wait to come back next time
  i ordered online i can t handle anything spicy at all online they even have a spice level from 0 10 to choose from i chose the 0 obviously the food took over an hour to arrive i ordered yellow curry and extra rice i got the curry and a small side of rice the side of rice is a joke i received a huge curry and tiny thing of rice why i didn t get my normal size rice as well is strange anyways i went up the street to chopsticks and got a large side of rice came home and started to eat my food two bites into it my whole mouth was on fire i am so pissed i paid 30 for food that made my throat hurt and made me sick so i basically threw away 30 and had to drive to get rice for food i didn t even eat i will never go back to this horrible place
  heard great things about this place what a let down it was made reservations for our anniversary and showed up on time early evening on a friday night we ordered the ravioli and a personal pizza it took 47 minutes for our food to come out i was counting because it was rediculous the restaraunt was half empty and we sat there for 47 minutes with a little bread and oil wich they refilled twice because the food was taking so long and never refilled our empty water glasses i decided at 50 minutes we were leaving lo and behold at 47 minutes it comes out bland and soggy as we ve ever tasted opposite of what we expected from such an upscale italian dining experience they never apologized for the long wait for our food and pretended everything was normal and fine we scarfed it down in a hurry to leave and asked for the bill the waitress put it on the table and then took almost 10 minutes more to return to charge it when we were obviously packed up and ready to go we just walked up to the register and had someone else nearby handle it for us my husband went to pull the car around while i finished up with the bill look i know these are first world problems and truthfully my husband and i always enjoy each others company so much that we hardly notice a long wait for our food plus we were there on a gift card but we were trying to make it to a show that night and ended up arriving late and all for a meal that kinda sucked even worse when my husband and i got up to leave a table of 2 next to us received their food they had only been seated 15 minutes earlier i never complain about waitstaff mostly because i used to be a waitress but what pushed me so far as to get on yelp about it is what i witnessed on the way out the door while i was standing by the door waiting for them to charge our card a very elderly woman whom i had noticed was standing there a long time asked the hostess how much longer for a table and the hostess said about 20 more minutes the elderly woman replied thats what you said 20 minutes ago and i see 5 empty tables the hostess got very rude with her and retorted ma am some people plan ahead and make reservations and its impossible to tell you the exact amount of time you will need to wait because we dont know how much longer people will be staying they might order dessert or more drinks you can go to another establishment seeing this old woman as i would my own grandmother i stuck my neck out and spoke up to the hostess i said listen i ve noticed this woman standing here a very long time you don t have any chairs for people up here to sit in and wait so shes just been standing here if you told her the wait was going to be 20 minutes you need to seat her after 20 minutes if you were nt sure exactly how long the wait would be you should have told her that in the first place instead of getting angry at her for going by what you said also it would nt hurt to show a little more respect to your elders the hostess looked at her friend and rolled her eyes sarcasticly as to say who is this bi hahahaha very rude very worst service in years sorry dishonorable staff unimpressive food
  i was just expecting a filipino food fix but this place really brought me home authentic tastes and its not your usual cafeteria tasting dish it is really tasty despite the grounded ambience of plastic spoon forks and plates this must be the go to place for every filipino in az thats needing some manila glimpse the moment you enter you ll be treated like any other filipino its awesome for awhile i really felt i was in the philippines
  not too impressed but again i m not used to north carolina bbq service was great best fried pickles i ve ever had
  once i heard the story maybe it isnt true about this place and that they were fans of mission chinese is san fran and nyc i had to give it a try coming from nyc i was craving some great metropolitan asian food the ambiance was nice the building itself looks pretty cool service was good the bartender and cocktails were awesome id say some of the best cocktails ive ever had food also good solid i had the pork ramen something ive been craving and it didnt disappoint only thing i think could have bee better was the meat cut to be a little less tough i guess also had the pork face dumplinga excellent and the grilled octopus also tasty overall id definitely recommend to others and go back
  i love chipotle but this location blows one of the girls was flirting with some guy in line and ignoring my order he handed he chocolate milk over the counter and all three of the employees had a drink while preparing food it was disgusting i also had to ask an employee 4 times to change the diet coke because it was out but he was to busy standing around to get it done
  located in a shopping centre cosmos has a lively interior and loud music thumping after 9 30 pm presumably to attract the older meet market that flocks here the food was average to moderately good we ordered the california dip a spinach avocado dip with parmesan on top and pita served on the side the spinach tasted like it was straight out of a can but otherwise the dip was serviceable and we gobbled it up due to sheer hunger i had the fried goat cheese salad delicious croquette of fried cheese how can you go wrong sitting atop a well dressed salad with pistachios sprinkled on it as well fellow guest had the lamb burgers spiced well but overcooked with dry ish buns accompanying fries tasted again like they were straight out of the freezer big stumble of the night we ordered molten lava cake which somehow did not get made in the kitchen the waiter disappeared for 25 mins while we waited and we ended up having to hunt him down he was apologetic but nonetheless the experience was mostly ruined he disappeared once again while we waited for the check final recommendation come here just for drinks and dancing and perhaps some tapas at the bar where the bartenders are attentively serving the patrons
  extremely good restaurant classic fish fry country fried steak rib eye were perfect wait staff was friendly fast enjoyed the food they have bike night on thursdays reasonably priced good quality nice ambiance
  this place was great the server recommended something s that i found very tasty the lobster ceviche was amazing soooo good i asked about the duck breast and he recommended the mushroom and sauce which was so rich and flavorful i loved it this place is tits i kid you not a at the very least
  i was craving italian and thought i d try out some italian food in litchfield park this place is tucked away in the back corner of a shopping center there was about 20 tables total for indoor seating and maybe 5 table outside the kitchen was basically the center piece of the restaurant on a friday night i assumed it would be super slammed so i made a reservation just in case we got there and there were maybe 4 tables filled it was very quiet which was nice the service was slow but we honestly didn t mind at all we took our time and enjoyed ourselves we started with their complimentary bread basket that was very fresh and delicious then we ordered baked brie for our starter which how can you go wrong with that the we ordered two entrees which included either soup or salad the salad was average and the clam chowder was overly salty the shrimp scampi with mushrooms a side of veggies and pasta was great also we tried the seafood napoli which was also very good both entrees were very large and could easily be split between two people if you wanna try this place out take your time and enjoy it
  went here for lunch this weekend and had the mix it thing with 1 2 salad and 1 2 panini i had the house salad with the gorgonzola vinaigrette and the roast beef panini the panini was excellent but the salad was not the dressing lacked flavor i m going to stick to the caesar
  the food was horrible calamari was chewy spaghetti with bolognese was worse than prego would not recommend to anyone
  if i m paying 40 00 for a buffet meal then it better be the best damn buffet meal that i will ever have on the face of this terrestrial planet that we call earth sadly it fell a little short of my expectations me and my cohorts decided to come here at the rio for their dinner buffet i didn t want to eat here due to the very hefty price tag but i didn t want to be a party pooper of sorts so i gave in call me a cheapskate but for 40 00 that is easily a week s worth of groceries that i could buy for my apartment the dinner was 30 my company did not want to wait over an hour in the regular line so we bypassed it and went to the express line for an additional 10 fee there is a lot of variety here too many dishes to name all of the food that i had was good except for the alfredo i didn t eat any of the desserts so i can comment on that i made an attempt to get as full as possible so i went back to the buffet an additional three times good food and possibly one of the best buffets that i have been to in recent memory just expensive as hell though
  just having come from a trip at the hotel across the street from this little wonder i got to speak night one about midnight i go in there are about 5 people waiting in line fewer are behind the counter the lights are on mister manager announces we close for 30 minutes order later curious rude dismissive night two the layout of the place makes for poor line control from s las vegas blvd won walks into a box type eating area then for no good reason the ordering counters swing to an angle one is challenged as to were the line is and which line they are in the management staff was rough with staff and the staff seemingly part of the clinton welfare reform failure people working in a mcdy s on the strip need a certain group of skills the one s at this mcdy s lacked skills
  i have been to the hash house before and loved it the food is soooo good but sadly this time i am only giving it 2 stars and they are lucky to get those we came in on sunday 8 17 around 11 30am it was past the breakfast rush and before the lunch rush i don t know if it was just our server but my goodness the service was terrible we seated ourselves as the sign requests there were many empty tables yet the first thing our server told us was how busy it was we looked around very confused but whatever maybe they were short staffed nope i counted three servers in a very small restaurant should be plenty it took us about 10 mins just to get coffee which we desperately needed once we got the coffee i had to wait another 5 mins for the milk for the coffee i finally gave up and went to the counter to get the milk my server appeared to have forgotten since we knew this was already off to a bad start we all figured out what we wanted quickly and ordered as soon as we could get our servers attention getting a refill on coffee was literally like pulling teeth we noticed the two yes only two other tables that were occupied commenting on how long it was taking that they were just going to leave and so on we were hungry so we stayed after waiting a significant time one of my friends asked our server if our food would be out soon honest to goodness she looked like she either didn t know what we were talking about or was put off by us asking she replied oh i don t know i will go see i am sorry what after she went to go see our food was brought out not 5 mins later it wasn t super hot so maybe it had been sitting there i don t know anyways the food was just as good as i remembered the jams are sooo good the apple and raspberry jams are amazing i am super bummed to give the hash house a bad review but dang that service was no good get it together guys great food is well great but terrible service can kill a restaurant
  surprisingly good restaurant they had really good breakfast burritos and breakfast sandwiches don t let the out ward appearance fool you its a wonderful little restaurant
  i ve said it before i hate breakfast there s something about hash house a go go that changes my mind though maybe it s the delicious bloody marys that can be had at 8 in the morning yes i did get talked into buying the souvenir glass what it s all tilty and cute maybe it s the fact that this place is a stellar restaurant in an otherwise shitty hotel casino makes you feel like you ve actually won in vegas when you stumble upon it it might also be the fact that the food is inventive sustainable and delicious as well as huge and there is good music pumping too thankyoufornotplayingtechnoorpophere whatever it is it comes down to this the food and drinks were great the service was amazing and i was thrilled to actually be enjoying breakfast something i rarely make it to in vegas the only thing i can complain about is the bench seats along the edge of the restaurant i was forced to sit next to my husband instead of across from him the horror
  the first visit shows some promise the cheese curds are great but best with regular ranch
  imbeciles work here i ordered a shrimp burrito and they gave me uncooked chicken will not come back
  among the hidden gems of sushi fresh thai food narai is ranked top on my list from the friendly courteous servers katelyn to the delicious food that never let s me down if you re in the market for something new then id point to narai
  it s been years since i ve tried this place only been a couple of times but what i have tasted in the past has been great their refried beans are pretty good they taste homemade and the flavor is pretty good salsa is great chips seem light and fluffy and they used to have a 99 cent taco day for a few hours on a monday or tuesday that was an amazing deal don t know if they still have that but their taco s are pretty good in taste only downfall i find is that they are pretty skimpy in filling them with ingredients and low on the meat would like to try their chile relleno don t know if it s good or not
  dinner here was amazing we made sure to get an earlier reservation 6 30 on a friday evening so we didn t have to worry about the night club crowd coming or having our reservation be bumped i had originally asked for a private table after reading reviews on here about some tables being too close to one another we were seated on the third level over looking the main floor and the table couldn t have been more perfect there were two of us having dinner this evening and tao didn t disappoint at this time slot for a romantic evening the lighting decor and music were all absolutely perfect we started out with the lobster wontons and veggie dumplings he had a gin and tonic i ordered a shirley temple unfortunately he brought me a roy rogers but i wasn t going to whine about it and have him run down three flights of stairs for another soda for this pregnant chick entrees were wasabi crusted filet mignon and orange chicken with pork fried rice phen o menal i have never had such good food enter my mouth i hate steak and my husbands cut of meat almost turned me into a convert dessert was fruit and sorbet making for a perfect food ending to the experience our server was just ok but the young man doing the clean up work was the one who deserved the kudos just an over all pleasant guy i suggest this restaurant to anyone just make sure you go earlier in the evening and i think you ll be hard pressed to bitch about anything
  i m wavering between 2 and 3 stars good thing i had a dang good sandwich so this place is kind of funny i live right down the street and had no idea it existed it s kind of tucked back in a parking lot the gigantic fake waterfall outside the front entrance makes you feel like you re about to stand in line for one of those water rides where you re thrown around in a log boat at an amusement park there are bats decorating the whole place it s just funky we were greeted by the bartender who sat the 5 of us me parents grandparents and promptly walked away it became very clear to me that the one lone server was in over his head although i only saw 2 tables outside by the waterfall and one other table besides us while we waited and waited to be greeted bartender had no one to tend bar for she couldn t have at least helped the dude out and taken our drink orders server was slightly spastic but nice enough it took a while to get our drinks and then even more of a while to place our order he was running in and outside like a crazy person to his credit our order came out correctly the menu is semi hilarious it s inside a fake newspaper and boasts all kinds of tex mex grill general meat loving delicacies being a vegetarian i was all buh but thought the portales portabella sounded delicious and it was at huge sandwich of a basamic marinated portabella on fresh focaccia with different roasted peppers red onion pepperjack and avocado hot diggity what it was good i could barely eat half and savored the leftovers for the next meal it was served with a huge portion of seasoned fries my grandma tried the green chili mac and a side order portion was pretty huge it was tasty pepperjack and cheddar cheese corn chiles all served in a tortilla covered bowl have you heard my new rap song carbsoncarbsoncarbs in all it was an ok lunch again i was pretty appalled by the lack of help the one server got from the bartender and manager who seemingly had not much to do maybe i m just sensitive to my fellow service industry family
  i was craving cupcakes and did a search here on yelp sassy s seemed close and per their menu advertisement cupcakes were 1 50 or 2 00 i called got the assortment of flavors for the day and thought i d give them a try the staff was very polite but immediately when a regular came in i was rushed to get out so they could help him i realize small businesses thrive on their regulars but if you don t make new ones feel welcomed dot expect your business to grow then when i asked for price clarification i was told that all the cupcakes were 2 50 because they were filled and how much work went into them really i looked at their menu and supposedly they were to have different price points due to my cravings i did buy some since i had driven all the way there they also have frosted sugar cookies that were very good i highly recommend those i ve tried two of the cupcakes so far and the lemon drop far outweighs the vanilla cream i wouldn t say don t go to this place but be prepared to pay small business prices and if your not a regular you may not be a priority lastly the decor was pink reminded me of candy land but service is far more important to me than decor anyways they do serve breakfast and lunch and from what i saw going out it looked decent but if have to eat it to review
  first things first very clean maybe not important to everyone but for me it is i went for the first time and had two tacos and a nachos all were affordable and tasty and made fresh yes the steak for my asada tacos and nachos was grilled right in front of me not scooped from a pile of previously cooked meat now that fresh cooking means that you will have to wait a little while so if you are in a rush you might want to go somewhere else but definately come back whern you have more time i also enjoyed the free chips from the self serve salsa bar in the dining area they were heavily salted which i like but if you are not doing salt then i guess you will have to skip these the dining room has adequate seating and a big screen tv usually showing sports there is a cantina pub connected to the dining room but i didnt go in there the friendly service topped off the whole experience to make my visit a five star visit
  excellent service and food very clean friendly folks beautiful patio
  worst food i ve eaten california chicken tasted like it came straight from a microwave and the 10 oz steak was over cooked and did not have any taste the baked potato was just as bad will not eat here again
  place is awesome chicken andouille po boy is off the hook
  as an irish lass how can i not like this bar this is the type of place where everyone can feel welcome in the same night i saw the young not so young singles couples and even two adorable grandmas who came in for drinks after evening mass these feisty ladies proudly told me they show up there on st patrick s day at 6am that is dedication erin go bragh warning 2 blue moon on tap in the hands of the unsupervised can cause you to become bffs with everyone around you offer dating advice to strangers and completely lose track of time just so you know time flies when you are having fun
  some amazing friends of mine surprised me and set up a whole birthday dinner at jug n barrel this was my first time here and was shocked at how cute the place was even in a strip mall it actually had a fireplace which gave it a very cozy feel the wine list is great and not too intimidating we had a great server who even put together a wine flight to match my sweet tooth the only thing that knocks a star more like 1 5 stars off the rating is the completely average food we had a group of about 12 and ordered several appetizers and all of us ordered entrees i don t think any of us were blown away by our meals although i will not return for a meal i would return for wine with friends
  my husband says that it was the best steak that he has ever eaten and he eats a lot of steak mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were good and large enough to share loved the ambiance very dark cigar room like great wine list and great service
  i wasn t expecting much but i was pleasantly surprised we went on taco tuesday where they serve 1 chicken or beef tacos my husband got several of both and was happy with the tenderness of the pulled chicken as well as the attention to detail light grilling the outside of the soft taco shells i was completely wowed by the black bean queso burger the bun was amazing and the queso spicy i did ask for southwest ranch which made it even better i ll definitely be back
  great service cheerful atmosphere food was served very quickly and tasted great g
  first impressions are lasting impressions right some might say it s ludicrous to grant 5 stars to a restaurant that you ve only eaten at once but these guys are on point not just with the service but also the fantastic food i have never been giddy for a restaurant before this ironically the couple that came in after us was just as giddy the kept talking about how their friend raved about the place and i can assure it s not all hype everything is made to order so expect a wait for crabs and chat it up with the owners live crabs are delivered on wednesdays and boy oh boy are they good i can honestly say that the garlic crabs were some of the best crabs i ve ever had they were seriously orgasmic with a capital o what s kfc s slogan again finger licking good heeeeeck na this place is so much more deserving i seriously sucked every single one of my fingers crab cake kinda guy the crab cakes were made just how i like them little filling lots of crab lumps cooked to a golden brown on both sides and amazingly tasty lemonade kinda person they have some good homemade lemonade don t do crab okay how bout shrimp the fried shrimp omg seriously my new absolute favorite shrimp and they tell me the steamed shrimp is even better if you re worried about looking cute while you gnaw on a claw don t stress too much it s to go only atm they do plan to expand next door and add seating though the crab shack is just that a hole in the wall there s a counter a kitchen some benches and two awesome owners manning the register and kitchen upon entering you ll be happily greeted and they might ask how you heard about them it seems most of their customer base is due to referrals and word of mouth so if you still haven t heard let my big mouth be the first to tell you if you like crab fish or shrimp you must check out the crab shack
  been here a few times wife loves it because of their hot dogs burgers or steakburgers as they call it is pretty good this location always have a great environment and is always clean seems like they are always busy and always have a lot of high school kids working there so patients is needed at times now for their hot dogs wife likes them buns are buttered toasted dogs are a all vienna beef hot dog and they are pretty good steakburgers are actually very good they look very thin and smashed but the flavor are very good should at least try them our experience has always been positive and enjoyable
  very nice atmosphere especially the chandelier decoration over the bar haven t seen something like it the service was very good i came with a few friends to try out this place i ordered the fez kisra which was very good never had something like it before a very good experience for me
  late lunch large variety on the menu i had the filling station special grilled ham and cheese plenty of thin sliced ham with a very good dijon mustard sauce my friend had the fountain hill club wrap which was enough for two people very good service was prompt and courteous
  what a great addition to gilbert the nachos were delicious so unique and flavorful great bartender friendly staff definitely going back
  my goto spot in champaign great gyros awesome jerusalem salad i m so happy they re opened after the fire i ve been a customer for 30 years
  this place is awful now i know why every time we go by on the boat no one is out there stay away horrible food horrible service ordered a drink and the waitress forgot to bring it out until halfway through or meal my cajun chicken panini had no cheese on it was over cooked and overkilled with cajun seasoning disgusting my husbands pork was overcooked not to mention we waited 30 minutes for our food to come out and there were only 6 tables filled in the whole place never ever ever going back
  damn good the guac is a bit on the expensive side but very tasty all of the tacos and breakfast burritos that i have had there are very tasty this place is legit
  enjoyed the food this used to be a johnny rockets restaurant so it has that retro look price is reasonable will go again for vietnamese food when the craving comes
  the food was horrible i ordered the red white and blue slam with a side of bacon the blueberry pancakes tasted like they were reheated in the microwave and dry the bacon was burnt refried and full of grease and my plastic cup of water had brown stuff stuck at the bottom this is my first and last time here
  pleasantly surprised by this out of the way stand food prices were pretty good we got a burger and chicken fingers and found the portion sizes to be generous the fries were good as many other reviewers have mentioned since it s in the sports book nobody under 21 can eat here they do offer takeout though their menu is probably among the more kid friendly of the restaurants we had a food beverage credit with the room and this was also one of the only places open later at night service is somewhat slow so they lose a star beverage dessert prices seem out of proportion compared to the reasonable food prices
  chef s table was a stitch i sound like an old lady using that descriptor and i suppose to many i am but what modern word best includes captivating and amusing anyway thanks to samantha o s advice i made a reservation for the chef s table which basically means you sit at a bar top that faces the kitchen area where you are greeted by the chef who is swirling his frothy glenlivet personable and cheerful and cranking out items to dazzle palates he ll ask if you have any foods you can t eat and then he ll just start plopping plates in front of you one course at a time mostly small plates 10 per course cry uncle when you want him to stop you can also take a break don t miss the impressive dessert sampler be sure to save room house wines are fantastic totally worthwhile experience p s thanks for the pointer samantha o you re my hero
  i organized a big corporate dinner and for the most part it went well but for the main event i would have to say the steaks were not very good my table of 8 split between the ribeye and the filet 6 out of 8 sent our steaks sent back due to it was rare when it was requested medium it was served cold or simply too fatty and not very pleasant to eat look at good service but poor food execution you ve been chopped
  nice decor and light well stocked bar food is mostly organic as well as a lot of local providers
  our favorite place to eat excellent service very good food what ever you eat is delicious soups are really good
  best breakfast in phoenix
  i would not bother out of hot sauce soda was flat the nachos came out cold the manager could have cared less and the wait staff id horrible the food was made wrong and itr only took over two hours get out of there menu could be promising this is our second horrendous experience thought we would give it another try
  my inclination is to recommend avoiding at all costs draft beers including swills such as bud light and what i not so affectionately refer to as that headache in a can tecate are 8 so unless you actually take advantage of the happy hour wheel offering drink specials or those 3 draft free margarita with an entree cards not to be confused with the hooker trading cards handed out on the sidewalks along the strip don t expect to drink here on the cheap i can t however speak for the food which i took a pass on for no other reason that i don t think tacos should cost 12 but maybe that s just me
  i ate here with my mother husband and 2 year old it was ok service was not good took longer than most places to place order no one came to check on us provided only partial components of the kid s meal and shame on gray s for offering only fountain drinks on the kids menu also fries come with some kids meals but applesauce only with others and slow appearance to clear and give check also did not offer a box for more than half the food on the plate which wasn t really a loss since the mac and cheese was a glob of box looking m c i had the chicken pesto sandwich which was fine but nothing unique what i really liked was the selection of their sodas and surprised that they had diet root beer and diet cream soda i wish they would serve with a glass though i would go back since it s probably the best thing going in verona
  honestly coming from los angeles i was disappointed by the lack chinese food options in the area but baoding is a good consistent lunch stop they have a very easy menu with your standard fare they are quick and the staff is nice enough i wouldn t recommend it for dinner but it is a great lunch standard the place is a bit small for big groups though
  every good story has a good ending dessert first homemade on site so when its gone its gone lucky for us the rhubarb tart thing was not gone and it was delicious and fresh and had a crumbly top that totally worked schnitzel for the spouse devoured pork belly for me and it was so flavorful and tender like a little hug from back home side dish concept is interesting read the choices and pair with your food for best result beets with horseradish was great to offset the rich meats full service bar was a plus the menu is extensive and fun something for everyone family owned
  when it was announced that my annual uni chemistry ball was to be held in the national galleries i had visions of us wining and dining along aside the artworks a risky premise i thought of course what i had forgotten was that there is a great wee cafe and restaurant underneath the galleries which was where our ball was held previous venues included the george hotel and ghillie dhu so expectations were high upon arrival in quite a surreptitious manner we had to be let in the side entrance by a member of council staff as the only entry via princes st gardens is otherwise locked up after 6pm we were warmly greeted with glasses of prosecco so far so good after a half hour cocktail reception we were allowed into the main restaurant area for our meal with regards to decor this place is classy and cosy there are clear scottish influences without being overwhelmed with tartan i particularly liked the wee beakers that doubled up as candle holders it s always the small details that impress me what i was most excited about though was the food as per the norm it was clear that this restaurant was all about promoting local produce as there was a big board at the front explaining where all the key ingredients from the meal had come from by half 7 my tummy was rumbling so i was delighted at the plentiful bread supply at the table with some oil dip maybe could have done with some butter or balsamic vinegar as well if i was being picky the bread was fresh and tasty and kept me going until the starter of fishcakes were served i m not usually a fishcake y person but these were little round servings of haddock heaven complimented well with a lemon mayonnaise light and tasty the perfect way to start a meal the beef that followed was also a winning choice only recently have i discovered how much more flavoursome red meat is when it s not cooked thoroughly this cut accompanied with a rich herby butter and tenderstem broccoli was beautiful and all this was atop of a lovely rosti simple fresh well cooked by the time dessert came i was a bit full still i was excited for the chocolate and orange pudding and it looked lovely a wine glass full of chocolateness topped with some pretty little flowery things red cress is that a thing i m not quite sure what it was and crunched honeycomb but i really struggled to get through it and this is someone who has a mouthful of sweet teeth it tasted delicious don t get me wrong it was however very rich almost like eating a slightly melted cup of terry s chocolate orange maybe if it had been in the form of a torte with a bit of biscuit base action it would have been a bit more stomachable overall though a gorgeous meal in a sophisticated setting and i take my hat off the the staff who were discreet and efficient set us up for a night of ceilidh ing and latterly boogie ing and was a lovely location for what was my final chemistry ball
  the sign screams mod super fast which is a bummer and false advertising because it s anything but fast in fact it s very slow and then our breadsticks pizza came out thin cold i d be more forgiving but the expectation was an in out and then we sat around forever in line and then waiting for our pizza and it wasn t worth the wait the create your own pile on concept is great for different tastes in the family but that s about it
  one of the best breakfast places on the strip always open and always tasty
  the pasta dishes show some imagination and used tasty ingredients the fried calamari was excellent the wait staff was very friendly and efficient the price for each dish was very reasonable servings were ample
  awesome food friendly staff and really good beer what else could you want from a restaurant
  a bit upset super dragon ruined it for me about a year ago after my bf introduced me to this place i can no longer eat shrimp fried rice anywhere else in the valley compared to sd everything else is simply gross love super dragon and the workers
  i m very picky when it comes to food from my culture especially in vegas because there are so few options for good indian food my first time here and in between my 2nd and 3rd plate i have to say it has hit the spot all the food is extremely flavorful and hits every part of palette the curry chicken tandoori chicken and butter chicken with the butter naan are delicious squeeze a little lemon and your good to go the service is good and everyone is very friendly i will be coming back here for the lunch buffet and this place has instantly become my favorite indian restaurant in town
  awesome dinner as usual tonight beet watermelon salad is amazing and a new fav swordfish milanese to all you foodies visit rm seafood on your next visit to las vegas more than just seafood added treat chef rick moonen is always there
  very pleased to have this new spot in the neighborhood the menu is full of delicious looking options to both eat and drink i have done takeout twice and was very pleased on both occasions with both the service and the food the base what i know to be a margarita pizza has been my favorite thus far the owners are super attentive and friendly and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting thanks for coming to the area
  i highly recommend this wonderful mexican restaurant the only one i go to when i have the cravings for mexican food and i sure would invite my friends to come with me as i know they won t be disappointed this is a great place i highly recommend
  they ve got it figured out
  if your looking for something different to eat this is the place i had a chicken greek pasty it was excellent we stopped for lunch and as we were driving by we saw a decent crowd so we stopped to see what they were giving away lol we enjoyed our choices it is a laid back place to enjoy the day so everything was good and the experience was most enjoyable
  i give this place 3 stars because the food is good not awesome but the price is defintely meant for killer food i only paid for the food to avoid the club cover charge if you re only looking for a nice dinner i suggest going to another restaurant in the venetian wolf gang has a few good ones around the area
  as a huge sonic fan this is by far the worst sonic i have ever been to the service seeing as how there wasn t many people there wonder why was slow the credit card machine in my parking spot was broken when i told the car hop she did not really seem to care once i got back home which was across the street my food was cold and very sloppily put together i had a chili dog nothing crazy the staple of sonic drive ins by reading the other reviews poor decision hindsight this place is in desperate need of some new management
  the food is delicious and priced well staff are very well informed and friendly the mixed drinks are great too try the bourbonnade restaurant is kid friendly
  upscale ambiance excellent service correct size portions all natural fresh ingredients you can t go wrong with anything you order at this restaurant good setting for a romantic date
  completely running into this place by accident without the aid of friends or yelp reviews i am overwhelmingly pleased that i not only found a place i enjoyed that night but for many occasions to come i wasn t really sure what to expect when i walked in and at first i was overwhelmed it seemed like a neverending lot of treasures to discover there were old signs all over the walls stop lights the ads in the glass on the tables a wagon full of fixins for everyone to add to their meal as i eyed the menu and gazed upon the rest of the establishment there were a few tables occupied with an older group of friends and a young boy with his dad there were also a few people at the bar which i spotted in the other room as i finalized my decision while i waited i ordered a coke and loved that they had the digital you can do anything you want with your soda machine total win i think i sat and played with it for minutes luckily there wasn t a line overall the place has a nice relaxing feel in my opinion it may look like it should be dirty but i assure you its not there s a huge part of the restaurant that is not near the bar for the family folk outside the bar is a patio that apparently has horseshoes oh yes you heard me right who s coming with me to play horseshoes i ordered the green chili burger and it was amazing lids are offered for the plastic condiment cups at the fixins bar for those who are ordering to go like i was looks like a potential nice place to sit back and watch a game or play horseshoes
  this is my favorite place to grab a bite to eat or catch up with friends the food is moderately priced and the service is great i highly recommend the house margaritas and the pollo con queso there s never a wait here which is great
  probably the best bar in casa grande they have good bar food it s spacious has a few pool tables you can watch games if there happens to be a ufc fight on you will have to pay a cover charge if you want to stay so pay up or get asked to leave by the large man you confused for a brick divider wall in the evening it turns into a club i m going to say this place provides hands down the best people watching in the area you get a little bit of everything good times lol
  our dinner last night at the chandler flemings was excellent the bacon wrapped filets w tempura shrimp were cooked to perfection and may become a favorite for us whether it s a full dinner or the fabulous bar menu this place never disappoints
  i remember seeing serendipity 3 the last time i was in vegas and thinking how cute the place was i remember being curious but we never went fast forward 2 weeks later i m back in vegas and my friends choose this spot for lunch the restaurant is cute no doubt fun decor i m giving this place 3 stars because we had an okay experience the restaurant wasn t that packed while we were having lunch but everything took forever it took forever to order to get our drinks to get our food and to pay also our server never brought us silverware so it wasn t until we all had our food sitting in front of us for a couple of minutes that we finally got some forks and what not i ordered the oriental chicken salad not a bad salad but not great for 15 it definitely wasn t the best salad i ve had i also ordered a mimosa during lunch which i liked i liked that they not only brought the champagne glass but also brought the remaining amount of champagne in the champagne bottle fancy cute overall the experience here was okay slow service pricey food it looks like from other reviews that the desserts are good maybe ill come back to try it or maybe ill come back if friends want to other than that it wasn t anything too crazy memorable
  this was the first korean spot that i actually enjoyed after moving to vegas from california i ordered the soon tofu soup with beef the flavor was spectacular slightly spicy and just the right authentic ingredients to make it a great tofu soup they add seaweed in this one which i have never tried in any of the soups i ve ordered before it adds a great touch to bring the whole soup together the only thing that bothered me was that the beef was very chewy and chunky soyo could benefit from slicing the beef into smaller pieces the tofu was also very broken up like it had gotten a good beating before it was served on the table the restaurant not only serves korean food but also comes equipped with a full bar our party of 5 sat at one of the booths and sipped on yogurt soju which consisted of all soju there was the tiniest bit of alcohol in it if it even had any the korean servers were young and didn t really know how to serve i m a bit picky on the service but considering that it was a bar i didn t put service high up on my priority list as i normally would at any other restaurant unfortunately there was no button attached to the table so we had to flag our server down a couple a times excellent restaurant excellent food excellent spot to hang out with friends definitely coming back here again
  only chinese place we go to have been going here for over 10 years btw the pad thai is awesome
  open 24 hours holla thank you earl of sandwich for providing a drunkie delicious warm sandwiches after a long night in vegas oh nom nom nom my friends and i came here pretty much every night after the club so 3 nights in a row i had earl of sandwich lol the 3 i tried were the earl s club roasted turkey bacon swiss cheese lettuce tomato and sandwich sauce good more of a safe sandwich to go with the full montagu roast beef turkey swiss and cheddar cheese lettuce tomato and earl s mustard pretty damn goood love the mustard gives it that horseradish type of kick hawaiian bbq grilled chicken roasted ham hawaiian bbq sauce aged swiss cheese and pineapple yummm taste just like a hawaiian bbq pizza definitely a great eat in vegas and cheap 5 99 a sandwich yayyur
  flavorful pho with good meat to noodle ratio the sausage spring rolls at the beginning of our meal were so good i wanted to return later in the evening just for the spring rolls the service is good too the only complaint was having to go find the bathroom outside the establishment the bathrooms are outside in a hallway that is dark have to ask the employees for a key to unlock the bathroom door
  great brunch spot i had the reuben omelette and it really tasted like a reuben sandwich in between eggs the portions are huge and the prices are low it s the perfect place to come to with some friends after a big night out only disappointment the chocolate chip pancakes
  although it seems that rubio s in on the cusp of dropping their standards they are still good the fish tacos rock
  decent food but nothing to rave about the worst thing about this place is you can t enjoy the food you eat because its so damn cold i get that it s summertime in vegas but come on it was unbearable the food is not worth the bad experience
  stellar spot for a special dinner no hoodies if you get my drift yet no bowties either casual elegance the staff is friendly attentive keeps the right amount of distance so what did we eat simple spaghetti with tomato basil and fresh ricotta market fish salmon sitting on an orzo like grain with olives and tomato cannoli to finish compliments of the chef he served us two to try one vanilla and one chocolate he wanted our opinion on which was tastier we were more than willing to be the guinea pigs a sweet surprise
  i had this place on my list for quite a while and since i wanted to try something different i decided to finally stop here although i was a little skeptical about their specialty japanese and italian fusion i wasn t sure what to expect but maybe mixing two of my favorite cuisines could actually be good my friend was on the passengers seat so he had no choice but to follow and venture with me the place is nice nothing fancy small but comfortable and practical very japanese service was good the waitress brought us our beer and food in a timely manner as we get ready to eat my friend rubs his chopsticks and tells me to do the same thing that he read somewhere that it is good luck to do so i didn t want to burst his bubble and tell him the real reason that you rub the chopsticks is to warm them up and in turn keep the food you re eating warm so i rubbed the sticks for luck placed them down and started eating with my fork the food was great we had the italian spring roll and the calamari in lemon garlic sauce for appetizers and we shared the manila clams with torako pasta i had to have something for dessert so i went for the tarimisu everything was soo good i think i m a new fan of jaitanese food next time i m debating between eating japanese or italian i ll know where to go el pollo loco just kidding about the chopsticks and as arnold would say i ll be back
  if i could give more stars i would yesterday was my first time at soho japanese restaurant so good that i went back today i had my friend order as she had been to soho many times and claims this spot as one of her all time favorite spots and i dont blame her their ocean trout out of this world who makes sashimi with pop rock candy chef john does yes it sounds a bit absurd but pure genius it was literally poppin and rockin in my mouth four words hydro bibb black cod amazing its marinated in a miso glaze so it gives the fish a sweet finish they re serve in little cute butter lettuce cups a definite new favorite yellow tail sashimi was perfect its served with little tempura jalapeno and set on the sashimi each bite pure heaven all of their sashimi is the freshest i ve ever had in vegas coming from hawaii i m a bit picky when it comes to where i eat my sashimi because i m used to freshly caught fish in hawaii at soho its clear that their motto is quality what draws me to this place other than the fact that their food is amazing is the customer service we were personally approached by the chef owner himself he reiterated our order and by that he was able to get a feel of what our taste buds were like he said that as a courtesy he was going to bring out a complimentary sashimi dish on the house it was a black sea bass w truffle and olive oil omg it was soooooo delicious first of all he didn t have to do that that was truly nice of him to do the vibe the food and location is perfect i will definitely be back
  i usually go to the pb on mcdowell and estrella and i still prefer that location the food here is just as good and so is the service just not too fond of the layout great sandwiches soups and getting a free cookie is definitely a plus
  i love thai food they have the best yellow cury arround and a great lunch special try them all the spring rolls are good very flexible on making things gluten free and veg friendly love the staff and owner they are sweet and take good care of us they also have a good rewards program to keep you comming back
  a group of six friends made a late reservation for a birthday dinner we were seated immediately and the magic began the service was spot on the waitress was attentive yet unobtrusive the food was fantastic especially the duck risotto with orange cream sauce a must try if you are visiting montreal especially in the evening the garden is amazing
  waiter was hilarious ray and offered suggestions i got buttermilk pancakes with turkey bacon and scrambled eggs the pancakes were fluffy and the turkey bacon was smoky but they weren t anything spectacular the orange juice tasted like it was homemade it was very delicious 2 other people got corned beef hash mashed potatoes corned beef eggs side of hash and they gobble it up my sister got portuguese sausage with eggs and sticky rice and raved about it
  oh god i wish we had this place in vancouver bc i loved it my friend and i heard alot of good things about hash house a go go so we had to try it out knowing it was opening late at night was a plus too we went there after a long night of partying we ordered the chicken benedict and the chicken and waffles and shared both we got the chicken benny first and my lord it was amazing my taste buds were on another level my mouth is watering just thinking about it now haha this had a layering of heaven it has mashed potatoes on the bottom with a huge piece of fried chicken on top of it then hardwood smoked bacon tomato mozzarella scrambled eggs with chipotle cream sauce on top heaven shortly after we got the fried chicken waffles it has two fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower hot maple reduction and fried leeks by this time we got pretty full and only finished halfway and packed the rest to go the portions were huge and sooooo good we ended up going there twice i really wanted to go a third time haha
  this place lives up to what i v heard thus far about the best steak in town from the outside the place looks fairly sketchy on the inside the atmosphere borders between a log cabin and a 1950s supper club the waitstaff are friendly down to earth and knowledgeable tornado mixes the down to earth qualities of a supper club with touches wine and food of a high class steak house i had the 16oz ny strip it s served sizzling on a metal plate with an onion ring on the top a very nicely seasoned excellent cut of meat that was perfectly cooked also jim one of the bartenders is the best
  i suspect this may be the best secret taco deal in town jutting out oddly from the front of brulerie aux quatre vents in the middle of the interior section of jean talon market you ll find a simple family situation hot plate for heating up soft taco shells a slow cooker full of spicy pulled pork and a few small containers of black beans pickled onion and veggie options for 5 you get 3 tacos or one sandwich and they are spicy homemade and delicious there s a bowl of green salsa on a small table by the counter that is a good way to burn your tastebuds off while still experiencing flavour pleasure a mistake i make again and again tears running down my face gasping between grit teeth it was worth it
  wow this was seriously so good the chef is amazingly talented and creative the fish combos are amazing with different fruits vegetables etc the mushroom soup and brussels sprouts were also amazing complimentary amuse bouch mini sample and dessert as well we sorta did a chefs whim thing with some things off the menu some things daily specials some new pending menu items and some totally totally new things and ya wow amazing great price for value too wish i lived in vegas so i could eat here more
  george s is the real deal i eat here at least 3 times a month and we just recently had them cater our wedding the gyros and chicken pitas are fantastic and like another person mentioned the tzatsiki sauce is unmatched anywhere in the valley i ve had their falafel dolmades hummus and pita and the fried mushrooms and i would reccomend all of those the atmosphere at the restaurant is very friendly and it isn t uncommon to strike up conversations with complete strangers the price is right and i ll definitely be eating there many more times in the future
  this was the first time i ve actually ever heard of a nepalese himalayan restaurant so i was happy to know the company i was interviewing for decided to bring us here for dinner my order consisted of momocha and mumari for appetizers and khasi ko masu as an entree the momocha was basically a steamed vegetable dumpling served with a side sauce for me it tasted very much like any other vegetable dumpling so if you want to be more adventurous i d recommend ordering the mumari the mumari is a mung bean pattie spiced with garlic and ginger served with a side of yogurt sauce two other sauces that i couldn t figure out the patty was crunchy and not greasy at all adding the yogurt and the two other sauces really completed the flavor due to the creaminess and very slightly sourness of the yogurt but the freshness and earthiness of the two other sauces last i had the khasi ko masu as per the recommendation of the server khasi ko masu uses goat meat with a blend of curry and vegetables i was actually pretty excited to order this since i ve never had goat meat before and the goat that was used was farm raised in wisconsin the goat meat was tender and fell of the bone easily goat meat definitely tastes much different than any other meat i ve had but the cut of meat i was served resembled beef short ribs i would say that goat meat is like beef but much more earthier the blend of curry spices and vegetables was a nice addition to the dish adding so many layers of flavors and textures in total this place was a good find and a great place for an asian like me to experience so many different foods prepared in various ways a great place to go to if you are vegetarian as well
  my favorite pizza in scottsdale so good get it eat it love it the restaurant is awesome but you can order anything to go as well do it
  absolutely love this place owner joe is hilarious people oriented welcoming and just down right awesome portion sizes are huge the food is excellent service all around fantastic
  good banh mi and excellent coffee this is the first time i try vietnamese food and it is awesome with pho nice place but super busy customer service not nice because i had been waiting 20 minutes with my order r
  have been a returning customer since i moved to vegas since the first time i came here i was treated with awesome hospitality and lots of respect i was attended to as soon as i sat at the bar and scanned the menu i ordered myself a new castle on tap and proceeded to order a moo yang bbq d pork served atop a bed of greens and spicy dipping sauce it was delicious i ve ate this same dish in many thai restaurants and it s cool to know that there are many types of ways to make this throughout my whole visit they catered to my every need and checked up on me in a decent manner i will definitely keep going back to experience the same satisfaction i always leave with
  i needed a cake for the wedding after reading the yelp reviews more importantly the responses from the owners love it when people call out others on their bs i knew i had to check this place out my fiance and i walked in and we told an employee we needed a wedding cake right away we met with whom i m assuming was a manager and she got right down to business she went over all of options asked about colors and motifs told us about the types of cakes inquired about what size we would need and didn t try to up sell us and scheduled a tasting three days later with another employee who would be making the cake the tasting appointment came and again we were met with very professional service she told us what each sample was along with some other facts about each flavor we were given plenty of alone time to taste talk and make up our minds we went with a two later 6 and 8 tiramisu for 6 and a classic vanilla with a lemon curd center for the 8 enough for 25 people then we went over styling and were shown pictures of cakes they have already done again there was no up sell and when we originally picked out a cake that had some extra decorating costs we were told immediately and went with a simpler design that matched our wedding motif perfectly i gave them the information and phone numbers for the restaurant were the reception was being held and that was that on our wedding day we were greeted by a beautiful cake that everyone absolutely loved
  6 22 13 4 stars for my first visit to giant rustic pizza prior to my call for takeout i called to ask a few questions regarding allergy issues i have with corn does grp use corn meal in the production of the crusts how about in the oven some restaurants don t use corn meal to help add crunch to their crusts but a lot of places use it to keep the bottoms of the pizzas from sticking to the oven floor and this sadly keeps me from enjoying past favorites and from trying new places that are on everyone s list of bookmarks i m happy to report that grp does not use corn meal at all the person on the phone was very helpful in answering my questions and for those that he couldn t answer himself he offered to ask those in the kitchen who could after we hung up i continued to look over grp s webpage and decided i d order the 14 big sky cheese with five toppings for 15 plus tax i normally forgo red sauced pizzas but something told me to try one of each so i went for two orders of big sky a white pizza with ricotta spinach artichokes seasoned feta and garlic http www yelp com biz_photos giant rustic pizza scottsdale select vp28fvb81r7kbltmvv_ndw vp28fvb81r7kbltmvv_ndw and a red pizza with italian sausage pepperoni ricotta spinach and artichokes http www yelp com biz_photos giant rustic pizza scottsdale select 9qdrj92ejnoydcrh78tycq 9qdrj92ejnoydcrh78tycq i vaguely remember saying something like oh but these photos online of the crusts don t look like thin crusts to me to which the grp rep said but we can do thin crusts if you d like oh yes i do the phone rep was calm and did not seem to be in any rush and answered all of my questions this surprised me since i thought the more people they could rush orders through on the phone the more pizzas they could be baking and selling i suppose i m just like many people who are used to rude service on the phone thank you grp for being different when i walked in to retrieve my pizzas the two people at the cash registers were very welcoming and had big smiles for me greeting customers with smiles sounds so simple and yet this single act alone can make the receiver of the smile feel like a 100 the staff at grp also make it a point to open the pizza boxes to show you what your pizzas look like and to see if they meet your approval these looked and smelled amazing and when i got home i found that they also tasted divine a little too heavy on the ricotta but i will never complain about too much ricotta since i can always take some off but too little is something to whine about each pizza had their merits and i wholeheartedly recommend ordering pizzas with red sauce from here i am a die hard white pizza fan so when i tell you the red sauce is good here you better believe it during my first ten years of life in manila i ate so many sweet filipino style spaghetti and while they were delicious enough for me i do not favor sweet pasta sauce anymore grp s is very tasty tangy and zesty i also enjoyed the white pizza i recommend adding the feta for a little kick since the ricotta can be a little sweet
  great place great beer i would recommend the potato nachos great food great service yum
  had the green chile burro enchilada style with green sauce as recommended la bomba i am going to try to frequent this place in the future i enjoyed the experience plenty of customers from all walks of life businessmen families etc when i came up to the counter i was greeted by some very friendly and upbeat employees and when i asked what s good here they replied the service i totally agree about 20 for two to eat your fill and have a nice relaxing lunch on the patio at the benches even the hot ass 103f plus sun didn t seem to faze me until i was walking back to the car a phx favorite who says we don t have culture in the valley oh yeah cash only no atm grab a 20 at the circle k around the block
  a great neighborhood bar food has always been consistently good big burgers awesome nachos cold beer and karaoke on thursdays great times
  i had sliders from this glorious truck maybe two weeks ago and i am a fan i ordered the barbie and the pep pep both were very good and i recommend that everyone try it the guy at the window was very friendly and had a lot of energy which is probably good because that line gets really long it was a good thing that i got there early because the line just got longer and longer i recommend that people go on their site to find out exactly when and where the slider truck will be their site also has their menu with a description of each slider the sliders are decently priced and decent sizes i think an average eater can stomach about two and feel comfortably full they serve their pop in old school glass bottles love it they also serve candy with your meal which is so cute i love the slider truck and can t wait til i catch it again
  i m still wildly impressed with this restaurant they just can t seem to disappoint me they not only serve some of the best food in town but the people that work there truly make you feel welcome and i love that after trying to decide where to take my guests out to eat saturday night i decided i had to take them to carpe diem i just didn t want to try a new restaurant and risk being disappointed everything we ordered was perfect a cheese plate to start with and i went with the 23 filet mignon special that was out of this world there are so many options on the menu to please any vegetarian or carnivore just one more reason i love this place
  we go to this restaurant fairly regularly as it is close to home the food generally is really good they have a 2 part menu chinese food for chinese people and chinese food for americans we ve ordered from both menus but definitely prefer the traditional selections what s not good is the service there are never enough servers they tend to ignore you more than make sure everything is fine and generally are not very friendly there was a new woman tonight who was actually pretty great but only time will tell if tonight s experience was an anomaly the place is good for a casual meal and for groups as they are often accommodated
  very good i loved the turkey club sandwich the incredible hulk was somewhat misleading for whatever reason we expected it to be green and not taste like peanut butter but overall the food was great and the staff was very friendly can t wait to go back
  lunch special thalis offer a nice variety otherwise the rice dishes e g number 37 is another great option for people who enjoy tasting a little bit of everything and want to avoid the stress of deciding which curries and rice or naan to order a la carte fair prices tasty food and comfortable location
  so you know the show on food network the best thing i ever ate ya this could be on that list when it comes to sandwiches this is really hard since i recently ate at jimmyjohns which btw could make it on this list but the food the hot sandwiches so uncomplicated yet somehow so delicious just made my day surrounded by all these buffets i wondered why my friends would drag me to a sandwich shop of all places now i know why you can get your meal for under 10 and the selection is perfect from your basics like a blt which i had to a full monagu beef turkey swiss you ll find something you can sink your teeth into my friends and i each ordered something different there was enough of us that we were able to order each item on the menu o_o and let me tell you there wasn t one thing i didn t like please enjoy responsibly
  ok my personal breakfast choices in charlotte are either here denny s or ihop this place is always packed on saturdays and the food and service is great there are plenty of items on the menu for people to choose from which is great the omlettes are huge and this is not an understatement either two or three people can probably share it and it would be enough if you want to try a great b fast place other than ihop or denny s come here and you will not be disappointed
  i loved the food the salad was delicious and i had a fantastic lamb kebab and cheese pastry for the main course the ambiance was a little strange but ultimately charming and nice we were there right before the symphony and ballet were starting reservations at 6 before shows at 8 and it was super crowded the main floor was at capacity but we were told to go back through the kitchen and downstairs into the basement it was utilitarian to be sure cinder blocks plastic deck furniture but not really a problem the terrible aspect of it and the reason this wasn t more stars was the service our waitress was either dealing with all the tables upstairs as well or just didn t know what was going on because she seemed totally and utterly bewildered beyond the usual frazzled state of a busy waitress totally in over her head we were there sitting down to order at 6 15 and our main course wasn t there until around 7 20 by which time we needed to be finishing up so we didn t miss our 8 00 events i know some of this has to do with the kitchen being busy and it wasn t her fault but that was still problematic a half dozen times she came by and said it ll just be a few more minutes we ordered a hummus appetizer and she brought too few pita bread pieces and then took forever to get more this is a nice down home place and at any time other than the pre theater rush is probably a great restaurant but if you re in a rush to get to an event give yourself at least two hours
  sean s s review pretty much covered it all but i had to reaffirm the goodness of this food truck i had the spicy one with the green chile and it was very tasty though i d only give my dog about a 4 out of 5 there were so many different permutations that i could have chosen there are potentially limitless 5 star combinations possible oh did i mention that the service was great really nice people and they really aimed to please just ask and they ll walk you through all the dogs and help come up something extra special just for you all in all i really liked eating here
  time for a review update my initial oh my god there s a vegan restaurant a mile from my house infatuation is now over i live very close to lh so i go there a lot loving hut is pretty good they have some very tasty dishes spicy cha cha bbq bagutte are some of my favs and they have some not so great dishes the real reason for my drop down in stars is that it s always a pain in the arse to order what you want at loving hut you would think that a vegan restaurant would be totally okay with substitutions omissions etc as that s what vegans must do at most restaurants but no it s always a royal pain at loving hut the other day my wife wanted to try the tuno faux tuna sandwich on the baguette roll instead of sliced bread i called in to place a phone order and tried to order it i made it clear that i would be happy to pay a bit extra for the baguette bread if necessary didn t matter they would not do it no way no how i tried to bargain with the phone employee who blamed it on someone else and said she had to go check with the cook if it was possible how would it not be possible to use a different type of bread that they already have either way they would not budge at all so i couldn t get what i wanted very annoying and frustrating i ve also tried other substitutions and dish modifications and it s always a pain they no longer give free refills on iced tea citing costs which is disappointing one day i asked about the complementary appetizer soups that they give in store asking if i could get it for to go orders the employee i spoke with explained that they don t give it out on to go orders because of soup container costs but if i brought in my own soup container they d be happy to give me some so the next time i placed a to go order i brought in a little plastic soup bowl and requested some they barely gave me any soup in it and they gave me a hard time about it bottom line is that they need to be better at providing what the customer wants and less about penny pinching as it is very annoying and it does not make me want to go back changing up the menu by offering unique limited time dish specials would also greatly improve the place as much of the menu seems to be very similar the same flavored soy protein is in just about everything hoping they can improve
  awful almost no cheese and what was on it was barely covering the tip of the slice incredibly grumpy staff i should have walked to another concourse but i didn t have much time concourse b1 14 is the orphan concourse now so many better options for food in other concourses well at least the slice was hot
  this review is strictly for the jive turkey turkey burger we come here pretty regularly and thought the tasteless turkey burgers on last visit was a fluke wrong we tried them again and they had not a lick of salt seasoning on them what happened boo on pinky s please tell the cook s that poultry lacks much fat and needs seasoning really enjoy crab puppies beef burgers cocktails and salads but need them to get that bird right
  i m a fan of all the wildflower bread companies and this one hits the same expectations my favorite sandwich is the sweet potato sandwich it sounds kinda odd but it is delicious roasted sweet potato with mozzarella figs arugula and balsamic vinaigrette so good pair a half of one with a cup of soup or small salad for a perfect lunch this location gets incredibly busy over the lunch hour so get there early or be prepared to rush the last open table even as busy as they were service was very good for this kind of partial service establishment there was someone to clear dishes bring butter bring a takeout box etc as needed the bathroom seems disproportionately nice compared to the restaurant which is not a complaint i like that there are real doors on the stalls
  this new location of duckworth s is right down the street from my office so when i wanted to meet a friend for a holiday dinner it seemed the natural choice there was a little bit of a wait but that s to be expected the week of christmas other than that we had a great time duckworth s atmosphere is like pretty much any other new style beer and burgers joint think hickory tavern etc however in my opinion at least duckworth s far outshines the competition probably the coolest thing about the place is its large and diverse draft beer selection the fact that our waitress was very knowledge about the list and could speak about anything we were interested in was a huge plus the food was good too i ordered a carolina burger with chili and slaw which is one of my favorite ways to eat said food item it hit the spot i will be back to duckworth s
  i had high hopes for this place as it s name led me to believe that i would be served a heaping traditional hoagie however i think what the place means by original is a hoagie long after it was filled with fresh and delicious foods yet before it was expanded upon by places like subway the tuna hoagie i received was made on a white bread roll no different from one i could get at a safeway and was filled with the same type of tuna salad chopped lettuce and no taste cheese you get at subway only with none of the varied add ons that make subway doable so if you re looking for a pre corporate but post interesting hoagie like many of the middle aged people on lunch break here i guess you ve found the place for you but there are many better sandwich places nearby it s rare that i prefer a chain over a local place but original hoagie makes an exception to the rule
  stopped here before attending a fight in the mgm grand garden arena this place has lower prices and is open more hours than most of the other celebrity chef places i sat at the bar and had a beer and the crab cake appetizer it included 4 small crab cakes which were awesome i followed that with some sort of pita not wanting to break the bank with a larger entree in addition to the appetizer and the pita was pretty good you can tell that the prices hours service and quality of this place are popular with semi regulars to the strip as the people at the bar sitting next to me included a camera man for the fights and two other guys who were there with the press or a sponsor so this is the sort of high end working mans gourmet dining option of choice the atmosphere service and value were great and the hours make this an excellent place to stop for a lunch or late late lunch before attending an event or while taking a break from a meeting or conference
  i have not been back but i might because henry the owner was gracious to leave a response to my feedback in my mind if he has the sincerity to reach out to me i should reciprocate by giving them a second chance i hope to try htk again soon
  my family loves noodle saw the great reviews and pictures for noodle man a few weeks ago then forgot about the name spent an hour looking for the place and was excited with the expectation of great noodle maybe too excited the mongolian pancake was excellent of the three noodles we ordered lan zhou beef noodle soup was the best slightly spicy and refreshing homemade zha jiang noodle was also good with distinct taste of the sauce hot spicy noodle was too spicy there was way too much peppercorn which overwhelmed the other component if you are a fan of peppercorn you will like it otherwise stay away from that one as far as the noodle itself is concerned it is good but not quite what i expected for hand pulled noodles overall we enjoyed it there and would recommend any noodle lovers to try the place
  we were hungry we were thirsty we were starving for football so we went here for happy hour on a saturday just to give a new place a go ended up getting pretty plastered but was a great time had awesome sushi and watched some college football bartender was very friendly knew her drinks and made them well the sushi was in decent serving sizes and was very good the bar has a decent alcohol selection too we able to make all the drinks and shots we thought of will 100 be going back
  wow food made fresh food made well very tasty had the parrillada tampequeno mmmmmmmmmm habanero salsa was good but not hot as some have said yea my kids say my tastebuds are warped bob had the chicken fajitas he said they rocked the guac was very good
  amazing pho i was almost drinking the broth with a straw lol the vermicelli bowl was outstanding as well will be back for the bahn mi sandwich this weekend if you like pho try it here
  i work for a hotel near the biltmore and i send all of my guests to blanco because i know they re going to come back satisfied the environment is clean fresh and friendly i recommend folks here in confidence because this is a restaurant that maintains standards and the food is delicious the flavors all come together local ingredients used and match well with the vast selection of margaritas sangria etc i brought some friends one afternoon and the service was superb i was really happy as a guest and i love finding great places to eat five stars to blanco keep it up
  if only zero stars were an option my boyfriend and i saw this place while driving by and thought we should try it out as we live right down the street when we walked in we both really needed to use the restroom and the woman there who said she was the owner completely overreacted over it while i understand she wants to reserve the restrooms for paying customers i thought it was rude and extremely unprofessional in the manner and language at which she used to handle the situation when i came from the restroom and looked at the menu i saw more than a few things that looked really good but i ll never know because my boyfriend informed me of her outrageous behavior we decided to leave having no point to prove and feeling insulted we do not look like some bums off the street that can t afford lunch and she exclaimed ha i knew it as we walked out what a disappointment
  best chicken wings around the sweet tea is amazing the only negative is that it is always so crowded it can be hard to find a seat
  we went to claim jumper after an imax movie with another couple just for dessert they got us right in i have a nut allergy and could not eat any of the desserts because they contained nuts the only thing i could eat was a sunday and it was nasty oh and not impressed with the coffee
  well the view is obvious i mean it is decently high up and gives you a good view of downtown but i don t know the view from the arizona club is better we went here after watching a show at the herberger and i was expecting some high class expensive dining that that is exactly what i got the service matched the price tag which was nice to see but the restaurant itself was disappointing not only did they not have coke or dark rum but they let poor ashley a order a prime rib and then told her they were all out i had the drunken shrimp and they were pretty excellent the sauce around them was really good and they were resting on a piece of toast disguised as a crostini i also had a few bites of the lava cake but since it was buried under a pound of powered sugar i couldn t eat any more i guess i just agree with beth s s review i m just not seeing what justifies the price the district in the sheraton next door is a restaurant in a hotel that has amazing food that is priced better than this plus the view there isn t half bad
  wow i ve been really fond of the restaurants i ve visited lately i think i ve been so surprised by the awesome places in obscure locations i never thought i d ever visit not that scottsdale is obscure but it is still unexpected and we chose lon s without much local help it was a total shot in the dark went on a monday night the place was empty but it was still charming the story is that the location was actually lon s house he lived in the early 1900 s and has been remodeled into a restaurant it s in a residential neighborhood but has complementary valet and also huge patio areas if you can take the heat not us clearly ha the service was great because the restaurant was deserted and we got both waitresses the bread basket was overflowing with 4 different kinds of bread we had prosecco to drink which i looooveeeeeeee for an appetizer i had the house salad which has toasted pecans blue cheese crumbles and a prickly pear vinaigrette dressing perfect proportion of dressing to salad for dinner my mom and i split the special which was grouper with a peach and cilantro salsa on a big bed of garlic mashed potatoes our bill total came to about 75 and lon s was definitely the right choice so good
  second time i was there to entertain business guests excellent service and great view of the strip tasty food though a bit pricey of course that s expected in vegas nowadays
  i wandered into this downtown hang out one thursday to have coffee with a friend it was evening and apparently it was open mic comedy night 1 for comedy so bad it was good 1 for good coffee 1 the guy in the superhero costume 1 a manager finding seats for us to use 1 not being a stupid bar 1 for my cup bottom giving out and spilling all over i think this place is pretty nice i don t don t go downtown that often and i like to avoid the hipster places with overpriced stuff it wasn t hipster y at all diverse group crowd hecklers were mean but they didn t seem like they had much going on their lives
  this is one of our favorite chinese restaurants to dine when in pittsburgh we have had numerous items on the menu and you can t go wrong the sauces are all great the food is fresh and the quantity is large also everything is served hot temperature which is a big pet peeve of mine so i love it here you could easily share one entree but we like the leftovers for lunch service is excellent and prices are reasonable this could be a place you easily walk or drive by and think nothing of it but you should take the time and search it out you won t be disappointed
  service was great and food delicious the serving was great potion and i recommend highly
  i agree with the last post the new location on sportsworld drive is very nice and the selection is awesome i recommend ye s for any sushi lover
  this is the kind of place that looks like it would be exceptional but doesn t quite deliver tried it twice and both times were ok the place looks cool and the staff and clientele look cool as well crab cakes were good salmon tartar just ok tuna tartar was very oily the second time around had the trio of mini burgers they were good but not worth the return visit if anything hachoir is a good first date place for people with some extra cash to burn
  service was so slow it almost didn t happen after about 45 minutes wait our order came incomplete which took the waitress another 10 minutes to grab the rice that came with our dishes and 2 forks when we were sat down in the beginning we asked for a high chair didn t get it until our son grabbed the bowl of hot soup placed too close to him and then i finally asked someone else to get the high chair for us the green soup is delicious but our 2 other orders were taken home to be fed to our dogs the shrimp with chinese peas and hong kong steak terrible over salted and lacked any other taste to it than that hong kong steak looked like a patty from a frozen meal at the grocery store there were a lot of other families there but it wasn t full would hate to see how service is when it s full all in all in my opinion it s not worth the hour or the 30
  3 stars for their food 4 stars for their service and beer menu i enjoy eating here though it is not the tastiest joint in town the service makes it feel like a good hometown spot
  absolutely delicious the service was spot on and their timing was impeccable the chef was featuring egg free ravioli and it was easily the best handmade pasta i ve ever tasted aside from marcellino s just delish i highly recommend this spot
  great mexican treats and raspados i recently had the diablito raspados which is spicy and refreshing at the same time another favorite of mine is the tostilocos stop in next time you re in daslope and get your grub on at anyojitos mi pueblo they never disappoint
  somehow i felt like the waiter was annoyed he never offered a refill our waters the food was tasty but it got cold quick asked for spicy sauce got sirachi
  i miss bon chon and was so excited to check out this place the wings are pretty meaty and enough sauce for me i got the wings 10 soy sauce garlic and 10 sweet spicy more sweet than spicy they re just super cornstarchy or something that makes you feel full after 3 wings and the drumstick of the wings were dry i always prefer the wing parts though i did not like the radish it was very watery making the radish mushy
  i really don t know where to start it was not a good experience at all the food was totally mediocre to say the least what there was of it there was 4 of us and the serving of all the items especially the condiments was ridiculous for 4 people and in all the condiment dishes i m not kidding there was 1 4 tsp in each you couldn t even smear it on to use absolutely ridiculous our waiter david blane look alike was very rushed took away items we were not even finished with there never was enough cheese to share or chocolate for the dessert for that matter oh yes chocolate it was hershey syrup served cold and by the time it warmed up we were done or it was gone this for a average of 55 per person no beverages included so outside of thinking of a nice way to phrase this not going back ever pissed off for being taken advantage of and it was a birthday treat so much for that great experience that s a bs statement also if i ever heard of one so words of advice don t waste your time and most of all your money because you will and please mark my word you will be sorry
  yeah not that great very pedestrian i feel sorry for all the people that have paid to eat here we typically stay at ti so they give us the buffet for free great for free pretty bad if you fork over any money nothing really stands out a lot of the food has been sitting out so it either gets mushy or dry all the food is heavy with sauce cream breading cheese or grease simply put you feel pretty gross after eating here if you have the drunchies absolutely do not eat here like i did i can promise you you ll feel ten times worse
  incredible what can one say it s like eating in a master chef s house 6 stars
  loved it it s definitely not how it looks from the outside inside it s very nice inside with plenty of seating and great service the food is delicious as well i always order the chicken chimi but everyone agrees all their dishes are equally delicious great food great service
  good prices good food lots of good great desserts fantastic service featured on tv for their sliders don t keep driving stop in
  great food not just the pizza prices are ok for the amount of food u get and always is delicious mmmmm one thing though i do wish they had avacado for there sandwiches delivery was fast sometimes or at least on time better than most they communicate well and they read preparation instructions careful which means they actually get your order right yay
  i used to get my taiwanese food fix at the taiwanese fast food place inside the ranch market at the chinese cultural center but it s changed hands the quality has gone down and it s never had a pleasant area for sitting down to eat i was happily surprised by taiwan food express when i was at mekong plaza a couple of weeks ago my mouth started watering as soon as i read the menu and even though i just had lunch and i was full i had to order the pig intestine with mustard greens soup was it ever delicious simple and true to taste i can t wait to try the rest of the items on the menu esp oyster omelette i m very happy that it s so close to my son s chinese school because i have a feeling this is going to be a regular stop for us after class for dinner
  i ll have a biased opinion of any place like this what could be wrong with playing old and new school games drinking and eating all at the same place the one thing i can think of is the price on the surface this is a pretty expensive place however they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go whether or not you donate money to the make a wish foundation and if you re lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes but honestly know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available in regards to the games there s a plethora for your enjoyment although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets the last couple of times i ve gone i ve gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price mario kart anyone either way it s a really fun place that you ll most certainly have a good time at
  would be one star but for the price less than 10 after tax and tip including drink meh cheap as panda express but you can eat a variety of things
  the best part about primanti s is that it s always the same no matter which location you re at and always delicious this specific location in lebo gets it right every time they have a really awesome beer selection too because you cannot have that slaw meat and potato deliciousness without washing her down with a cold beverage really good happy hour specials too btw they do have other items on the menu besides their sandwiches but i could never just no not into anything besides what they re known for
  always great service great food lovely family run business the protein pancakes are a must highly recommend
  great little coffee shop inside sunset station have you seen their dessert case it s to die for lots and lots of donuts cakes and pies wow we ate here twice for breakfast when my close gf came to town they are friendly price is fair and the food is good the only bummer is when my gf paid and they somehow didn t return my gf s credit card we got all the way downtown to shop and had to call and yes the waitress still had her credit card well maybe we left to quickly i don t know we headed back to sunset station and security had her card whew will eat here again and again
  we decided to do a late dinner last night i had been wanting to come here since it opened and they offer reverse happy hour which is a plus for our food my husband ordered the crave burger with fries i ordered the baked mac and cheese with grilled chicken added to it we also ordered appetizers now initially our service started out great our server checked on us and brought us the apps in a timely manner when he brought our food mine came out and my husband only received his burger our server told him that he asked the kitchen to make a fresh batch of fries and that it will be out shortly that was great but why wasn t this done when the order was taken initially ten minutes or so goes by and our server comes back saying he was off but another server was taking his place he introduced her and they both left five minutes or so passed and when our new server comes by she looks at my husband and says sir can i get you anything i think to myself i m100 sure she see s me here with him so why not address us both my husband mentions his fries never came out so she goes to get them and by now i m just annoyed that she didn t address us both nor did she look at me i don t know what her deal was but honestly i was looking forward to going back with friends for happy hour now not so much besides the lack of good customer service the food for okay again i don t know if we ll go back for a second try or not it s a shame too i thought this would be a good hang out for us aside from public school
  tried to have lunch here today at 12 07 went for their signature sirloin burgers guess what they were all out and weren t making any more for awhile it was lunchtime folks and you were just open for 1 1 2 hr wow very disappointed and besides that there were many empty trays what s going on don t think we ll be back anytime soon oh yeah they lowered the price for general public but not for seniors who ever heard of just a dime lower for seniors outrageous
  i m here and i was excited to eat a sandwich from man vs food the del rey the moment i bit into it was nice and juicy i decided to smother it with the green and red hot sauce along with some valentina hot sauce it was now nice n spicy and a river of flavor busted in my mouth i was able to polish off the full sandwich and then you also and eat a burrito enchilada this time i was very full and i call to check it was cheap as hell if you re on a budget and you want to eat lots of food come here its fun to take a picture at the front of the store to show that you been to a man vs food stop
  this place was great we stopped in for lunch and the word is out because the place was packed the ice tea was great and i loved being able to chose a half sandwich and a half potato they were both huge and i couldn t finish i got the club sandwich and while hard to eat because of its size the ingredients were fresh and i really liked the russian mustard my spud was good too i got the cheese and chicken one and it really hit the spot i would try to avoid this place during prime time lunch rush 12 2 00pm as it took a while to get our food but it was worth the wait you get a free cookie when you check in
  oysters are so good i ate a dozen by myself the brussels sprouts are to die for the bartenders are fantastic but with only 2 on a friday night a bit overwhelmed
  i tried the burger lab for the first time last night after seeing some delectable pictures on instagram omg they did not disappoint it kinda looks something like a robertos when you walk in i was a little thrown off by that but the food is phenomenal we had the guacamole burger it s piled high with real bacon by real bacon i mean the kind you d cook at home crispy long strips fried in a pan as opposed to say jack in the box s tiny dried out slivers of bacon it also had some delicious sauce on there it was cheesy and the patty was juicy we also had a chocolate shake and the cajun shrimp fries mmmmmmmm those fries mm mm mm delicious with actual chunks of avocado on top chunks now if you frequent restaurants like i do and you love avocado you know how hard it is to get a significant amount of avocado on anything in this town we loved our food and we will definitely be back
  food was good but there are a bit pricey for pizza i had the luxury of trying pieology a similar pizza concept in california i was hoping this place would be just as good as pieology it definitely wasn t i would go back again but definitely not routinely
  just went this weekend so the info is current best steak and eggs deal in vegas period 4 95 from 11pm to 11am don t look for it on the menu it s not listed and it s not going to be on their billboard outside best full rack of ribs deal in vegas period 11 99 from 4pm to 11pm for a full rack of bbq ribs with corn beans and coleslaw if you re so inclined you can get the 1 2 rack for 7 99 or for a dollar more you can get their 1 2 rack 1 2 chicken deal for 8 99 i m all about the ribs though so full rack every time baby

  my discovery of the year for the posterity it was elected 2nd best resto in canada by en route magazine for 2008 my love and i went to le local for my 1st anniversary and had a blast we were looking for a hip place with ambiance without being the fake merde of st laurent you know the really really expensive places where they hire models but forget to train them about service where we could enjoy creative food without being broke for the next year to come a friend recommended le local and it s now my turn to recommend it to you first of all the place is absolutely gorgeous high ceilings from an industrial past terrace stunning decor of wood glass and steel dimmed lights and an open kitchen concept the service is also to mention not the greatest i had come on what is the cost benefit of offering a young friendly couple a free glass of wine when you know it s their first anniversary but our server was cute friendly discrete and very available then the food i had the burgundy escargots cassolette mild garlic gnocchi shiitakes braised shallots bordelaise sauce and the omg salmon tartare with truffle oil and fresh lime juice the tartare was the highlight of my life i wanna go back right now i ll go get myself a peanut butter toast meanwhile
  wife and i arrived at 6 pm seated promptly waiter arrived at 6 10 brought us our drink order 6 15 never stopped by again in the interim he took food orders from 2 tables that arrived after we did left at 6 30 when we reached the door hostess said have a good evening i told her to tell our waiter that we were leaving thanks for the coke walked across to picasso s great food great service
  had to get my barbecue on today it was a late lunch and all the close places weren t open and the only open one i know of was just too far to drive on n 7th street i finally found stacey s at one time i pretty much ran all over hell s half acre looking for this place i tried indian school road and a couple of other places in phoenix that were all former stacey s bbq locations i found the real deal in what looks like a former ice cream stand next to my computer guy s storefront there is a god ordered half a slab of spare ribs cowboy beans corn bread and diet soda not only do they accept cash now they accept credit cards i hear handel s messiah in the background there s very limited seating even the smoker is outdoors i loved everything the spare ribs had nice rub and good smoke the sweet bbq sauce was a nice change of pace to a tangy sauce that was not very spicy but had a little kick to it the cowboy beans are the bbq beans with chopped jalapenos added a nicely spicy side unfortunately they were out of the corn bread diet soda came in a can btw those of you who complain about the crunchy bits in the pulled pork or brisket that is what is called bark it s one of the things that gives good barbecue it s flavor do the rest of us a favor if you don t know what the crunchy bits are stop complaining your ignorance of what constitutes good barbecue is out there for all of us to see you deserve the barbecue at dickey s in scottsdale i tried that barbecue once but never again all in all i will return with several friends to put them through their paces however i was just happy to find stacey s new location i will be back
  this place was awesome as soon as we walked in we were greeted and welcomed we were immediately seated jenny was fantastic amazing customer service brought us our drinks and took our orders right away the meals were perfectly portioned and delicious all waiters were very friendly and attentive will return recommended
  outstanding place great food and tap beers all the food is great i love the burgers and of course the steak sandwich ny strip on great bread great meal for the price point best steak sandwich i ve ever had
  service is fast and food is good but how come whenever i try to use apple pay it never works at the drive thru what s the point of introducing this technology and innovation and be complacent about fixing it or getting it to work i ve never had an issue at other mcdonalds it s either laziness on the owners part or ignorance staff is nice tho
  i love eating here if you are a salmon skin fan like i am try their salmon skin salad the sashimi is great and the staff is very nice too
  our office just moved into the area and i was looking for a decent place to have lunch with a friend and her new baby based on another friend s recommendation we gave philly s a try it was nice and quiet for a friday afternoon perfect with a baby in tow our food was delivered quickly and hot the service was excellent and our waitress was very friendly i ordered the teriyaki chicken sandwich with a side of waffle fries the sandwich was okay the chicken was a tad dry but not so bad i didn t finish most of it i d definitely give them another try
  a tasty fish taco ono and mahi mahi that makes it easy to tolerate the very cliched bob marley inspired surf ambiance that permeates the place one complaint come up with a sub 10 lunch option or two this is a lunch heavy neighborhood and that is an important cost threshold for diners
  pros their fried pickles give me life it s worth the gastrointestinal hell to come thereafter they are reasonably priced cons there is an issue with their menu on the basis of what commodities come on their burgers most cases hamburgers normally come with ketchup mustard or mayonnaise not really their fries aren t as good but they are worth it not all fries have to be caked in salt to be good i ll return because i need to find out what they use for their fried pickles
  came back to where i originally gave 4 stars to use the second part of a 2 part groupon got the pho again as that seemed to be the safe bet the broth tasted a little odd the meat had a weird taste that wasn t fresh and the worst part was that all the vegetables minus the lime were old the bean sprouts were not a crunchy white but dirty and old as though they had been in a bag in the fridge for 2 weeks it was almost embarrassing bean sprouts are insanely cheap change that out boss the leaves of the basil were turning dark in many spots and even the onion that was already in the soup when it arrived wasn t fresh even with a groupon i won t be coming back embarrassing to bring out a plate of old vegetables no more soup for me
  i ve lived in the jean talon area for the last two years and have always been curious to eat at this restaurant i waited two years too long this is going to be my new go to place when i want some cheap greasy food it was so yummy and filling i had just a good old double cheeseburger and fries and my friend had a chicken burger that is actually made out of real chicken pieces with a garlic mayo and a poutine so satisfying i highly highly recommend d
  great find for mediterranean food quaint and clean order at the counter ambiance is very casual the food is great
  had dinner with a work colleague from out of town who wanted italian food i found this place and the menu looked good they were not busy when we got there but were expecting a larger party later weirdly the sat us right next to where the large party was going to be not sure why but the placement was weird since they had other open two tops the server gave us the run down of specials we decided to split a ceasar salad and we ordered entrees the ceasar was ok could have used more dressing the bologonese ragu however was amazing some of the best pasta i have ever eaten my colleague also commented on his chicken parm and said the pasta was very good the server was very slow in picking up the check but she had gotten busy with more tables and the larger party by that time but overall it was very good and i will be back with my husband next time
  the theme park chain has pulled in this outside food source the food was acceptable but the service was ridiculously slow we ordered fries and a sprite total was 13 62 i gave the cashier 15 02 he returned the two pennies unclear on what to do with the change we watched the kitchen staff fumble to put together orders one woman could answer where the ketchup was a bottle on every table we waited for 15 minutes for one order of fries which say on a shelf just out of arms reach the whole time fries were decent but even on a slow day prepare to wait reasonable beer selection including natty greene s
  best pizza on the the southeast side of town located in a fairly old shopping center on gibson off of the 215 you wouldn t expect this kind of quality from this unlikely place it s tucked right behind a gas station in a residential area we found this place because we wanted an alternative to the high priced grimaldi s my family and i like the meatball pizza in comparison to verrazanos and new york pizza on jones and sahara bistro proves to be arguably superior however grimaldi s is still the best in vegas imo i just can t stand paying 35 for a pizza which is why bistro gets most of my business when i want a pie to sum up my review bistro is proving to be the best of las vegas and henderson for the quality you get in a bistro pizza you can t beat the value dont forget to check in and get your free garlic knots
  if you re looking for some of the best seafood in las vegas look no further from the surprisingly complex amuse bouche of mushroom mango ceviche and the alaskan king crab appetizer to the first class service by jesse and tonya the night couldn t have been better i grew up in alaska so my standards for crab are high and the chef exceeded my expectations i had the halibut which in other less deft hands can be overcooked but in this case it was perfectly seasoned and mouth watering my friends both who live far far away from oceans had the prawns and scallops and couldn t stop saying how it was the best seafood they had enjoyed in years i d highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes with thick moist succulent chunks of lobster that doesn t overpower the potatoes i d highly recommend this restaurant especially if you can get a booth which the manager min made possible for us in other restaurants it can be difficult to hear yourself think but here at aquaknox you can relax enjoy a great bottle of wine from their excellent selection consult with a knowledgeable and helpful sommelier and celebrate the good life
  been coming here since they opened everything has just gotten better and better friendly staff and delicious food don t think of it like chipotle though ingredients are predetermined you just say yes or no make sure and get some hot sauce it yummy and super hot
  i went here for the first time the other day and tried the gyro plate my son ordered the beef shawarma everything was good and the staff was very friendly and even gave us a sample of baklava they give you a lot of food for cheap prices i will be back
  i ve come full circle at comme ca happy hour drinks only happy hour drinks and food brunch and now dinner my friend and i arrived at comme ca with a reservation which i recommend at any time during the week because at one point i attempted coming here for dinner and there was a private party being held my plans were ruined however everything came to fruition a few nights ago and i dined with a friend at comme ca for dinner appetizer hudson valley seared foie gras perfectly seared amazingly rich beautifully plated comes served between a waffle and butternut squash accompanied by berries and radishes indulgent perfect main bouillabaisse of amazingness octopus venus clams gulf shrimp and mussels with a salty briny soup and two crusty pieces of bread spread with garlic butter i ate every bit i supped on the soupy goodness i scraped every morsel of meat out of every shell the shrimp were on point the octopus was tender i am in love with this dish two glasses of riesling to wash it all down lovely varietal 10 a glass comme ca yes yes yes
  great service great food and affordable price if you want to eat outside at the patio there s no reservations available you ll have to wait for at least 30 mins depending how busy it is but it is all worth it you get a great viw of the bellagio fountains while you have dinner
  this place is phenomenal high quality food combined with attentive top notch service for starters try the ginger butternut squash delicious i d also recommend the tuscan kale salad roasted root vegetables and farro for dessert the flourless chocolate cake is a must have
  i dig this place first time here was a spontaneous decision came out of q karaoke around 6a but was not ready for the night to end yet saw a sign that said food and we were reeled in first impression dim bunch of lights pretty crowded loud music got seated in a booth ordered drinks and ethiopian food that came with injera server told us their mom makes the food group liked it and even one stated it was better than merkato s overall told myself i d come back second time sat ourselves at a booth then ordered a hookah with strawberrry pineapple two longs islands and two beers let me just say i might want to smoke hookah more often it was smooth tasted good and lasted forever music gave a good vibe that night bunch of reggae and nigerian music dance floor was pretty packed good vibes were just being emitted cost us 34 for our hookah and drinks not bad at all service here is amazing they consistently make sure you re doing fine and they consistently check your hookah and replace the coal they know how to have fun too they close at 530a but will continue until people leave or the place starts to get bare definitely recommend stopping by don t be intimated i admit it s not the nicest place and there s security around last time we were there there was a guy outside with blood on his face held to the ground yikes tip be careful when you leave saw police pull up in the parking lot and was told that police come by park and end up following some people to pull over just be safe
  this is my go to pizza place my boyfriend is from brooklyn and loves it prices are reasonable the crust is a perfect combination of crunchy and soft the toppings are very fresh the service is always great and the employees are very friendly the restaurant is clean and reminds me of a little pizzeria in ny we usually order a large pizza and wings and have more than enough left over the slices are huge and very filling if you are looking for great ny style pizza in the university area this is your place
  pie area separate from restaurant great staff great pie selection and taste will be stopping by again
  very disappointed have now ordered from them 3 times apparently depending on the busy ness of the store you may or may not be in their delivery area tonight ordered online and not a problem with that part never stopped me mid transaction to say no delivery phone rings and am politely told that it s too busy and they can t delivery to my house though they did deliver here a few weeks ago very hard to find places with gluten free options so clearly happy that they had one however i ll stick with spinato s locally owned and operated gluten free option and never a delivery issue zpizza you lost my business over something as simple as delivery
  decent chinese food it as a good clean taste only thing is many of sauces on the dishes taste too similar
  so far i ve experienced 3 different chinese restaurant in madison from this place i only had lunch take out but out the 3 i think this place is the best in terms of taste the lunch takeout portion is quite generous it comes with egg roll too i d try their dinner menu when i have a chance
  i was really excited to go to this place because bobby flay owns it i had the tuna steak and it was really really good i never expected that tex mex can get this good the service was a little slow though but i m willing to overlook it for the quality of food
  i was a regular here during grad school it was the closest thing to my mother s cooking back in seattle i just didn t have time to cook for myself during finals week so i hit this place every other day i highly recommend their jung shik courses it comes with rice bean paste soup side dishes and fried mackerel fish i found this to be the most well balanced meal for those needing to meet the demands of school i have heard about the customer service being a hit or miss and that s cause you don t speak korean or you always expect amazing service without tipping well my suggestion tip well and they will remember you because i knew they were a primary supplier for my korean fix i wanted to show them i valued their business it worked they remembered what i ordered i was always seated promptly during busy times and the owners were never rude to me i often came alone and they always still cared to ask how my food was which was always great i give them 4 stars out of 5 because they close on one of the weekdays i forget which one i even forgot when i lived there so i often drove out for no good reason hah
  a stunning lounge restaurant located inside mandalay bay on the 64th floor with a great view went here with a large group of friends probably 14 of us and had an excellent time the ambiance on the lighter side and that huge dining area is so welcoming that it gives you room to breath loved the decor and the bubbly chandeliers i mean whats not nice in vegas food we got a few orders of tuna tartare cheese salami and prosciutto platter and some other appetizer cant remember k so my main 5 stars are based on the filet mignon steak with foie gras this was by far the most memorable filet i ve had cooked to perfection and the foie gras being on top of the meat gave all the oils and juices to the filet which made it more outstanding service all right normal overall if you re seeking a place that serves great steak and want to try or simply have foie gras try this place out it should impress you
  i ve been here a few times and really wanted to like it more i ve tried all their chilis a burger the sweet tea in the mason jar it was just ok i love the history and the atmosphere and the menu has a ton of potential but i just didn t think the food delivered on the comfort food taste i was looking for
  this foodie dined here with her discerning spouse and 2 local residents we were all impressed with the eclectic menu not a martini fan but we each found one that peaked our interest and enjoyed them the wine list was small but sufficient the short ribs w polenta and shrimp and shrimp with scallops appetizers were outstanding the jambalaya new york strip and chicken penne were all winners staff and patrons were friendly and helpful owner jose was gracious and appreciative prices were very reasonable the strip steak was half the cost of the name chef steakhouses on the strip and every bit as good looking forward to returning on our next visit
  awesome place love the atmosphere the staff and overall the environment got a bottle of wine and some crazy good mexican cuisine a go to when you re in the mood for mexican food and a good time two thumbs up
  food and service was fantastic but it was so over priced i am not a fan of paying 15 95 for a small pep pizza that barely feeds 1 hungry person the caesar salad was a large and again really wasnt too filling and was 12 bucks attention owners i get that you serve good gourmet pizza but holy smokes lower your prices
  when i was a kid me and my dad and grandma would go to here a lot we left feeling good a lot we once went here for thanksgiving much to my dismay this location closed and might be demolished
  the food here was delicious i was looking forward to trying the frozen hot chocolate that i have heard such great things about including from yelp reviews i was really disappointed with it after dining in for our meal we decided to pick up a frozen hot chocolate from the on the go area outside so we could drink it while walking around i honestly wouldn t recommend the it unless you are incredibly curious about it and are dying to try it
  4 stars just for the face this joint as frozen margarita s and beers for 2 00 that alone is 4 stars didnt eat but sat at the bar alone with a few drinks nice bartender will go back again when in town hard to find 2 00 drinks on the strip
  great atmosphere fun place drinks are kind of pricey so wouldn t make this a regular spot but i had a great time
  don t get me wrong this is not a gourmet restaurant but it s not supposed to be if you want some of the cheapest most delicious mexican food in pittsburgh this is where you want to be it s an unassuming unattractive restaurant front on forbes ave but do not let appearances fool you this is one of the few places left i know of that can give you a delicious filling meal for under 5 bucks i ve been eating the same thing grande grilled chicken chili quesadilla for almost two years now and i will never get sick of it they give you an automatic 10 discount if you look like a student which you can t beat plenty of hot sauces to try on your food as well my absolute favorite place to eat lunch quickly in oakland if you don t know what to get know that the grande grilled chicken chili quesadilla has a very good shot at changing your life
  the kiki burger is hands down the best burger i ve ever had delicious mushrooms juicy burger gruyere cheese garlic aoli all on a soft hawaiin sweet bun add that with a side of oxtail chili cheese fries and appetizer of pork belly buns and you have a meal so rich in flavor that the trek off the strip is 100 worth it i ve been to bachi twice first time was at the other location and have been thoroughly satisfied with both my experiences i don t remember the service at the other location but this location had superb service very attentive with ordering clearing dishes and refilling water what more can you ask for definately for me a must go every time i m in vegas honestly i m not sure how far off the strip both the locations are because we had a rental car and have local friends but if you have a chance go here
  by far best sushi in las vegas they pride themselves on traditional edomae sushi i e tokyo style where they apply the perfect amount of sauce and wasabi for you fish is extremely fresh and flown in daily from japan southern california uni and boston scallops they have a good assortment of premium fish and the itamae is very skilled with the knife the restaurant is hard as bones to locate but that s part of the appeal i d say the clientele was 75 japanese it s definitely high end but not overly so for las vegas this is an omakase chef s choice sushi restaurant and that makes it even better i went with the kabuto omakase and here s a high level run down of the delicacies palette cleanser chef s homemade sake sorbet perfect if surprisingly ight beginning 5 pieces of shellfish sashimi highlight here was the tako deliciously tender and they included the sucker presentation was in a clam shell they had just opened 5 pieces of sashimi exotic fishes from japan two different types of medium fatty tuna one from the belly and one near the fin that began with a k and was my favorite piece of the night they took note of that later grilled plate fantastic seared pieces of sushi including kobe beef i usually sigh in disappointment during the cooked portion of an omakase but this was perfect and not too heavy sushi course they serve edomae style so one piece at at time this is especially important since they use warm rice i tried every piece of fish left on the menu pacing was especially well done and the chefs provided the right amount of information without going overboard no pun intended miso soup there are two choices bone in fish or mushroom i went with the mushroom and it was some of the most delicious i have ever had i like ending with miso soup this was a good sign we re talking classic omakase dessert course a number of options all handmade by their japanese pasty chef strawberry mil crepes and of course mochi ice cream were tempting but i went with the apple sorbet which they topped with a touch of gold leaf this was refreshing and light and thus didn t make me feel too gluttonous the itamame seems to be a good guy and he cracked some jokes with the audience the restaurant is extremely clean and has a zen vibe to it this is the perfect type of omakase for me but if you re more of a sushi of gari i e lots of sauces more fusion more cooked dishes you might get bored presentation of some of the sashimi plates could have been more artful my glasses were refilled adequately but a touch slow otherwise best japanese dining experience easily in las vegas if not in the whole southwest to be frank the mainstay is the sushi bar but it s not overly stuck up in the sense they have tables and even a booster seat for kids
  i can t comment on any of the regular menu food i came for a specific purpose frozen hot chocolate i was not disappointed we got it to go and drank it on the nice warm patio outside it was fantastic the place seems like it could get fairly busy the outside line that we were in moved fairly quickly the staff wasn t terribly friendly but i think their main focus was efficiency i will definitely be back
  easily one of my favorite little places absolutely lovely and the owner always remembers me even if i don t visit as often as i d like
  yes i agree fellow ny er here says this restaurant has some of the best ny pizza in town they also catered my brother s rehearsal dinner and all the food was great sausage and peppers yummy update 6 25 11 walked in last night to catch steve benson spinning the cd s and drawing caricatures hello not missing that gig me wow you remodeled the place liz the wonderful superstar waitress yeah nine years ago hahahaahahah pweewwt i guess i have been eating mostly take out or catering from them over the last few years lol the place looks beautiful and the food is outstanding the owner is from smithtown ny and i love her and this place manga ps hello did i mention steve benson was there again did i mention steve benson does first friday s there you can get a caricature done by none other than steve benson oops i m sorry did i mention steve benson is there once a month on fridays dj ing and drawing d and d lol being politically motivated involved and an executive member of aea i was in heaven i love my teacher caricature check it out fun times
  my wife and i love this place great salsa bar tacos and burritos not your average mexican beans and rice kind of place
  great place especially for happy hour 3 7 m f and they have a late night happy hour that starts at 10pm i think they have beer specials martinis are 5 95 and almost every appetizer is half off i have never had a bad meal here some of the entrees are pricey but the food is good
  on veterans day we knew just about every buffet especially station casinos would be packed to the brim with folks especially our deserving veterans who all got to eat for free at a number of local buffets if i was a vet i would have been livin it up all day at the buffet comped meals for breakfast lunch dinner eating 100x better than gambling we decided to go to the farthest local buffet we could think of that may have a tinier crowd that day what a trek just to go to the medley buffet at aliante driving there alone on 215 makes it seem like you re going to another city the line at the medley buffet was hardly any different even at a late lunch the line was still near full lots of vets wearing their military hats or shirts ready to eat with their ids out it was a glorious site to behold these folks fought for our freedom and were now fighting beside us for the next open spot at the buffet really it was a madhouse i can only imagine what the other more central buffets were doing frickin crazy took us about 30 minutes to get to the front of the line then a small wait for a table luckily there were only 3 of us in our party so we didn t have to wait long many tables had large families on them all celebrating with at least 1 vet on them man daddy how i miss you so wish you were with us on this day to help celebrate what you did for the good ol u s of a armyvet the lines for food at the buffet were constantly flowing with folks in and out i overheard one of the sous chefs who had been there since 5 am prepping that by the end of breakfast they had served over 1000 people already that in itself is a battle and it was only lunch time it was good to see vets enjoying time with their grateful families but i do have to knock some stars for the quality of food at the medley buffet come on guys vets coming in how about you up the ante eh put on that extra burner to give not just quantity but some extra lovin quality a lot of the food on the lines were short on tlc some of it looked like it was made in a rush sloppily to satisfy hungry patrons some of it just sat under the heat lamp too long hello fish fillets and took a beating and what is up with the asian station it s like a half hearted attempt to put some sorry looking stir fry out just mediocre for the most part i stayed away from the buffet stations that were getting the least attention by eaters the asian the italian most of the foods there just looked like it sat too long wasn t changed out in a timely manner marinara sauce got a slight crust over the top pass majority of what i chose to eat came from the american station and the mexican station food seemed the freshest there because of the high foot traffic things i like the most that day were the turkey i got me an entire leg and the tacos with carnitas those tacos were pretty tasty i had like 8 of them for some reason i also grabbed a chicken nugget from the food line and unfortunately the ones from mcdonald s even wendy s are better i passed on a lot of the other options available desserts didn t appeal to me nor did their salad bar their bbq station was a pass for me too even though i thought about a fresh grilled cheeseburger but as i watched one being made why grill maestro why did you not put the buns on the grill with a pat of butter that is crucial for a great burger ugh service was good and our server was very friendly even though she had a billion tables that day she fell behind on our drinks but made sure to apologize when she did come around for refills no knock on her for being super busy a vet takes precedence over my needs just about any day of the week nicest thing i can say about the medley buffet at aliante was the price even for veterans day price for entry was only 8 99 for lunch with the aliante players card if you didn t have the card it was only 1 more wallet friendly for sure will we be back probably but it may take some convincing or a bogo free coupon to lure me back to aliante in my opinion it was much better when aliante was still owned by station casinos and this used to be a feast buffet on the upside though the slot machines may now be looser now than when station casinos was the owner i won our buffet money back with the 7 i had leftover in my pocket breaking even can sometimes be the greatest thing don t forget kids veterans are one of the main reasons you i can rant rave on yelp today freedom
  i used to love cork and i ve wanted to continue to love it but the last vew visits have demonstrated a massive decline in the level of service i ve been probably 6 or 8 times in the past year and only half the time did we receive the quality of service that i felt thier price point warranted most recently i took a new friend there for brunch for the first time by the end of the meal we were both in a terrible mood our waitress had sucked so bad examples after sitting down it took the waitress a full 15 minutes before taking our order it took another full half hour for the food to arrive yes they were busy but there were empty tables too other people who arrived after us had their orders taken quickly they had the best waiter there and were already paying thier tab leaving at the time our food arrived my date had to ask 3 times for cream sweetener for his coffee it finally arrived 15 minutes later when the coffee was cold glad i drink mine black our food arrived cold he ordered wheat toast w his meal the waitress didn t bring the toast until he was nearly done eating and when plopping it down white toast simply stated we re out of wheat then split i ordered a biscuit w my meal it was tooth breakingly hard like a hockey puck the waiters typically offer freshly ground pepper this waitress did not in fact she brought no condiments at all to the table no butter jelly nothing when we asked for salt and pepper she simply plopped a salt shaker no pepper on the table and hurried away because i have been there many times and the manager recognizes me i spoke to him about the service before i could even say much of anything he immediately launched into i know the service could have been better we re having an off day a few people called in sick we re short handed blah blah blah it was all a big whine of excuses you know what their being shortstaffed didn t cause our waitress to be shitty her attitude did and if they were truly shorthanded then why wasn t his lazy ass helping out all i saw him doing through our entire meal ordeal was leaning on the bar yukking it up w other workers who also didn t seem to have much to do thankfully most of their food continues to be delicious that s a plus and if you get their very best waiter wish i remembered his name he s worked there since day 1 then it s an awesome dining experience i live walking distance so i ll likely return at some point but for folks who live a ways away might as well steer clear
  needed an indian food fix my friend is 6 months pregnant and craving indian food so went here as it was the closest at the time it was pretty good i had the chicken tikka masala and some kind of yummy korma my friend really liked the dessert which was some kind of fruit pudding i myself would rather have kheer ras malie or that indian dessert that is made out of carrots not sure of the name however i really enjoyed the chicken tikka and the korma and i felt the service was great especially since we had a toddler with us the waiter was so friendly and helpful with the toddler and i was impressed by that and the fact that he kept our water glasses filled and had a smile on his face the whole time super friendly service a service i will definitely be back the only thing i think needs improvement is keeping the buffet re stocked that is why i am giving 4 stars instead of 5 stars
  place was bomb got to create my own delicious concoction of my favorite middle eastern freshness it s definitely a chipotle for middle eastern food this place is on my list of go to s from here on in absolutely yummy
  this was my favorite classy restaurant in tempe when i went to asu i didn t like the old location at all it was too small the new location is way way better i especially like it in the back it s nice and private the shrimp adriatico is delicious i always got the meat lasagna and it is so good i miss it the sangria is good too when they have live music it gets insanely loud inside so try to sit outside if they do
  first time here on my birthday love that they let me use my free appetizer and free dessert on the same visit great happy hour menu with too die for chicken wings a great spicy and zesty taste to them the arcadia salad is light and filling probably because i ate 7 chicken wings before but seriously very good flavor side of green chile mac n cheese which you can get as a meal was good but could have used a bit more of a kick love the history of the building and like that it is not very noisy
  see this is exactly the reason why i love yelp reviews are spot on and have always given great advice unfortunately i didn t check the reviews on this restaurant before coming in it was a spur of the moment thing went to go have dinner at bjs next door and noticed a flyer on urban grill saying they were broadcasting the pacquiao bradley fight for free sold we went in were seated promptly and advised they were going to do a raffle for a pair of seats to the fight at mgm only catch is you have to buy a 20 5 beer bucket sold again we didn t win the raffle anyways our beer arrived in a bucket of ice two were cold and the other three felt like they were baking in the sun who gives out hot beer that s just wrong we nursed the two cold ones until the other three were bearable to drink didn t have an option anyways because 30 minutes passed before the server arose from the deep after ordering our food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time not by the server and for the next 90 minutes our server was mia the server decided to briefly stop by and see how things were then disappeared for another 60 minutes the saving grace here was the food which was good not unbelievable but pretty good we were entertained by the fight during this time so that kept us preoccupied from the absence of the server we absolutely will never visit this place again obviously there s something wrong here that no one is addressing and that s unfortunate because there is so much potential
  we visited about 4 months ago and had a less than favorable experience after i left my previous review management contacted me and asked that i give gallagher s another visit they insisted that our experience that night was not typical and asked that we revisit the restaurant after they addressed issues with the staff we returned last night and were if course hyper aware to the issues we saw in june we wanted a good bottle of wine and our questions were a little outside of the expertise of our waitress the sommelier was very patient and when given our price range recommended a bottle at the low end of our range he was spot on with the wine a large party was seated next to us and service did not suffer in the least all in all this was the kind of great service we expect when visiting a nice restaurant let s just chalk the june visit up as a bad night that was the exception rather than the rule service was great and the food is exceptional we ll be back
  hmmm decent sandwiches fast service i d say nice to take to munch on by the pool but this is the only place that sells whoopie pies that i know of in vegas which is awesome however the pies arent up to par but still cool that its sold here all in all try it and decide for yourself
  que ricooooooooooooooo we picked up a couple of late night burritos after playing galaga of course and were sooooooo happy sure the place was a little sketchy at 1 am but who cares the burritos were delicious they had the perfect blend of spice rice cheese beans and meat i don t care that they re a chain the food s good
  just come here it is sooooo good simplicity right
  12 99 for a huge cute of slow roasted prime rib and baked potato plus it comes with a mother fucking beer too granted it may take a while to get seated but you can fill your time watching sports gambling or getting drunk with your friends don t expect the wynn though cause its old school up in hur but the food and beer make the trip worthwhile and for those of you complaining about it being too far away its located just off koval and paradise which means its only a stones throw paris ballys planet hollywood and is as close as you can get to the strip without being on the strip and hello did you read the first line of my review 12 99 prime rib baked potato and beer lots of it too and they re dirt cheap all beers are brewed on premise are only 1 75 for 20 ounces of ice cold goodness now if that s not enough to sell you on this place come for happy hour when its only a buck
  this place is wonderful the food was excellent and the owners were so sweet i already want to go back
  excellent thin crust oven baked pizza jeff and his staff do a great job love this place
  if you are a tourist this is probably one of the best options on the stip to go and dance latin music however if you are a local i would not recommended this restaurant bar has two floors the first floor has the restaurant area where you can eat next to the dance floor they play r b rap and a little bit of everything the problem is that is next to the patio so i don t think they have ac or if they do is extremely hot i promise you i m not on my menopause yet and i was sweaty on the second floor they play latin music the dance floor has a decent size but i went on a saturday night and there was hardly anyone there so if you have better option i would totally go somewhere else
  my favorite sandwich place when i moved from d c to arizona i was sad to no longer be able to eat at potbelly and then they opened two locations my favorite sandwich is the turkey and i love their salads too the hot peppers are hot and i love them the line always moves really quickly but as other reviewers have noted parking in this location can be problematic
  iso great mexican food that s quick a hop skip jump away and is inexpensive but not in the i ate berto s drunk last night and it s not the booze that left me feeling like crap way this place is pretty dive y and at first glance you d think meh nothing to write home about don t judge a book by it s cover mi patio serves up classic mexican fare with a greek twist the first time i got the complimentary chips and salsa i was sold and might i mention that it s bottomless we d be halfway finished with a bowl of chips and someone would be making rounds to give us more the margaritas are pretty standard i m not a huge margarita drinker but i always order one when i come here why not it s only 1 75 i know what you re thinking hold the phone 1 75 was it happy hour nope it s all the time usually when i go i ve ordered the veggie burro on my most recent visit the special was fish tacos this girl is a huge fan of those the portions here are huge especially with the burros i usually power halfway through because it s so good i can t stop eating and then am stuffed they seem to make the food at record pace and all of the ingredients taste fresh the fish tacos i ordered were so tasty i had never had them with fresh taco shells mmm mm good plus the beans and rice which is always delicious i d probably eat here every day if i could or if it were particularly healthy
  on 2 2 10 my party of three came to champion gourmet for the hot pot we found it disappointing the atmosphere sucked the place was cluttered and run down with a television blaring chinese language soap operas at full volume for the entire meal we had to get our own water from a water cooler with dinky styrofoam cups we experienced a severe language barrier with the wait staff which in of itself is not a deal breaker but in conjunction with everything else made the bitter icing on an already crappy cake our hot pot took a long time to come to the table we ordered the spicy broth with lamb as our main protein a plate of enoki mushrooms squash corn on the cob cabbage zucchini tofu and noodles was included with the lamb gratis we also ordered some shrimp dumplings clams and squid balls the lamb was great no complaints there the veggies were fine too and the squash was surprisingly delicious however the shrimp dumplings were truly disgusting they tasted and smelled like low tide oh my word were they fishy and briny they stank up all our soup they tasted so amazingly bad i couldn t determine if that was their intended flavor or if they d simply gone rancid and the clams were no better i couldn t believe how rank they were the squid balls kept me from losing all faith in this place s seafood they were chewy and mild with a slightly sweet flavor even though the wait staff was sitting in the same room as our party they were too busy watching the tv to attend to us whatsoever i had to walk up to one of them and physically tap her on the shoulder to get her to take our second order more lamb and more noodles i was afraid that we might get food poisoning from the seafood but my friends and i seemed fine all evening i ve had better hot pot at a chinese buffet in saint louis missouri i won t be back
  nori may be on of my new favorite sushi places in phoenix i was a bit skeptical walking in here the other night and had pretty low expectations because of its location in desert ridge but alas i was pleasantly surprised and had an absolutely fantastic meal here drinks food and service were all on point for dinner we ordered a bit of everything we started off with some nigiri tuna salmon and yellowtail all 3 selections featured surprisingly fresh fish and the rice was cooked perfectly it wasn t gummy and didn t fall apart the seaweed salad was solid for rolls we ordered a poki poki which featured their house speciality tuna poke and crab it was recommended by our server as one of her favorites and she didn t disappoint soft shell crab roll was flavorful as was the salmon skin roll we ordered a bottle of their unfiltered sake which was placed in an ice bucket on the table to ensure that it was kept cool and their strawberry lemonade martini was to die for i will def be back
  this is not the first time i ve been to the steak n shake i have been here with my family several times over the years needless to say service is never great but last night was the boiling point we got to steak n shake around 7 o clock pm and waited 30 minutes to be seated then waited another 15 minutes before anyone came and took our drink orders then waited 17 minutes before we got our milkshakes and another 22 before we got our food now you would think the restaurant was slam packed but it was not there were about four other tables than ours and about 15 people working i do not know what the problem is other than the time the drive thru and it seems all of their concern for customer service goes to that because it s being reported back to their corporate office by the time we got out it was after 9 p m and everyone was less than happy there was a line to speak to the manager as everyone in the restaurant was very upset with the quality of service the food wasn t bad but with all of the frustration of service it s hard to enjoy so if you re looking for good food fast go somewhere else
  wow just wow my firs second and only second complaint still the same complaint really so i went back today hoping to redeem my views they were simply reinforced even though yelp is most definitely a place for opinions i will try my best to be as factual as possible i hate for one bad experience or one bad employee to ruin an entire restaurant for me but that s the way it s looking heck that s the entire reason i went back tonight don t let one bad apple spoil the bunch to be a good sport heck i even tipped my normal rate again tonight because i am still trying to see the positives well i ll start with that the good as usual the food was outstanding we were not only served by katie who i will get to in a second but also by a gentleman in the back who quite possibly the only man to receive a hypothermia injury in las vegas he was polite friendly and still hobbled over providing us with great service in spite of his leg injuries the place was a little busier on the bar side of things tonight the bad katie oh lord katie my girlfriend and i came back hoping to amend things for some perspective we have both worked in the service industry before mostly retail so we try to keep that in mind seriously i am at a loss for words for your tact yes management did try to get in touch with me since my last visit and review however they never left a message leaving me to believe they were telemarketers i also work at a hospital so once i realized who was calling me i tried to call back asap i do not have the luxury of being able to answer my phone immediately at work so i d end up speaking to someone else who didn t know the situation or why they were being called okay katie came over reminding us that management tried to call we gave the above explanation and this time gave them my girlfriend s number for contact she can be bothered to answer the phone more than i and honestly i m done we ordered and started to eat served by the gentleman i mentioned above it was busy in the bar area so i won t jump to conclusions and say she was avoiding us she asked if we had come again for another round to complain i replied that no this was our first time coming in since you last saw us it must have been someone else to her credit she did let slip one i m sorry around this point but then and i can t believe this katie actually got out her tablet and brought up my first review on yelp she said and yes this time i am quoting you are brett right yes see i just don t know why someone would make up such lies like what i don t know i haven t read the whole thing but kristi previously referred to as jane in my older review is my friend and like here you said the table was dirty it was not and i just i don t know why someone would say such lies and she went on to use my girlfriend s word harassing us like this wow when i worked service and someone was upset you apologize you try to make it better the customer is always right you don t stand there rehashing old crap and trying to prove that you re right but she did she kept digging that grave our food came it was still outstanding and will be missed the gentleman from the back continued to be a pleasant gentleman then katie brings us the check once again i m astonished by her words she brought my change picked up her shovel dug deeper and said look i don t know what you guys are trying to do but management here really loves me here so i don t know what you re trying to do or why but whatever it is it s not going to work i replied it s not like we re out to get you or anything wow wow just wow i am happy to pass this torch to my girlfriend who was with me on both occasions and has more than enough credibility to speak for our experiences i m a glass half full kind of guy i kept telling her to relax calm down and take the high road i still hope they call her redeem this place otherwise badger cafe your delicious food and other servers will be sorely missed girlfriend is currently writing her own review and email through their website when i tipped because i still just could not bring myself to stiff an entire place on the tip i wrote on one of the bills because the guy with the bum legs deserves it with a packed bar she even thought she had the time to take out her tablet argue with us constantly and provide no service other than bringing the check this should be a massive red flag the gentleman brought out menus food drinks refills etc i m honestly baffled what did the managers owners tell her to make her feel so invincible to customer complaints what do they think she is doing do they really support this kind of behavior
  retro 80 dive that serves huge plates great food and friendly service the menu is big and they have alot the chicken is done to perfection and they are the king of the fries on the block if you got to decide between the 4 other places in the area new system wins hands down
  opening night at big earl s they were busy right at opening looks like old town needed a bbq joint i know there s much debate about what constitutes real bbq imho there are many real bbqs a wide range of cooking styles rubs sauces textures flavors etc the point being no one bbq can hope to please everybody with that in mind big earl s has a definite style 1 all the sauces are slightly spicy there are no sweet or tangy sauces here indeed the ghost chile sauce is awesome hot 2 all the sauces are smoky if you don t like your bbq to be slightly metallic i e like an iron skillet this won t work for you that said i encourage you to give big earl s a try and decide for yourself the staff was friendly and knowledgeable better than i expected for an opening night prompt drink refills in a nice canning jar glass i m a little annoyed with the guy who kept stealing my dirty napkins they could have absorbed a little more sauce apps just me tonight so i only sampled two the fried pickles and the big earl s challenge wings the pickles were indescribably awesome i couldn t stop eating them seemed to taste both dill and slightly sweet like a cinnamon sugar and wonderfully crunchy in their light breading batter the wings were covered in the big earl s ghost chile sauce good hot the heat doesn t grab you right up front but builds to a nice burn after a few wings oddly the sauce seemed to make the skin on the wings slippery so watch out for flying wings the brisket was awesome sure to be a tough competitor in this year s brisket throw down the pulled pork was tender and juicy can t wait to try it in a sandwich the pork ribs were a little dry for me but nothing a little extra sauce didn t cure i had sides of mac n cheese and homemade fries both worth having again although you need to eat the mac n cheese first because it cools quickly and loses some of its creamy goodness i ordered a banana pudding for desert which i took home to share with my wife i have no idea how it tastes because she didn t share
  friendly greetings ok atmosphere good singer not sure what language maybe thai but nice vocal and music great food i m quite picky and have tried a lot of thai restaurants this one stands out as one of my favorite the beef noodle soup has a great soup base hot spicy little sour great for winter time spicy mint leave stir fried with ground pork is much better cooked compare to most la thai restaurant great service we got there 15min before 15 discount buy1 get1 free singha beer promotion which starts 10pm but the server instead of having us wait outside figured out a way and took care of us nice well definitely be back and next time with more friends to share the good stuff
  if you ve eaten at the henderson location dont eat at this one so disappointed yeah it looks the same but it doesn t taste the same
  we might be the first couple ever to go from a blowout night at joel robuchon to the next night at binion s we loved it two manhattans apiece and all the nostalgia and cow we could handle in one night was a true bargain the setting overlooking the strip from atop binion s downtown is fantastic use the glass elevator to get there the restaurant with dark wood paneling and lots of burgundy accents conjures up a steakhouse atmosphere that i didn t think existed anymore but this is no working theme park the kitchen knows what it s doing for the most part service is friendly efficient and professional the food exceeded admittedly low expectations my husband got the escargot to start and they were well made in a very traditional garlic herb butter the salads were nice of course being a steakhouse beef is the star here and binion s delivered my extra rare filet was perfectly cooked and richly flavorful while my husband s rare ribeye was nicely seared and very tasty it wasn t the very best steaks we ve had but it was very good indeed the beef had that nice depth that western beef seems to have the only quibble with the meat is that it was underseasoned we needed both the salt and pepper shakers on the table the sides were a bit pedestrian my husband s loaded baked potato was particularly clumsy but the vegetables were cooked properly this is the place where time stood still and we re grateful for that it s a taste of old vegas
  the happy hour is awesome mango mai tai s are excellent i also really like the beef omurice the happy hour sushi rolls are all great tasting i always get the las vegas roll
  i live in the san francisco bay area but my company has an office in the university area of charlotte and i often have to take colleagues to dinner nine times out of ten i ll pick this place because 1 it s fun 2 it s reasonably priced 3 it s delicious and 4 it s fun i love sushi but i don t usually get it here because i m all about the hibachi table your party is seated at the table and the waitress and assistant take your drink and food orders i always get the steak and shrimp combination and soon afterwards you have a salad and soup in front of you a hibachi chef admittedly of varying talents arrives with a cart of food and he confirms your orders most of the hibachi chefs are pretty good they twirl the spatula a bit serve the sauce cut up some shrimp and set the table on fire in an onion ring chimney pretty fun the good chefs can do some pretty cool things with eggs and shrimp tails you wonder how they keep their fingers considering how quickly they throw their knives around but last time i checked they all had 10 fingers then they start cooking the food en masse and i m always impressed with how quickly they serve an entire table of 14 within 20 minutes next thing you know the chef scrapes the table cleans it and bids you good night the food is usually excellent they have perfect seafood and ginger sauces to complement the natural flavors and they keep your drinks water glasses full great food great time and a reasonable price hence 5 stars
  so after hearing and reading so much about the slider truck we decided to give it a try my first slider truck experience was a secret location on n lake dr we were fortunate enough to get just on time with the truck when the line wasn t long seeing as i am so indecisive about everything i figured it was just a good idea to order one of everything it was a good idea the result was little container full of different flavored sliders which had me salivating they were so good i was tempted to lick the styrofoam container that had some jalapeno jelly on it luckily there was still a little bun left to sop up all that juicy goodness now a few words on service i love friendly service and these people make you feel right at home from greeting to pickup the smiles don t stop how does it feel to love your job the way these guys look at work it seems they have the answer to that question my second slider truck experience was the very next day in the back parking lot on flamingo got there in the evening an hour before they closed up and got a couple of pep peps yayas barbies and captain s orders great eats again and you get free candy it was an awesome and fun experience both times i can t wait for my next experience
  i love this place the wild west shrimp is the best ever it is the reason why i love coming here 10 0 appetizer wild west shrimp 8 0 entree bacon burger great and cooked well mouthwatering taste with fresh flavor 8 0 fries fresh and delicious
  wow i ve been going to yasu sushi since 2007 it used to be a fine establishment with great sushi the past two times however i have been horribly sick afterwards the sushi rolls are very loose and sloppy even though they take a long time to come out tonight there were 3 servers and 2 runners and yet it took 3 hours to complete our order i had set up a birthday reservation for 6 30 for 6 and we were the only reservation for the night i looked at the paper they had sat two other people on our table so much for reservations our server never refilled our drinks nor did he get addition drinks without us tracking him down a friend went to the manager that was too busy to listen over 200 in food and drinks and you re too busy yasu was a great place now they are simply just another sushi restaurant in a strip mall what a disappointment
  so i ate here last night as part of the madison fair share fundraiser dinner and my group was very excited we paid 50 for our tickets which included 3 courses each paired with a beer from one barrel brewing what could be better than a menu that is hand crafted from local ingredients that were grown and brewed around madison right well unfortunately for us it was a huge disappointment we had an appetizer that consisted of shredded cucumber a rich buttery sauce and nice pieces of bread very delicious and refreshing the first course was braised rabbit served on a bed of rps fettuccine with a creamy mushroom and beer sauce this was really delicious especially whatever crispy things they put on top the only complaint is that it was at best lukewarm when we received it the beer was very delicious an american pale ale the second course was where things went wrong strangely enough they served us salad after the main course it consisted of a pile of pickled vegetables including pickled morel mushrooms rhubarb radish and asparagus it was served on a bed of greens with an ipa vinaigrette now i was very excited about this dish at first i love pickled stuff i thought the idea of pickled morels was very exciting and interesting unfortunately everything about the dish was absolutely overwhelming and rather cringe worthy the vinaigrette mixed with the pickling brine made our eyes water the anise was confusing and disgusting admittedly this may be a personal preference but we all disliked it and the greens were overshadowed by all of this i wish this had been a served before the main dish b had fewer pickles or a less intense vinaigrette and c had more greens to even it all out the beer with this one was also a loser for us but we don t like ipa so that is hard to gauge the third and final course was a dessert consisting of a strawberry and rhubarb sauce a key lime curd and a rather odd white puffy thing resembling a cham tort none of us finished it it was insanely sweet the white puffy thing was kind of gross and it was just not satisfying the beer served with this was really rather ghastly as well it was a wheat beer and it seriously tasted like cigarette ash we each managed to take 2 or 3 sips to try and figure out what it was we were tasting but after that couldn t take another drink i would rather drink budweiser or old milwaukee which is just about the worst insult i can give to a beer final comments i had a really delicious old fashioned brandy sweet and the service was really great the wait staff were really on top of things and the owner was out there busting his butt too i will consider going back for their regular food some day i just hope this poorly executed menu was a fluke rather than the norm in the end it helped support a group i think is doing really great things and i am happy i did it i just wish it had been a little better
  favorite korean market they have everything the building is very clean organized and not crowded at all despite their large variety of products the yummy tteok and bakery kiosks are particularly why i make the trip over always worth a stop on the way in or out the lovely women who work at these kiosks are always delightful and value their customers i will return many times in the future and i would recommend this market to anyone
  wonderful happy hour specials but can quickly get busy if you have the patience to wait for fora table or a seat at the bar the food will not disappoint
  i have come here a bunch of times and decided it is time to write a review i have tried many things on the menu including the falafel shawarma gyro and chicken kebob and they were all great literally the best chicken shawarma i have every had in my entire life including the when i was in the middle east the gyro is also really good i always sub salad for tabouleh because the salad dressing is amazing i must come here once a week for a chicken shawarma plate with rice hummus and salad highly recommended
  i ordered the mexican burger combo after asking the cashier what was in the burger pepper jack cheese american cheese grilled onions and grilled green chiles i asked to have fried zucchini instead of french fries with my combo she said yes but didn t tell me she was charging me 60 extra my burger arrived with no green chiles the cashier took my burger back and had the cook put grilled chiles on my burger it came back with one piece of chile covering half of the burger i then noticed there was no pepper jack cheese on my burger the zucchini was from frozen and not fresh but tasted okay a positive note they serve coca cola
  bad bad bad i realize they haven t been open very long but come on i got there at 12 20 pm the line to order was moving slow so i decided to try to place an order online online indicated that my order pad thai with shrimp would be ready at 12 43 i finally got to the cashier and paid and waited and waited finally after observing several frustrated customers i received my order at 1 05 once back at my desk to eat and the omitted the shrimp that i paid for the noodles had no sauce at all on them i called the restaurant only to be put on hold for 10 minutes i ve hung up and crossed this restaurant off my list
  decided to eat here today for lunch today with some friends that are locals the salad bar was very diverse but a lot of the sides had strange flavors that did not blend well with the meats no soups either the meat was delicious the selection was very good as well their website lists the choices pretty accurately the meat wasn t over flavored either all in all a good place to eat but the sides need work
  their food is on point asasa fries are a must not to mention great customer service
  love this place the sushi is fantastic atmosphere is great and the service gets the job done definitely worth visiting
  best turkish grilled sandwiches in town amazing food for a cheep price very tasty and delicious be careful it is very addictive
  i typed japanese and my zip code in to yelp and came up with korean so off i went i am pretty sure there are several menu options i had a lunch menu which had none of the grill options on it and i think there is yet another menu for the sushi bar directly behind me i could hear a grill being used and saw a couple of carts of food go past me to the table would have been nice to see how all the food was used but i probably would have watched closely enough to intrude on their meal i ordered a sliced beef lunch box 8 95 and an iced tea 1 25 first up was a cloudy bowl of soup with green onions in it pretty tasty after a while lunch arrived in a compartmented tray front and center was the beef several gristly pieces off to the near left were some pickled veggies and in the far left were i think 3 slices of california roll a piece of apple some sort of deep fried thingy and some ginger in the far right was sticky rice and in the very center was some wasabi and in the near right was i think a couple of different kinds of bean sprouts some sort of green leafy veggie and some sort of cake thing even though i couldn t identify most of it i ate it all obviously it didn t taste bad or i would have ignored some of it the service was ok but not friendly like it was with the regulars i would have liked to ask some questions about what was on my plate but got the big box store lack of eye contact with every employee that walked past oddly when they brought my entree they did not take away my empty soup bowl i noticed they did that at all of the tables only busing once it looks like the back section of the dining room could be partially closed off for a group it was an ok experience i think i would rather go with somebody who knew the foods better
  both of our breakfast meals were delicious and unique best place for breakfast in vegas portions are for 2 3 people if you wanted to share definitely worth any wait you can put your name in then go have a drink or play a few hands of poker downstairs
  prices are a little steep however love the fresh made daily fruit bowls and salads cinnamon buns are to die for and bakery products the best of any chain i ve ever been too plus they have products you can t find anywhere else in southern nevada the store reminds me of a cross between sprouts and traders joe s and is only going to get better imo
  have been going here for years but recently they changed a few menu items and policies they no longer offer kids options for food so your forced to purchase a 26 dollar meal for a child they also charge you extra for substituting a veg instead of mashed potatoes they feel mashed potatoes are a garnish for the steak or fish bandera your in the hospitality business i won t be back what a shame
  we were staying at club 36 next door and ordered pizza it tasted like grocery store frozen not wood fired and was pricey staff was pretty rude to boot pass on it
  i met my favorite jaime w here for breakfast on a sunday morning weiss had been on my radar for a while so when she suggested we meet there i was excited to finally see if it lived up to the hype i ordered a pretty basic breakfast that came with eggs potatoes and bacon and we also decided to share an everything bagel i have had some good bagels in my day when i first started dating my husband he worked for a man that had relocated his bagel shop from new york city to arizona and i ate man many bagels from that shop the everything bagel we had at weiss was without a doubt the best bagel i have had in vegas my only real complaint about weiss was the service it super spotty i asked for more half and half for my coffee our waitress came back 5 minutes later to see how we were doing empty handed so i asked again despite the so so service the food was fantastic great breakfast potatoes and the bacon was cooked perfectly and that bagel so good weiss has definitely lived up to the hype thus far next time i will be sure to go for lunch so i can try the soup i have heard such wonderful things about
  it doesn t take much to please me but these guys go above and beyond in their service not only is their food delicious but their staff is incredibly helpful and peppy at all times for service like this i will continue to come back and work my way through their menu
  yummy breakfast was delicious lunches were solid
  ok place with big portions the wait staff is crap must be the management teaching them how to be crappy or trying to make more of a buck the food comes in high quantity but not quality i can do without the mashed potatoes biscuits and iceberg lettuce my cobb salad was kinda smallish no butter for the biscuits no sweet n low i ve been to the original in san diego and it was really good there something must be up with management or something here we ate here twice but will look elsewhere in the hotel we were warned of a wait at certain times
  best food on the strip
  i was raised in the south and love bbq i would classify big earl s as georgia texas bbq fusion the collard greens and vinegar slaw were outstanding the cornbread was a little too tex mex for me i had the pork ribs and beef brisket both had good flavor i would have given a higher rating but the meat was a little dry for my taste and the price was too high especially for lunch
  absolutely the most god awful horrid food i have ever tasted wife ordered the egg plant parmesan came with an inch on stinky cheese after digging into it came across a small piece of eggplant had to send it back only to receive it with more s cheese ugh ordered the veal picatta it was undercooked the pasta with it was awful and swimming in tomato sauce upon exiting i looked into the kitchen found a bunch of cooks with dirty t shirts they were not wearing any hair hats and it was not sanitary i also saw many empty large tomato cans come on the prices charged at this restaurant are worth a kings ransom and they can t afford to serve fresh tomatoes the waiter kept addressing everyone dear this dear that hey go easy guy you are just a waiter and not my long lost relative absolutely the worst itlain restaurant that i have ever been to stay away from this place
  went here for my birthday dinner and had a great time contrary to my belief that restaurants like this have no decent food the food was absolutely delicious we had the kung pao chicken the pad thai the sea bass the steak rice and much more our entire group enjoyed every bite they also brought me birthday ice cream as a nice surprise the only small inconvenience we experienced was that even with reservations we still had to wait thankfully the waiting area lounge was very nice w couches tables a nice bar and good music so in reality i have no complaints about this restaurant
  was here during last year labor day weekend the place is dead a few small party amongst us dinner was ok but service suck big time either it s getting late or the people there are just rude as hell sorry for the fuss but this place deserve 0 star if possible for what they did because of rude services we did not think they deserve any tip ate and paid the bill with a credit card left and have fun in vegas as usual a few weeks later my friend saw her credit card statement with a charge from alan albert s that was more than what was shown on the her bill receipt alan albert s had charged extra on her card she called the credit card company fax them the bill always good to save your bill receipt and the credit card company disputed with the restaurant credit card company was able to get back the extra amount that they have charged what kind of service was that if she didn t check her credit card statement they could have gotten away with extra for being rude
  i was pleasantly surprised to find there is a q shack in charlotte since it was always one of my favorite places in durham after this visit i ll probably go back since it s got lots of nostalgia for me and is close to work but seriously 3 hushpuppies three one two three not four one less three definitely not five more like three and while we re on the topic of me stuffing my face with way more atherosclerotic foods than i should the brisket portion was a little skimpy someone should go visit the original location and take notes eating at this place was like q shack that was left in the dryer too long
  i love their happy hour and their sushi i ve never had a bad roll and always leave satisfied try the sunshine roll on a hot day their sauces are sooooo yummy the staff is pretty good too
  baboy wanted to come here he says it s his fave spot and i had never been here before we had their famous bread and butter french onion soup and salad he ordered some kind of steak and i got the prime rib and scallops i ordered the prime rib medium rare our server had to check to make sure they could still do that temp since it was late in the evening they could it came out perfectly cooked and delicious i am obsessed with scallops as well and they were fantastic hunnie bunnie had grilled cheese accompanied by some giant broccoli great side instead of french fries everything was great
  the food is ok about the same as any other five guys this location is one of the few dining spots open late night in uptown so enter at your own risk after standard dinner time i ve been here late at night and there was a cop inside standing watch made me uneasy and of course a majority of customers after a certain hour have been over served at a nearby bar could be good people watching or could be dangerously close to a drunken brawl like i said dine at your own risk
  the most important thing to note is that this place shares a kitchen with the good italian restaurant uncle sals we happened to find this place when i was going to office max in the same complex we stepped in to check it out as the signs outside advertised a large selection of beer and wine to go while we were not overly impressed with the amount of beer and wine to go about 20 varieties of imported 6 packs and about 20 wines we were impressed with the menu i really like uncle sals so i knew the food would be good and it was right up the alley of my picky fiance we went here for valentines day as we figured it would not be too packed we were right they offer some nice wines by the glass and imported beers at a very reasonable price the menu consists of burgers sandwiches hot dogs vienna beef pizza calzones and some sides the dessert menu is limited to blue bunny ice cream there is a small bar at the rear and about 10 tables it is very small and has a nice vibe we both ordered personal pizzas and they were very good the service was attentive and the food came promptly even though uncle sals next door was packed i have only been here once to eat but the first impression was very good i wish they would add a couple of salads to the menu as in the summer that is often all i am in the mood for i think they need to tweak the menu a bit and i d like to try it again before i really commit but for now it is four stars i plan on going back soon even just to have some peroni on tap
  wow what a find we just went vegan a month ago and this place was a phenomenal find it gave my husband the will to survive vegan junkfood everything you can imagine in vegan format there s no deprivation in sight here we had the mongolian bowl vegan chilli cheese fries texas poboy bbq chicken sandwich and mint choc chip tsoynami for dessert amazing food tasted like the real thing only this is the real thing real food wow
  we have tried many indian restaurants in the phoenix area and we both agreed this was by far the best i had the butter chicken and saag paneer and paneer naan everything was served very hot and fresh and was just delicious i can t wait to go back and try their buffet and was happy to hear it is also served on the weekends our waitress was very friendly and the manager came over to make sure we were happy with our meal as well will definitely be back
  best chaat and veg indian food in phoenix for really low prices the ordering system is a little weird you fill out a form and bring it into the kitchen but you can order over the phone and the food will be ready for you i would give them 5 stars but its a messy store and they don t have any meat options for carnivores like me be sure to try their desserts as well i recommend bringing an indian friend along to help with ordering
  thanks tien food was great and so was the service will come back again weather is perfect for outdoor eats
  when hungry for alittle something in terminal 4 stop and try the mac and cheese yum yum they offer it with ham i had that served on the side delish my compliments to the chef
  mom and i popped in for a quick snack got two mini burros green chicken and machaca beef excellent the green chicken had a very nice kick to it the machaca was tender and lean absolutely delicious will definitely be back
  la bocca has great food and wine no doubt the bocca trio pizza is delish and the red sangria is a must order i ve been happy with all the pizzas i ve ordered the garlic and margarita are good and if you like mushrooms you have to get the mushroom pizza there are some misses though the bruschetta boards can be hit or miss and the pasta dishes lack seasoning also really wish the restaurant had ranch for all those crusts on the pizza would be amazing be warned you need to call ahead if there will be a wait i was told last night by the hostesses that the reason i was watching parties be sat in front of my party was because they are required to seat parties who call ahead in front of the people on the waiting list a pretty wacky rule for a restaurant that won t take reservations and pretty frustrating for a hungry group of out of towners i was hosting who had to wait an hour to be sat when we were told 30 min i would suggest a re thought around that lame policy and maybe suggest management be a little more liberal with the air conditioning in the middle of the summer it s hot in that place when it s full all in all it is a good restaurant though and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal on mill
  absolutely loved it we had breakfast and here s what you should know come hungry the portions are huge i suggest you share especially the omelets they use 5 eggs in them we shared 2 omelets and a side of grits between 3 people and still had left overs our server chester was excellent and had very good suggestions
  i was so excited to go here that my expectations went a bit too high i think an actually requirement of working here is to be from brazil i wonder how that exactly works out all the meat that we tried was really delicious however a lot of the times it was extremely rare i like my meat a bit more cooked and when i asked for medium it was like they suddenly avoided our table the buffet didn t match the cost of the meal for that price they should be bringing all the food to me over all i dont think i would go back
  the food is cheap and very healthy the customer service is great the congee is just 2 and filing
  good taste good portions i ordered the chicken artichoke calzone ate half more than enough for lunch and took other half home 10 well spent
  i love smashburger i really do i was craving a juicy and delicious burger there was no question where we were going we just happened to be on this side of town and stopped into this location i really liked it they have a great outdoor seating area the inside seems a little smaller than the unlv location staff was very friendly and service was quick if we re on this side of town and in the mood for a burger i m sure we d stop in here again
  been here before so many time s but every time i write a review it get erased so like always great food and great service today was super busy but still superb service keep the great work
  great for vegetarians and meat lovers yummy muffins were a highlight we were a group of 5 and had to wait a bit but that was okay as we were seated within 10 15 minutes of arrival everything was made from scratch the stuffed french toast is a must
  the service was excellent starting from the phone call to make the reservation the food was excellent everything was delicious including the service i recommend theshrimp and avocado salad
  my wife really enjoyed their italian margarita s and i had the en feugo hot sauce on my burrito and my forehead was on fire we were pleasantly surprised by this strip mall located restaurant and would definitely go back
  gordon biersch i love you so much i m sorry i ever strayed from your happy hour
  what an interesting place we stopped here for lunch on our way out to red rocks park excuse my surprise as i m not from vegas but it was interesting to see gaming here this is a pretty good restaurant with some interesting tapas we decided to just be surprised and let the waitstaff bring us whatever i think the arepas were the highlight the bacon wrapped dates were interesting but perhaps a little weird to eat hot dates
  this place is very close to my home my husband i just had dinner here it was so good the spagetti meatbslls is very yummy nice trendy atmosphere amazing staff customer service very hoping neighborhood place we will definitely be coming here again
  my parents were visiting from la and out of all restaurants i chose ichiza big mistake wow i am in shock with the service we got tonight i ve been here about 3 times and never had a problem until tonight the moment we walked in the waitress sat us by the door and my parents didn t want to sit there because they were cold so we asked to sit somewhere else she would not move us even though half the restaurant was empty it was confusing and did not make sense then we continued to order and there were two specific problems we encountered 1 we ordered garlic bok choy granted i never ordered this before but for 4 95 you literally got 3 bites of bok choy i can honestly say it was one stem that was broken up into the individual pieces it blew my mind i almost thought it was a joke yes everything is small there but this was beyond a small portion it was miniature i thought no way how can this be then i ordered 2 tuna sashimi salads and asked for the dressing on the side she brought one small bowl half filled with ponzu sauce which is the dressing used for the salad then she brought one small bowl filled with sesame oil ok no thanks i dont want to pour oil right onto my dressing i asked for one more bowl of ponzu sauce and she made the biggest deal out of it sending it back and talking to everyone about it like i was a crazy and asking for something out of the ordinary i m sorry but for two salads i don t think its that difficult to bring two bowls of dressing on the side and do it with a smile i order dressing on the side everywhere and they acted like i was an alien for asking for it this way so she brings back literally 1 tablespoon of ponzu in a big bowl wow i was so humiliated and embarassed that i took my parents here telling them it s a really good place they know they can always trust my food taste and i was blown away by the waitress now i don t want to judge a place simply by one waitress but both waitresses were this way and the guy in the back who shook his head when she brought back the oil to ask him what it was i guess she didn t know what sesame oil looks like even though she works there and should know the menu poor service again if a customer asks for more dressing bring it we paid 60 for our food that s the least you can do also the waitresses never came by to refill water or ask if everything is ok not even once i guess she was pissed off about the dressing incident now i don t want to sound like one of those annoying people that one thing wrong and i change my mind about a restaurant but if i am going to bring out of town visitors here and i am a loyal customer i think i deserve some decent service i will never come back and never tell others to come here also i am not missing out on anything the food is really ok not bad but i ve had way better elsewhere ichiza we are broken up forever
  nakamura ya boasts a wide variety of italian japanese fusion dishes some like the kobe beef carpaccio more italian style are more recognizable while others like the uni tomato cream spaghetti have an unusual combination of flavors there s a really good deal to be found in their prix fixe menu but it s limited to certain dishes if you wish to venture outside prix fixe standouts for me were the green mussels escargot style and the kurobota sausage kinoko mushroom cream risotto there s also a large blackboard of number ranked specials on their wall i suggest making a game of it and going down the list during your many visits to the restaurant yes visits you will be coming back and you will probably have a different favorite dish every time
  service good food ok and prices reasonable on of the cheaper breakfast options in lv
  love echo and rig this is our go to place for a nice relaxing dinner or a weekend brunch we have been for every meal including happy hour the upstairs features an indoor dining room as well as a large balcony area with plenty of seating and heaters when it s cool the staff is so friendly and helpful and always going above and beyond for the guests we have gone to echo and rig with kids before but it s not really a restaurant that is too kid friendly the atmosphere is laid back and quiet and kids usually get bored pretty quickly with no tvs to distract them or other activities going on echo and rig is a great steakhouse for a date night or a family brunch
  the chicken kabob with rice is very tasty ask for a side of taziki sauce on the side
  before our vegas trip i had bookmarked hash house a go go but i was a little afraid of their giant portions since the daily egg was right near where we were staying we came here instead thanks to yelp i knew they had some mediterranean options along with lots of good ol american breakfast items i ordered the gyro omelet breakfast dishes come with two sides so i went with hash browns and fruit yeah i was trying to be a little healthy the omelet was delicious but so big i couldn t finish it my husband tried the oatmeal pancakes and my daughter had the plain buttermilk pancakes these might have been the tastiest pancakes i ve ever tried i don t know what they put in them but they are definitely doing something right unfortunately the portions were so large the two of them could have split a single order and been completely satisfied service was a tad slow and not particularly friendly but the great food made up for that on our visit the lone tv was tuned to fox news which made it a little hard to digest my food still everything was great so if i m ever in the area again i ll be back
  great little place the outside looks a bit naff and cheap tbh but the inside has comfy seats cool art on the walls and the food is both interesting good value for money and most importantly tasty the staff are not too bad either
  pretty good pizza here even though i ve been loyal to ray s down the driveway maybe i like ray s cheese better this place does a nice crust dough though sauce is good too i like fran s favorite which has mushrooms and fresh roma tomatoes everything here does taste very fresh the house salad is way better than most other places as they use romaine i think lettuce as opposed to non nutritional iceberg fresh tasting and i appreciate the fact that i ordered it drizzled very lightly w balsamic dressing and they brought it out w just the right amount lunch specials are a great deal
  i love love love this place its kind of an epic journey from midtown with all the construction going on downtown right now but on those rare days that i can justify a 90 minute lunch this is in the top five fancy sandwiches and salads sinful desserts and an art gallery
  weak drinks emphasis on the weak and rude staff will not return their bitchy bartenders even yelled at my friend as we were walking out because he had told them the drinks were weak really no class at this place
  authentic hawaiian plate lunch down to the macaroni salad all meats were delicious will definitely add this to my regular stops when in the area
  i never eat at the same restaurant on vacation but i did it i did it all for todd english now the place isn t cheap but it s convienietly located in the bellagio so you can gamble eat here then go to a show or go back to gambling it s a dimly lit restaurant with dark decor and very proper nicely dressed servers we ended up getting 2 appetizers to share instead of getting an entree each the special of the day was a sausage flatbread it was so delicious the spicy sausage and the gooey cheese on top of the buttery crispy flatbread made me drool it was so good that i went back the next day just to have it again we also got the kabobs the chicken and the beef were both tender and so well seasoned i hate biting into beef and having to gnaw my way through the thing but this was cooked perfectly the next night we got the the carpet baggers also delicious fried oysters on top of truffled mashed potatoes we licked those oyster shells clean i am still thinking about those to this day not only were our appetizers quickly brought out but the bread basket they give you to start with is dangerous the rolls in the basket are varied so you wanna try each one rosemary loaf white chocolate bread and crispy bread to dip into their complimentary olive spread if you are looking for a quick place to dine make it olives i m a stuck up foodie but i have to say this place was very impressive
  this is a really neat store to browse and if you re looking for a specialty ingredient you ll probably find it here however consider other options before you actually buy something it s almost definitely cheaper elsewhere if you don t feel like shopping around or stopping at multiple stores to get what you need just be aware that you re paying extra for the convenience of a one stop shop also check expiration dates i forgot to do so last time i shopped here and ended up with some lovely stale food i do like to stop here and buy a few things as an occasional indulgence but in general it s just too expensive their halva is fantastic though seriously the best
  only been here once had a small order so there should have not been any problems place is very clean and kept up crew was very nice
  ordered the number two with two eggs over easy home fries and sausage bacon brother ordered chicken salad sandwich on wheat with fries both menu items were delicious after a long flight in the place was packed on this late morning on saturday the waiter was very energetic and friendly checking up on us more than once especially about the coffee great place for a quick breakfast lunch at a very affordable price
  my parents just ate here and thought the food was great they had a signature burger and not your mama s grilled cheese and were raving ab out each
  when someone says i m in the mood for pizza usually people think of a whole in the wall quick piece of cardboard or half cooked soggy bottom want to be crust covered with cheese with beer and football am i right i ve got to tell you grimaldis exception to the old ways we think about one of our oldest and favorite family meal ideas they ve taken pizza from a feeding frenzy at sporting college hazing quick through something down the kids throat parties etc and made it a dining experience a 3 course wine tasting some place you can take your date or family without feeling like you re in the midst of a recession the quality of the food and professionally fun staff add to the experience do yourself a favour and see for yourselves
  i am addicted to chipotle there i said it i previously reviewed chipotle prior to truly understanding just how darn good this food is five stars i scream it from the top of the mountain folks that work here are always helpful and laid back friendly but very very efficient professional and awesome also check out the iphone app they have now so you can pre order exactly what you want awesome enjoy
  solid italian deli in phoenix not the best could use more variety and service and goods the best is bayside in santa monica ca but it s worthy addition to the italian deli pantheon i had the italian sandwich it was good not great
  was looking for a place to eat in the paris hotel in las vegas didn t really want italian but it smelt good from outside so glad we decided to go in we had salad chicken parmigiana and a cannoli with chocolate chips we shared this and had plenty of food it was so good it all tasted very fresh i don t like cannoli s but this was the best i ve ever tried the service was very good as well i totally recommend eating here
  aaahhhhh barrio queen so i ve heard wonderful things about barrio queen from fellow yelpers we were here for some cocktails last night it s in a terrific area trees were adorned with lights since i am a woman with the attention span of a fish ooohhh look at the lights okay i m back we sat in the patio and i really enjoyed it my man friend is smittened by their limon y coco this is a margarita made with coconut infused tequila it was okay i m not a fan to make it a little authentic there were like grinded up coconut pieces which made it gritty no thanks i ordered the paloma which was a grapefruit lemon lime and mexican squirt yes we went to town with the jokes omg this was so terribly tart and tangy i put two packs of raw sugar in it and i ended up leaving 3 4 of the drink what a waste of 11 we did order the original and chocolate flan the chocolate was way too decadent i prefer the original
  awesome banh mi they also make great bubble tea which is hard to find good or otherwise in the area
  we landed here on new year s day when they were serving a buffet food was fairly good but service was very confused and disorganized staff seemed to be all foreign students who didn t really know what was going on i d give it a second try when it isn t a holiday to see if it runs more smoothly
  i love this place it s a must whenever i m in town and try to go on a monday the bartender is awesome just remember to kcco oh and try the chili dog
  still has to be my favorite place to eat wish they were closer but we ll worth the drive it s kinda cool how they remember how i like my coffee so much
  came in to try the 9 99 special they re advertising i had the steak which was a little bit more the steak was tuff i think shoe leather tastes way better and i have never eaten shoe leather i must say the management staff was on point after telling them how the food tastes they discounted my meal which was ok but still i can t get the bad taste out of my mouth oh btw the root beer was the best thing going
  it is by far not a true delicatessen but more of an upscale sandwich shop with some soups the corned beef has little flavor because it s so lean they do not make any of there breads soups are average at best hot foods are acceptable there supposed boiled potatoes are right out of a can chili is below average and all there deserts are not made in house if you want to experience a real deli in the phoenix scottsdale area head to chompie s
  i had a cod hero and my friend had a burger both prepared perfectly i had the lettuce wedge which came with a very tasty light oil dressing the potato side was also excellent first day open and the staff was ready well trained friendly and attentive and in the middle of our meal in walks mario batali outstanding meal and a highly recommended restaurant located inside venetian las vegas near the sports book just off the main casino floor
  what a creative concept great atmosphere russian kgb let me recommend the sliders and the malts life s sinful pleasures time to hit the gym
  excelente tacos and beans their beans are seriously way delicious order a big order to go home so you can upgrade your lifestyle a little bit tortillas are super fresh too like you wish your nana had dozens of these on deck you wish
  went for the thursday night all you can eat buffet we were seated with a small wait the staff was attentive and we had a great meal this is our clubhouse and we are making an effort to regularly eat there so far every meal was well prepared the service was good and we saw many of our friends and neighbors eating there too give it a try if you have not and don t listen to the local gossip that was a long time ago before present management took the helm good quality and great prices support your clubhouse
  i go here every week with my husband and a group of friends i ve noticed there are some negative reviews on here and that came as a big surprise to me my husband and i have had indian food in many different states and even different countries around the world after traveling around the world to find the perfect curry i can tell you that this is the best i have not had better indian food truly
  carmon s bistro is a rare find in downtown champaign almost everything on the menu is unique and delicious along with a bazillion wine choices i keep going back just to try new things so nice to have an option that isn t your usual chain frozen food local and fresh too so you can feel good about what you re eating when you go if they happen to have chocolate pudding while this sounds silly order it it taste like nothing you have ever had and it s amazing and don t forget to check out their pop up dinner s on monday nights different theme each week
  been there twice and the food was great we had the 8 course price fix menu and there was so much food i couldn t barely finish the last 2 course but it was to die for the first time i was here for my bday we tried the lobster dish it was all i could remember because it was sooo good
  had the italian beef it sucked over priced
  great place for brunch buffet highly recommended it great food service and variety
  oh man do i love this place their food is so good and so are their prices the first time i went i had never had afghan food and was curious about what it was it was normal foods i had heard of but with spices that are simply wonderful if it s your first time i highly recommend the lunch buffet that way you can taste a little of everything they offer because deciding on a dinner item was difficult i wanted to try so many of them i came back last dec with a few girlfriends and we ended up chatting and eating well past when all the other patrons left oops the owner was so kind and told us to stay as long as we wanted he chatted with us as well telling us about his family and moving the restaurant from san fran to tempe etc i really cannot say enough great things about this place just go eat there
  definitely not my scene i ve been wanting to go here for a while and finally went last night with my boyfriend what a tourist trap do not go if you do not like sitting at a table with strangers that s how they seat everyone there i could barely hear myself talk because it was so loud with the live band and spankings they also have an alphorn that they play at every table to get you to tip them no kidding they will set the horn on top of your table and play the same tune at every table in the restaurant to get tipped it gets very old very fast if that s not enough they also go around asking if you want your picture taken which they try to make you buy at the end of your meal the food was meh my pretzel was hard and the potato dumplings weren t great the only reason why this review has two stars rather than one is because of their sausage and apple strudel the strudel was actually really good other than that i don t have any interest in returning
  my wife and i live in the south end neighborhood and are going to visit the liberty often they have a fantastic bar and some great food we initially went to sample charlotte s best burger i vow to update this review but based on this visit it s a 3 star the burger was a great burger but was honestly far from the best i still would stand by the charlotte classics at diamond meullers even newer spots like jack beagle s in noda a big beefy messy burger doesn t always equate to a great burger we will definitely return though and will update with new finds update i have been back twice now and i have to switch to a 4 star the quality is just so good that i can t help it i had the pub burger again and it was great but still not the greatest in my opinion i have since had their poutine fries more pretzels and tried the caramel salted boudine and all was fantastic the fries were incredible because the gravy was not heavy yet extremely flavorful and the cheese was great quality and was nice and gooey through the whole dish the fries didn t get soggy in the dish either highly recommend it on the menu it sounds quite unhealthy but it s just fancy cheese fries and it s a must try will agree with the crowd that the service is a little bit lacking
  loved this place i am from out of town here for our son s graduation from uw madison grad school and as a native of new mexico and a student of mexican food throughout the us i can enthusiastically recommend pascual s nothing fancy but good nonetheless this is a fast food place think qdoba or the like but service price and food are all well above average very busy tonight by the way which seems in opposition to the so so yelp ratings try it
  awesome pizza crunchy edges lots of toppings fast delivery best pizza i ve had in a long time and i m laughing at people saying overpriced keep eating dominos and save the good stuff for the people who know what good pizza is
  hands down the best exceptional service from the host to bartender to the server best experience each time i dine
  stopped in on a sunday morning after reading the other reviews on yelp i was not disappointed as a vegetarian i had kay s special which was delicious and our waitress karla was delightful
  my husband looooves this place it s a little out of the way and totally hidden in a corner but worth finding the ingredients are fresh and the sauces are yummy the restaurant itself is literally a hole in the wall teeeny tiny w minimal seating but it always looks clean we ve never eaten inside idk y we ve always just ordered for pick up and ate at home let s get to the food my husbands usual the filet mignon sides fried rice gyoza salad the filet mignon is so tender and juicy obviously i m prone to just jump on his plate and take what i want if you are a steak lover this is a good choice my order wild alaskan salmon sides brown rice and grilled veggies more health conscious obviously i love the salmon it doesn t taste frozen and it s cooked just right the sauces they offer a bunch of different sauces to dip your meat chicken or seafood in my favorite is the terriyaki and sweet garlic make sure you have a mint or gum on hand over all we frequent this place a lot we like it it s quick and it s good ps it s closed 1 day not sure which sunday
  fantastic food great service good prices i am a foodiei try 20 places before i write a review trust me do urself a favour and eat at this place
  my food was cold we had to ask for chips my husband had to ask for the tortillas that were supposed to come with his food and when he finally got them his food was cold expensive and disappointing
  a friday afternoon of lounging in the beer garden at haus murphy s definitely tops my list of favorite things to do start with a glass of weizen a tall one then cruise through their extensive menu of bavarian specialties schnitzel or brats with a side of kraut black forest ham sandwich oriental chicken salad perhaps a strudel for dessert i opted for the reuben sandwich on my last visit though quite tasty the corned beef was sliced a bit too thick for my taste the deli down the street has them beat hands down stick with the sausage
  this is a small place that clearly show the love of the owners i found it to be spotlessly clean despite having older furnishing and decor and the food is made one order at a time that means it s a dollar or two more than the chain places like shlotskys and subway that re on the other side of thomas road but the quality of the ingredients is like 200 better next time i need a fix of good greek eastern mediteranean food i will be back for sure their tzatziki is just perfect cooling yet hot at the same time from generous amounts of garlic they do commercial catering too so if you re looking for a office lunch that s different definitely give them a try and don t forget cash only means no debit cards btw that s a shout out for the dude who came in behind me who said what not even debit cards
  so much variety we went at 7 am on a saturday and surprisingly we were able to enjoy breakfast and lunch lots to choose from however i didn t see many desserts
  tasty selection of sandwiches served by personable friendly folks that have great personalities and obviously care about their food and customers only thing that would have improved my meal was a pepper shaker to flavor up my sandwich
  combo pan roast ftw favorite place to eat in las vegas hands down
  came for an army retirement thing and tried some food wasn t too appealing to me so i just stuck with the beer not a lot of great choices on beer either
  ordered six tacos to go and it took 30 minutes got the tacos and they were cold i took them back and the bartender was rude and argumentative she said they would remake them and i said i didn t have any more time to wait she asked for a receipt which she didn t give in the first place the restaurant wasn t even busy this was my second time here it s unlikely that i ll go back
  most def a 5 star place they do know how to take care of people here
  they aren t messing around when it comes to hot sauce this stuff is the real deal
  horrible food horrible weak service a disgrace to the south side works
  i m addicted that s the summary a grass fed burgers automatic happy b shattered potato chips with awesome dip sauce stuff i could eat those all day c indoor outdoor seating d prompt service f never too busy we have not had a bad burger they are all delicious so says my husband i always order the cheeseburger the lemonade comes in a cup with finger imprints for the clumsy this is a plus it doesn t slip out of my hands the menu is short and sweet and may not appease or appeal to all but this girl who will jump at the sight of a grass fed burger cooked perfectly with delicious chips on the side is happy and there have been weeks where i ve found any excuse to get myself there for dinner multiple nights in one week
  wonderful spot i suggest everyone try it the service is attentive and friendly food is prepared fairly quick and includes a wide selection of great tasting vegetarian and vegan dishes it s a nice cozy cute spot for 1 4 people has takeout available also
  i went to this restaurant for my birthday this year it was alright to be honest i was expecting a little more for the money i did enjoy the fries they bring out when you first get there and the ambiance of the place is pretty cool but as far as the food goes nothing too special for the price good but not great
  we came here for lunch one day at work and we were all super excited to try the habanero burger the three of us who went all like spicy food while the burger itself was good spicy would be a loose description of it i would come back here but i would ask for the burger to be way spicier we will come back i am sure but hopefully the peppers will have some more kick
  love razoos amazing food and fun atmosphere definitely a place to eat if you want to have a fun dinner with family or friends
  3 5 stars would be my actual rating but i m giving 4 because the service was great with both manager and chef stopping to check on us and because the atmosphere was neighborhood cozy and convivial food we had the shortrib gorgonzola polenta and lamp lolly appetizers they were very good the polenta a tad sweet for me but hey it s cornmeal the lamb was served with lentils and cherries which sounds odd but worked nicely we both had the house salad with gorgonzola dressing and agreed it was delicious for our entree s dude had new york strip steak au poive and i had the crispy duck he liked his steak but not the gristle running along the side the potatoes and veggies were fresh and tasty my duck was okay a bit overdone but mainly suffered from soggy skin this has become my 1 restaurant pet peeve crispy skin ruined with saucing please stop did you know there are 500 types of martini s in the world me neither but there are and they all reside here elements has a 5 page martini menu with creative titles as a john hodgeman list of hobo names though not so funny still kind of silly kind of fun and half off during happy hour yea who is john hodgeman and what list of hobo names you ask in the name of niles butterball 80 on the list i beseech you to get thee to a bookstore now
  wow oh wow is what this place does to my tastebuds i stopped by here on a whim was not disappointed i had the avgolemono soup the great greek gyro feta fries omg the feta fries are ridiculous good everything was so fresh flavorful and amazingly delicious the restaurant is quite small but extremely clean service was a my husband i are now regulars
  we stopped in for a quick beer before our flight the bar features a large beer selection at pretty reasonable prices they were served in red solo cups which was a little odd but kind of fun at the same time we ordered from the counter as the bar was full the beers came quick and the staff was friendly we didn t try the food but it looked good and was reasonably priced we will definitely be back
  pizza rock never disappoints always fabulous food stuff you have to try antipasti classic meatballs insalata fried green tomato caprese italian dinners lasagna pizza the new yorker sliced mozzarella tomato sauce sliced house link sausage garlic pepperoni ricotta old chicago tomato sauce mozzarella provolone garlic italian fennel sausage sliced meatballs ricotta romano oregano pizza rock is a must try
  awesome food one of my fav places in scottsdale i prefer the biltmore location because the quarter can be a bit too snooty congested for me but both locations are great and highly recommended
  i went when it was really busy so my bad there but other than that the pizza was really good and everybody there was working hard it loses a star because it was so crowded and not enough people were there to help the customers
  great place went there half a dozen time now always with the same pleasure on the expensive side but worth it 3 starters grilled calamary fresh sardines carpaccio de pulpo 1 glass of douro wine white can 66
  this place is so good i had the breakfast sandwich and my friend got the oatmeal and fruit the owner is very friendly the hot tea was delicious the owner julian corles is very friendly and kind the food is fast and yummy we will be back the oatmeal is too die for
  we were all happy with our meals and the portions were huge so we ended up with doggie bags our server was very friendly and attentive first time at claim jumpers and it was a great experience
  food sandwiches comes with a salad or bag of chips i had the kale salad which was good 10 thinly sliced turkey slices of green apples parmesan cheese and sweet mustard sauce ohhhh this was so good my husband and i went halvsies so we can try both sandwiches and i wanted to steal his half lol the sandwich is indeed unique it s kind of like a pan fried crispy soft pita bread this was my favorite out of the two 5 5 20 thinly sliced turkey bacon avocado tomatoes shredded cheddar cheese and sweet mustard sauce this was good as well it was a little messier to eat because it was stuffed with fillings it too had good flavor 4 5 5 service the cashier was really friendly and talkative i did mention that i found zookz through yelp but the waitress failed to mention that if i checked in i would get 10 off i have a habit of checking in while i m waiting for my food in other words too late it would have been nice if she said something the owner stopped by to ask us how we liked our sandwiches she was really nice and approachable 5 5 final thoughts my husband doesn t ever compliment food everything is okay to him but he loved zookz he said it was one of the best sandwiches he s ever had if he likes it it s gotta be good i can t wait to come back here when i m in arizona
  oh black beans how i love thee blue burrito grille has a healthier menu such as those black beans and whole wheat tortillas which is great i ve came here to both pick up a meal and sit down and eat never having to wait more than 5 minutes for my food they have several high top tables outdoor patio seating a yummy salsa chip bar and alcohol the house margarita is okaaay bottom line if i m feeling fast mexican food and a lot of it i ll head to chipotle and down a burrito when i m feeling health conscious i head here
  good is ok but crazy long to get food and crazy long to pay never coming here again
  every time i come here which is at least once a month i have had a wonderful experience the service is great the chefs are social and switch up the routine from time to time birthdays are a blast i always recommend this place the sushi here is something i always look foreword to try the lisa lisa or the japanese lasagna
  i walked over here from my office one day for lunch i ve seen johnny s place many times driving down craig street but have never thought too much about it the place is a small stand alone building and looks very much like your local dive bar from the outside typically your local pittsburgh dive is dirty old and has personality which is really the regulars way of saying i know the bartender and all my drunk friends go there so thinking all that i ve never thought about going in there boy was i missing out we walked in and i was immediately proved wrong in many ways it is clean not old well decorated and really did have personality the owner bartender was a very attentive server read refills my beverage regularly without me having to hunt him down and from hearing his interactions with other tables very obviously proud of his food and his establishment the walls are completely covered with dedications to pittsburgh sports the steelers the penguins the pitt panthers and lots of photos and autographs johnny has obviously welcomed the best of da burgh s athletes if it s good enough for them rather than your neighborhood dive bar this place resembles more of your neighborhood sports bar now on to the food i had the teriyaki cheese steak and it was pretty tasty i heard johnny talk about his teriyaki buffalo wings to someone else and they seemed to like it i think he does a few dishes with his teriyaki sauce instead of the typical japanese teriyaki flavor this homemade sauce is a little more sweet and sour tasting it s good the menu is not your typical bar food menu it has the staples but also twists on normal dishes i m definitely going back to try different things one patron was walking out and said you can order anything you can t go wrong i don t know if he s yelp elite prob not but it s still a bold statement for any diner so definitely try it out if you re around the neighborhood i m not sure how crowded it gets in the evenings or during games but it s a great lunch place for sure i bet a lot of locals love johnny s place i m hoping i can get on a first name basis with johnny soon too
  ok if anyone s seen my other reviews for places i don t give a 5 star lightly i take into account price quality and quantity we accidentally stumbled into this place because poke express was closed it was fate intervening and wanting us to try this little piece of hawaii in vegas i had the mixed plate with kalbi and garlic chicken my husband had the moco loco and katsu chicken we also got a taste of the uncle willy s katsu and cream puff made of okinawa potato and chantilly cream my mouth is watering again just talking about it the kalbi wasn t the usual thin piece of meat the meat was thick juicy and i had more meat than rice to eat with the uncle willys katsu was crispy and a little bit honey my friends bought two servings to go it was so delish i know this is going to sound insane but their food is better than any hawaiian food i had in hawaii ok minus the macademian pancake and garlic shrimp food truck i m so happy that i don t have to fly 12 hours to hawaii to get good hawaiian food it s now only 6 hours away and here in vegas
  our whole office ordered delivery for lunch and we were more than satisfied i had the pad thai and chicken satay very good and the peanut sauce was to die for we will be ordering from here again for sure
  expensive by mexican food standards average price by las vegas standards our 10 margaritas were way too small but were pretty tasty i had a chicken burrito that was tasty and my girlfriend had some seared tuna tacos that were also good my biggest complaint was the price and the so so service
  worst mexican ever don t go there
  by far the best fast food ever loveeee the cheddar mac real comfort food
  i was incredibly disappointed with the service that i received in the afternoon sunday july 27 i made reservations via an online app and they were relatively prompt sitting us a slight annoyance was that they never removed my name from their list so the app kept texting me that my table was ready i had to go back to the hostess to change this next i was a bit annoyed that it took our server too long to greet us yes they were busy but in my section there were a lot of empty tables my boyfriend and i order immediately when he greets us it s 3 pm we decide to be simple to get in and out or so we thought i ordered the sliders and fries with a blue moon my boyfriend ordered a turkey burger and a side of fries my beer came 5 minutes later which is fine 20 minutes come around and i ask the waiter to check on the food my fear is another table getting my food sliders and burgers are common it s going on 3 30 pm i m beginning to get restless and not to mention hungry the server then brings on the excuses we just got a large influx of people so we re a bit swamped he tells me the manager will bring the food out 10 minutes later yep a total of 45 minutes after we ordered the manager kristopher brown comes out with the food all that he did was apologize and give me the same excuse that they re just busy other people that came in before us were in and out he offered nothing to us no discount no complimentary anything we felt like we didn t matter at all and that management didn t care about us after that i didn t have the time to even argue i guess i know where i stand i was greatly disappointed in the service and especially management
  such a great experience wait staff was outstanding very accommodating friendly and quick the food was absolutely amazing the most tender juicy steak i have had in a long time i had the bone in filet and my appetizer was the beef carpaccio overall this was one of the best dinners since moving here in january 2014
  i went here twice with my friends both turned out to be disaster their siu mai tasted so weird it like they cooked with ruber band or something also their chicken feet tasted not so good compared to phoenix place in chandler i would not come back to this place again if you would like to try every best dim sum i would recommend great wall at 35th and camelback in phoenix
  this place is amazing the ingredients hash house mixes together work wonders on the taste buds the soy based bar b que sauce used on my pork ribs was perfect i highly recommend hash house a go go to anyone within a 100 mile radius of one of their fabulous restaurants the trip and time will be well worth it come hungry leave happy the staff the i p hash house in las vegas are simply marvelous all staff i came in contact with were funny knowledgeable and caring thanks to steve the bar for the recommendation of the slow cooked pork ribs enjoy and tell everyone u know about hash house a go go
  i ve wanted to try jersey mike s for a while and it didn t disappoint not only was i greeted with joy when i walked in the door i was met with excitement over the fact that it was my first time there the sandwich was delicious and delightfully messy i got the 9 which is turkey roast beef and swiss i swapped it with provolone with no hassle i loved every bite i was also given a free cookie who can be mad about that no one no one can be mad at a free cookie
  i m only giving this place 2 stars because bianca refunded us the food was horrible we tried a little bit of everything and nothing had flavor or taste or it was burnt the sushi bar area had a nasty smell that not only is but over heard a few other people realize it and walked away for 72 for 2 people you would expect better food and less wait time i ve eaten better food and old country buffet for 15 a person that what i ate here not to mention as we were leaving some rude ignorant people were yelling at other customers yelling racist comments and no one stopped there to escort them out or stop them i will never come back to this hotel establishment my wife and i came here to watch the michael jackson show and was thrilled about eating here before the show and enjoying our time here we had issues straight from the beginning with our tickets so our start here was not a good one needless to say i m very disappointed in this hotel only thing good here was the show and the staff working the show i know my review will not be read or even looked at by the staff at mandalay bay but for those who are wondering how the food is at the buffet
  just off the road from a 12 hour trip and it was great to kick back in such a relaxed environment drinking a beer watching the game on tv and having a crazy sandwich
  we expected to like the food but everything served was less than mediocre i had the classic lasagna a house favorite i can t imagine how a dish like this could have been served in a restaurant unappealing little flavor no finesse and more like what you d expect from a frozen tv dinner if it was made by a chef that person might need to find a new line of work or find a better place to work as it is probably the chain restaurant s standards that are low they probably limit the food purchases to that which is the lowest quality food grade caesar salad was acceptable but nothing i d order again my wife s dish chicken parm was not great but acceptable desserts were commercial and average service was very pleasant and efficient food prices were not high but that didn t create a value for me would rather have well prepared higher quality food with portions much smaller but no left over food to go for me i didn t want to try that lasagne ever again this restaurant probably does a good bar business and food for those demanding little pizzas did look ok but we didn t try
  food options around my workplace are plentiful some are awesome some are meh thanks to yelp i found this hidden gem and i am extremely happy about it so far i have had a rueben sandwich an asian chicken salad and a burger here the rueben was really good and so was the burger the salads here are meh i had a greek salad that had 4 pieces of tomato and 4 cucumber slices stay away from the greens and stick to the sandwiches the owners are nice and no nonsense they have a great little place here
  poor brgr i went here about a week after i went to the new wingharts burger joint down in market square i think brgr would have held up in the bigger better burger contest if i had tried this burger first since it was after wingharts killer char grilled burger deliciousness it s sadly going to get a much lower rating don t get me wrong the shroomz burger at brgr i had to was tasty but it just doesn t hold a pickle to this other burger and by pickle i mean the tiny little gherkin they perch on the top of brgr s burgers the thing i will rave about was the boozy milkshakes i wish it was humanly possible to slurp down 5 of these like you can any other delicious cocktail but really that s not humanly possible without feeling like you re going to die i got the boozy almond milkshake which had ameretto and kahlua mixed in with ice cream to top that off there was sugary almond treats at the bottom my heaven would include these milkshakes being served at the pearly gates entrance the service initially was so so i had called earlier in the day to try and reserve a table for our party of 15 the person on the phone was a little pissy and told me they don t take reservations i said well i just want to let you know then that we have this large party coming in he said and i quote that they only had 70 seats with some being couches and two tops those 15 seats would take up most of their seating i m no mathematician but really dude do they not understand that we ll be spending a lot of money especially with the part of the crew that likes to overindulge on the booze so we get there and the hostess and what i assume are the manager are just walking back and forth around an l shaped area of seats and a longer set of seats i went up to them and was like we ll squish just put that long set of tables together i worked at a restaurant for 5 years i picked a thing or two up i suppose after that service was just fine i would totally go to brgr again and space out my boozy milkshake intake after a meal but i m not sure i would come back just for a burger so for brgr i say no burger but a round of boozy milkshakes for all
  everything was great the downside are the lines which are a really pretty long while not the restaurants fault it is something that you should keep in mind if you ve never been here all that been said i had a lovely time and the food was amazing and no one gave me funny looks when i got an extra egg to go on the side with my eggs
  can i give negative stars my boyfriend and i went into this restaurant for a drink while walking through old town we were welcomed in and told that there were 2 seats at the corner of the bar we sat and asked them what their on drink selection was since they were all over priced and we were just stopping by for a drink while we explored the area we ordered a beer each i accidently bumped into a customer that was wedged in the corner eating dinner when i went to sit in the high top chair i apologized to her and quickly we started up a conversation with this couple that was in their 50 s the manager rushes over asks the couple if they would like to move okay weird they said no i wasn t trying to intrude on their meal or anything and they did seem interested in the conversation as i turn back to the bar the bartender slaps our tab on in front of us he said here s your check please pay and leave i said excuse me and he responded you are a waste of space at my bar i was shocked never have i been treated like that or basically kicked out of a bar i have worked in customer service my entire life and i definitely do not deserved to be treated like trash i became infuriated as i responded are you serious all he said was leave and walked away from us my boyfriend said let s just get out of here this place sucks anyway as we walk out i see the manager as he ushers us towards the door and i told him what happened and he said i m sure this isn t the first time that you have been kicked out of somewhere what seriously what sparked all of this i like to have a good time i am social i love a good drink and great food what the hell never in my life have i ever been kicked out of somewhere and i cannot even begin to understand why i was kicked out of this restaurant bar for god sakes it is an italian restaurant with carpeting yuck and the manager or owner what ever he is such a d bag plus he appeared to be drunk or on drugs or something such a weird trying to be sauve high on something wanna be al pacino presence how do you run a business like this and survive i however cannot comment on the food since i will never ever go back there but with such horrible discriminating service who would ever go there save yourself the aggravation and do not help this jerk prosper with your hard earned money what a fake establishment they welcome you in to the bar from the street and then kick you out very questionable service to me
  hidden restaurant in a old dumpy hotel on the strip located in the royal resort however the barrymore serves excellent food and service started off with their signature cocktail the barrymore and lobster mac cheese for appetizer which was excellent and creamy with big chunks of lobster meat then had the short rib bourguignon that melted in my mouth i m sure i ll be back to this place
  this place is one of a kind i come here 3 4 times a week and we always feel so welcome they make us feel at home the music is so nice and not to loud before we found out about this place we used to go to deferent hookah lounges in vegas but all of them were dirty and the hookah wasn t so good i love how clean this place is they also serve some really good food and awesome appetizer menu the alcohol menu is large and the prices are very fair and sure the music is awesome very recommended
  romantic space with great view i had the duck foie gras ravioli which was quite good tasted a lot like beef stroganoff i don t drink so i asked for the bartender to make me something non alcoholic that was fruity sweet not sure exactly what it was but it was quite tasty the chocolate cake did not meet expectations though it was dry not sweet enough my husband i did not finish it
  the food was very good but the service was terrible my waiter made a series of rude jokes to my family and we never once got a refill on our drinks it took 30 minutes for our cheesecake to come and when i ordered a piece to go he gave me a much tinier piece than the others totally not worth the 8 i spent on it
  we ve been to squarz a few times now and plan to be repeat customers especially at their new tempe cafe we have tried the spinach and feta excellent with the addition of the dill and the breakfast one so far we have also sampled the croissants and we were surprised that they are better than the croissants at a place down the street of course their croissant donuts are yummy too in addition they are super friendly and nice at the cafe we are looking forward to trying their other creations soon
  so i was going to give this place 4 stars because the meatloaf i had was very good but beware of this place my friends and i dined here last weekend and the waiter stole money from two of my friends he forged their receipts and added extra tip for himself his name was andre smit doesn t he know that he has commited a crime i m sorry that such dishonest people work at your restaurant wolfgang
  last night i took my family that was visiting from out of state to my favorite pizza spot sadly it was the first time that i had an experience that i would rate less than 4 5 stars ocd version food 3 stars service 1 star service we had a reservation for our party of 8 and i was surprised to find that they were barely half full at this time previous experiences at this location had at least a small wait during peak times we were seated promptly we placed our drink orders but i was disappointed that there was really nothing sweet to drink other than water for my seven year old who doesn t drink soda or caffeinated products it would be nice if they had juice or lemonade i stepped away from the table and when i returned the drinks had come but not mine the server did not return for another ten or so minutes and when i informed him i did not get my iced tea he seemed to think i hadn t ordered anything we placed our orders for three small plates four pizzas and one pasta dish the three appetizers came out at the same time and were all fine it took about 20 minutes more for the first two pizzas to arrive and the remaining two took another ten minutes the pasta dish was a no show but we didn t get a visit from our server for quite a while because he was speaking to a table in the corner for over ten minutes i flagged down another server to inquire about the missing pasta dish he intercepted our server who proceeded to run over to the pos system and feverishly pound something into it he returned to our table with a comment about that he s not sure why the pasta hasn t come out but he will go check on it ten minutes later the pasta arrived he continued to spend time at that other table the rest of the evening never checking on how our food was overall the service was a display of willful neglect and the resulting unintended errors when it came time to pay the check sat on our table for another ten minutes while he visited with the table in the corner and with the little ones we had in tow we wanted to get out of there i had to take the bill and credit card to the front of the house to have someone run the card food that i sampled spiedini tasty albeit quite greasy i think that is hard to avoid given the ingredients marinara pizza this was good but somehow not as tasty as it was in the past the sacue was good but the other ingredients were flat rosa pizza typically my favorite pizza here tonight the flavor seemed off and all the pistacios were localized to one spot on the pie near the center spaghetti bianco dinapoli pomodoro basil parmigiano reggiano this was delicious as always a simple yet wonderful dish all this was so disappointing after talking this place up to my family and sad that this service experience happened while chris bianco was in the house i am torn as to whether i will give what was my favorite restaurant in town another try anytime soon
  this is a great old school steak house in las vegas i loved it
  the worst pad thai noodles ever it is not suppose to taste sweet i had plaque build up immediately on my teeth worst than eating a bag of candy
  we had the late night happy hour here because nothing else nearby was open for food i have to say we were pleased we stopped in we had two kinds of sliders main lobster rolls and the charcuterie plate everything was delicious service was excellent we had planned to go back but didn t get a chance to so next time we re in vegas we will
  one of the best viet restaurants in vegas reasonable prices good service i used to go here maybe twice a week when i lived in vegas
  i wasn t really impressed here i went with some friends and it was billed and being the real deal i don t know it felt for the price average so many great places to eat around here and this being as expensive as most anything i felt like it could have been better i had the lamb and it was good but a really petite portion drinks were over priced and the service was okay but didnt impress me so overall i wouldn t go back however the venue is really cool sitting outside in the center of that tower is a nice treat
  overview a loved space above state street that has a reliable bar and an increasingly reliable kitchen hits rooftop events seasonal wine pairings bread nuggets aka rolls locally sourced seasonal menu attentive staff and commitment to mmoca and madison in general misses any negative i have ever seen have been deleted thanks to new visionary leadership bottom line go eat and drink here as soon as possible
  not bad the food is good service was on point the view was great my wife had the quiche my buddy had the smoked salmon i had the steak sandwich we each said the same 3 stars
  excellent food great date night place the place for foodies had the venison tartare and it was one of the best tartare i have tasted to date very flavorful and fresh it was deconstructed so the bread crisps were sprinkled on top almonds was a very nice touch also had the sweetbread with zucchini rolls and flowers sweetbread was laced with a drizzle of an umami balsamic sauce which paired very well best way prepared not overlooked and still moist wine was very good and was often a taste before deciding on one service was excellent as well definitely will be back
  great food we got sweet manna omelette we went their for the first time today to try something new loved it we will be going back for sure
  went here for my birthday meal with my best girlfriends and was pleasantly surprised our server was friendly attentive full of smiles and good recommendations i ordered the black sea bass which was cooked absolutely perfectly by far the best sea bass i ve ever had we also ordered steak mushrooms asparagus and a cheeseburger with hush puppies the mushrooms oh the mushrooms i could eat a bowl of those everyday the steak was obviously good too but comparable to most any other steak house the only draw to this restaurant is it s extremely loud otherwise the food is great and the price is fair for the quality
  great food service food did not take long if you do end up complaining about service then maybe its your horrible greedy attitude
  my daughter recently moved nearby despite a bunch of negative reviews we decided to check it out anyway 4 of us went here for lunch my my my what a pleasant surprise i was expecting due to the negative reviews a real s hole but upon entering the decor is actually very pleasant it does not have that typical bar rundown needs updating appearance and from what i was able to observe they try to keep it clean even the men s bathroom was clean the servers were not just wiping the tables clean either they were spraying them with sanitizer and then wiping them on to the food as i said it was lunchtime and they had a pretty good crowd for lunch it took a while for our server to get to us but once she did the service was excellent prompt drink service and didn t have to ask for refills she kept our glasses full everyone enjoyed their food a burger club sandwich and 2 different salads not only did the food taste good the presentation was excellent as well nobody in our party ordered dessert we were all too full they do have a dessert case with some scrumptious looking selections though we all agreed we would return to the getaway cafe as i said before all of the negative reviews of this place made me a bit skeptical i am glad we checked it out anyways based on the fact that my daughter lives in this neighborhood now we will return and when i do i will update this review if the food service decor changes so will the rating based on 1 visit though i was impressed oh one more thing i saw several complaints in previous reviews about this place being overpriced i d say they are about average the days of the 5 hamburger are about gone this is 2013 while they may be a buck or two higher than some places our bill for lunch for a party of 4 drinks included tax included was 44 considering that a value meal at mcdonald s is about 6 now that s not too bad
  i do love the view here i am a people watcher and can view the whole strip and watch the bellagio fountains plus it s rare that i get my perfect weather day in vegas so i bask outside whenever i can i get very simple things here and they are good i am a pate person their country pate and chicken liver mousse are happy pleasure of mine me bread and charcuterie whore i usually just snack and dont commit to serious eats while watching people so thats my usual breakfast i ve had the butterscotch waffles with poached pears and it was a nice topping sweet but not overwhelmingly so i have not had dinner here yet i ve gone off trying most breakfast lunch items but i just keep it to those simple three usually not that the other items are bad ive gotten a short rib cheese sammy escargot scallops gratinees seafood crepe and enjoyed each i just like french simplicity to go for the view
  the food is pretty good but i have a bad feeling that it s very high in calories they don t list their nutrition info anywhere so you know that can t be good i don t care if items have a lot of calories i just want to know so i can decide on the upside most of the soups are very good and i really like the grilled panini sandwiches especially the chicken pesto the only other thing i d say is that they should re think their packaging i have rarely seen so much waste paper wrappers inside of plastic containers inside another bag
  one of the best pizza places in town good food and they have great lunch specials
  wow best mexican ever and that s what i eat out fry bread is one of a kind go next door for great service and nice people
  i love to stop at new places especially truck stop dinning for sure like usual affordable and huge portions i love how everything comes out on a skillet try this place out when you are leaving north out las vegas if you are into good comfort food with big portions
  spicy and delicious this place delivers next time i m in vegas ill be back don t get too excited about the man vs food thing though this place has it s own character
  try the pork belly ramen and kimchi fried rice with one their awesome specialty coctails
  i hate giving one star but this place was just bad what a big disappointment there was not one item on this buffet worth coming back for i only got one not fully loaded plate and that was it for the night i had to fill my stomach with their chicken noodle soup since there was nothing worth eating the quality and presentation of the food was way below average i would put them in the circus circus category yet i paid almost 40 per person and the person who served cut the salmon kept screaming at me asking me to get the salmon and when i said no thanks he kept asking why not and kept selling how wonderful the salmon was well if it was that good then why did it looked so dried and no one was in line for it it made the whole experience cheap like he was a street vendor trying to sell me food omg they had a 1 2 lobster per person but the meat on the lobster was really tough to eat it was totally overcooked and the unlimited wine sorry but i was there for the food what good does the wine do if the food sucks
  having spent a lot of time in wickenburg and seeing restaurants come and go this has to be the best restaurant in recent memory great remodeled interior with plenty of private spaces delicious food and friendly service next time i visit the area this is going to be my go to grub hub
  well pgh you may have finally done it you may have an actual decent if not good mexican restaurant in your midst i ve been sampling mexican from leetsdale to lawrenceville and been mostly disappointed but now they re onto something a great looking space xlnt service and delicious food chips and salsa and tortillas top notch my carnitas chile verde was super tender and tasty a little heavy on the salt but haven t had such good mx since leaving sf bay also very generous drinks i m def going back to try other dishes go dig
  i so enjoyed my enchilada plate their salsa is so fresh and their chips are extra yummy as well the server was very friendly and quick to take our order and refill our drinks
  i m not impressed pricing is high and samurai sam s in my opinion gives you more food and is much better taste wise and selection wise i tried this place because it had a coupon for free chicken bowl from the rj so i decided to go down the street to try it they should include veggies for the price you are paying good thing i got it for free
  i came here for valentine s day and was seriously disappointed walking into the place there was no host to greet or seat us we had reservations and ended up walking around the empty tables looking for the one with our name on it we finally chose a table and the food was pretty good but my date asked for a steak knife to cut her lamb with and our server said the place had no steak knives also our wine was served in tumbler glasses
  good burgers awesome bartenders happy hour what more could you ask for my favorite locals bar by far
  great local hawaiian food good local hawaiian music convenient location with that retro 50 s diner look all in all a great place to eat
  after hearing some reviews on this place i thought i would give it a try the dinner here as a whole was a failure the food came out at all different times drinks took forever to arrive as did other items and i won t be back seemed like the restaurant was way understaffed the food was good but not worth the horrible service
  i came here once with a restaurants com gift card and i can t believe how all over the place these reviews are our food was great the service was polite the chef was attentive i didn t get a refill as often as i d like sat with an empty cup until i was about to leave and there was a really loudmouth ass at the sushi bar with his lady friend it was nice and empty about 4pm on a weds i d return especially with a coupon
  while visiting from out of town my sisters took me here for my birthday dinner i had the bbq salad vegetarian make sure you tell them vegetarian or you ll get chicken it was delicious when my sister told our server that it was my birthday she said they would bring out a red velvet cupcake after my meal she did with a lit candle nice touch thanks
  great spot in downtown we visited for lunch and they mistakenly gave us a dinner menu we didn t get to order from that but it definitely put it in our minds that we need to return at night for lunch we started with the gyoza these were very nice i had the curry dish excellent reasonable portions i only would have wanted for a little more rice to mix in with the left over curry sauce
  this place is amazing the sandwiches are delicious and the soup is really good too it gets pretty busy at times but what do you expect when the food is so good the staff is friendly and the location is good a bit pricey but again it s extremely tasty and always fresh the portions have always been enough for me
  i ate here for lunch the menu selection was very limited it is better to try this restaurant for dinner
  another one opens up another crowded spot this is my 3rd hash house and definitely my least favorite one we were enough not to have to sit through a long wait to get seated on new years morning when we arrived the place was crowded but i guess we just got lucky although by the time we left the restaurant the waiting area was completely packed anyway we sat at a booth towards the back of the restaurant our server was nice and friendly she checked on us frequently even though it was obvious that she was running around servicing multiple large groups i ordered the andy s sage fried chicken salad while others in my party had the popular dishes chicken and waffles pancakes fried chicken eggs benedict my salad just like all of their dishes was ginormous a house bowl of salad with caramlized pecans apple slices two pieces of the fried chicken and the big ol biscuit i asked for the mango dressing on the side i have had the sage fried chicken at other locations and this time my chicken was completely bland what happened i was soooo disappointed i still think they have really good food here with over the top portions at good prices but honestly this experience has killed it for me i was afraid this was going to happen they grow too fast open too many locations and suddenly the quality of food goes down i really hope they make the proper adjustments soon
  disappointed stopped in for dinner and ordered mac n cheese we were told 5 minutes after 3 trips to the counter and was told 5 more minutes each time and still nothing i finally asked if it could be delivered to our table the girl said no because they didn t know who ordered and such so i needed to check back after 25 minutes we were done with our meal i went up to find it finally was brought out i just requested my money back joe really needs to get his act together his staff really does not know how to deal with people we have been coming for years we stopped going out to the grill which was another one of our favorites after having bad service a few times it may be time to cross joes bbq off our list too what happened to customer service or go the extra mile for the customer ever here the story give them the pickle by bob farrell it may be time to have your employees google it
  the ultimate calzone i ve had a lot of calzones and this one takes the cake hands down i think i could eat one every day made with ricotta and whatever you want even the marinara to dip in is extra fabulous friendly staff always busy i hear the pizza is good too
  i was debating between a 3 and a 4 because kelly s has some definite high points i met a friend at kelly s for happy hour and it was fairly happy the best part of the experience was our waitress who was friendly and helpful throughout our visit she was fantastic even when i was being ridiculously indecisive anyway we each got a drink i got the az mule and my friend had basically a vodka cranberry both drinks were fine but nothing special for food i had the pork wings and the short rib tacos the pork was alright tender and covered in a flavorful sauce but the meat itself was a little gamey tasting they were served over a super tasty spicy slaw which i could have eaten all day despite this i don t think i would order this again the tacos were also fairly tasty 3 tiny tacos with hot red peppers on top of short rib how bad can it be again it was good but not something i would crave necessarily all the food and drink were reasonably priced on hh i would come back here but maybe order a bit differently next time ps i don t know what was going on but their bathroom when i went was missing a door handle and a lock could make for an awkward night pps i really want to try their burgers they looked really tasty
  coq au vin big enough to feed me and the guy outside fresh baked bread huge beautiful salad and very nice service we had a great dinner here for half the price of other restaurants on the same street payment process was at the bar kinda weird but c est la vie i guess oh the location is right in the center of everything in old town montreal steps from the piano rouge jazz bar and just around the corner from the notre dame basilica if you re trying to save some sous the food here is the right price and well done
  this is my son s favorite restaurant we come during off game times and the food and service is wonderful they give the kids alice cooper face paint
  we came to lunch here twice the first time we ordered the fried rice eggplant and chinese roast pork char siew the egg plant was very well done we absolutely loved it the fried rice was too dry it might be because they were not using the right grains the roast pork was pretty average and too dry we told the waiter we were in a rush and asked about the waiting time for the food he assured us that the food would come very fast and so we decided to order chinese food instead of some simple sushi rolls we waited about 15min for the food which really felt like forever but i guess is a rather reasonable time s the second time we ordered the fried calamari hainanese chicken rice and steamed sea bass the fried calamari was very well done the batter was tasty and the calamari chewy and soft the sea bass was just slightly overcooked in my opinion but this could be my personal preference the hainanese chicken rice was disappointing for me being a singaporean tasting this singaporean dish i had high expectations for it the chicken sauces and soup were ok but the rice was wrong the real chicken rice served rice cooked with chicken oil and pandan leaves this one replaced it with coconut milk rice instead i guess it could still work but i m not a fan of coconut milk rice at all so i didnt quite enjoy it if you re interested in overpriced but decently ok chinese food this could be the place for you
  this is a quick service sushi concept and as such they re doing a great job they are quick and affordable the sides are great there is plenty to choose from and i love the chirashi bowls sometimes it s 2 o clock already ali baba is closed and you know that kohli s will be out of lunches or you don t want a sandwich or a bagel you don t want to eat at a sit down place and you definitely don t want to pay more than 10 sushi fuku rescues my picky self about once a week however dear eater if you come in expecting a japanese restaurant you will be disappointed they are quick they are cheap and they don t give a damn about how much soy sauce you re going to pour all over your fish
  i didn t know pt s could differ much from one to another after all they re a chain that sells alcohol and food we came here on a friday night a bit late at 12 30am i loved the layout of this place the place wasn t lonesome like other pt s there were a lot of people hanging out and they seemed to be a bit more social as well pool tables are a nice touch food pizza 1 star the crust is like cardboard with no flavor i d skip this entirely chicken strips 4 stars spicy gets you the buffalo sauce yummy flavor and great crunch definitely the winner nachos 3 stars service was not bad it does get busy however due to the hh from 12 2am of all the pt s this one might be worth coming to
  best authentic made when you order scandinavian food ever forget ikea lol this is fresh delicious great service and super friendly owners and family i will bring all my friends and family here for years to come without hesitation this place does not cut corners they make the food only once it has been ordered this is a truly a great place and i never write reviews since finding amazing places is rare for me this place makes it worth sharing go try it 5 stars
  whack bang on the royal mile it is a frequent with fellow foreigners who wish to try what scotland has to offer it has a great ambience for couples the beef tartare starter was beautifully seasoned and a good portion for starter one of the best i have tried in edinburgh very well prepared by the chef i then had the lamb rump as the main and it didn t disappoint me either pink and perfectly cooked with affection it is one of the best lamb dish i have ever tried in edinburgh the earl grey panna cotta sounds weird at first for a dessert but omg best panna cotta ever you need to try this the earl grey really blend well with the ingredient in the panna cotta angel of bagpipes certainly does impress when it comes to red meat but today all the 3 dishes deserves a 10 out of 10 from me i ll definitely be back to try the other dishes i highly rate this restaurant for both locals and foreigners alike who wishes to sample scottish food at its best
  i love it when locally owned and operated restaurants survive in lv the place is absolutely cute with their huge flowers spinning from the ceiling and the servers in their pajamas this is one of my favorite spots to do breakfast on the weekends everyone i bring here raves about the place too the food is really good some of the notable things i ve had here include chicken fried steak thick and delicious gravy steak might be a little too thickly battered feel a little guilty eating it tasty hash browns on the side two egg breakfast think grand slam but much tastier not crazy about the kielbasa so i ll stick with the sausage or bacon next time corned beef hash not like the smushy corned beef its real southwest turkey panini panini s here seem like a good option for lunch and always get their cute little pot of bread a light and fluffy cinnamon roll yum like everyone else says the service here is good always kind with a smile i wouldn t say the food is omg but its solid prices might be a tiny bit on the more expensive side but i think it s worth it for the lovely experience
  best fish and chips i ve had in pittsburgh the rest of the menu looked really good too will definitely be going back
  the concept is awesome however the service is terrible we got there 30 minutes before our movie time and and it took that entire time to even get waited on at the bar plus the bartender had no idea what she was doing on the bright side the milkshakes and sangria we delicious
  if ever there is a magical place where delicious food flavorful cocktails delightful and friendly service existed my friends this is it i will continue to return time after time you can t go wrong here
  service was great food was delicious
  wow i didn t expect such great food and experience for such reasonable prices friendly staff and great service i highly recommend you give this a try
  another wonderful dinner at this cute restaurant we each had salads which were very good and huge i had the lamb bolognese and my wife had the whole trout both dishes were excellent the restaurant wasn t very busy on a sat night which amazes me one of the better dining places in pittsburgh
  overpriced food full of chillies preparation h to the rescue we ordered a plate of channa bhatura and dosa sambhar for starters unfortunately thats where the meal ended as well the bhatura was a thick doughy ball not cooked very well on the inside the channa s are better out of trader joe s freezer section the south indian coffee and dosa sambhar was average the sambhar and coconut chutney come in a doll sized petri dish the menu clearly states that all appetizers would be accompanied with a bowl of soup and coconut chutney when asked why the channa bhatura was not served with the mentioned accompaniments we were told that that was the old menu and now there is new ownership so the menu is not as it reads 3 4 confused wait staff running around with very poor communication skills when asked to speak to the owner as it is under new ownership was told he is an absentee owner the manager in a blue tee shirt was constantly on his cell phone and couldn t be bother to speak with us
  i ve only been for a couple of drinks so far so take my thoughts with a grain of salt service was relatively quick and there was a decent beer special but other than that i didn t really see anything that stood out about this place first of all the door is basically jammed me having an ankle injury that day didn t make my first impression that great i literally came shoulder first through the door i sat with some friends and took a couple minutes for me to get a beer there were some tv s and some stuff to look at but seemed like no real substance to the place with so many other places to drink in the area i think the only time i ll be here is when taking a break from amos i ll give the food a try some time and update accordingly
  went there with my husband and a friend who was in town we were seated quickly and the server was nice the food came out and the order was wrong but no big deal we ate it anyway it was just average food not really worth the cost but maybe i should try something different wouldn t seek it out but wouldn t avoid it
  order twice in the past two weeks and i completely loved it had it delivered to my apartment and it was quick the girl that answers the phone is awesome very positive vibe love it
  i ve gotten pizza delivered from this place 100 s of times and have never had a problem i went and ate at the restaurant and can honestly say i will never order from them again sarah our waitress is the most unprofessional person i have ever met working in the restaurant business i m glad i don t have any employees like her absolutely awful
  the only good thing about this place is that it s open later then usually places and there s happy hour don t eat their food or expect good customer service
  im so glad i found this place i used to go to jenny pho but they just kept getting worse and worse when i tried this place i fell in love with their broth they have the strong taste and i love that also their customer care was exceptionally good and they give you big portions i would definitly recommend this place
  fries bomb cheesesteak bomb place bomb they just need to clean up a little bit bathrooms were a little dirty
  when cheesecake introduced their monstrosity to the biltmore years ago i was turned off by breathless staff pushing drinks and skimpy desserts and by longer waits than a gp s office in flu season but i have to say that over time i ve warmed to this conglomerate even as i subsequentyly learned that eating here regularly might kill me the staff has settled in and mostly toned it down and now our entire family revolves through cf s front door with confidence and suspiciously early for dinner to avoid waiting room rigor mortis overall food preparation is at least one notch below houston s across the street and one notch above adjacent cpk which is more impressive than it sounds considering the legendary breadth of cheesecake s menu it s all respectably prepared if fattening and often quite good i like the fish tacos standard fish but massive fixins and the portabella and asparagus omelette mom gravitates towards sublime corn tamale cakes and chris is seduced by a salad presented in two huge conical mounds he likes to call dolly parton there s an item or two on this menu to pique anyone s interest and while the factory probably wont serve up your best meal ever unless you dont get out much a truly disappointing meal here is rarer than steak tartare portions are large and we almost always pass on dessert not the kind of restaurant to whip out an engagement ring in this is a factory after all but a safe choice for the family stargazing suns opponents staying at the ritz eat here all the time or a pre movie dinner date well safe until you die
  very friendly staff delicious sushi there a re a lot of sushi places in town this one is legit
  i ordered the crab fried rice and my friend had the kim chee fried rice they were both good but the price wasn t i thought it was a little too high
  when did cec become so cheap all games used to be one token they update their mascot and the cheap rat raises the price of the games to two tokens per game and yet the price of the tokens hasn t changed lame
  this place is pretty exceptional the pho is delicious the broth noodles meat are all tasty and good quality the prices are unbeatable sandwiches are 3 50 the service is great drinks always refilled waiter checks up on you often i already know that i will be returning to this place quite a lot
  normally this ism a great place for prime rib well the other day my wife and i went there and it was sub par poor quality and over cooked i hope this is not a trend
  love it just wish i got bigger servings if the macaroni the employees are awesome
  my parents were in town and i foolishly made a reservation here i feel like an idiot for not reading between the lines of all the fake yelp reviews first i usually try to filter potential fakes but i was searching for a good place and i had to find this place i figured that a place with a great city view would be a good idea so my parents could enjoy it and the online menu looked decent enough and they had a few items for me it looked nice when we walked up to the place dark and very loud after we walked inside this place is perfect if you are looking for a mexican chuck e cheese with inflated prices and i am sure the owner is laughing every day at the stupidity of people like me for dining there i live here in vegas so i had no excuse i just hope my parents can forgive me for taking her there very loud dark cigarette smokers bad service nasty food drinks were watered down water glasses were dirty chips salsa were good nice view never ever again
  so the yelpers who gave this place one star don t know what their talking about i just strayed from this place and ate at this god awful sui wok place and boy will i never do that again now i am from new york and having said that i will say that i have dined in some of the best places in china town and eaten some of the best hangover food in brooklyn and when it comes to chinese this is as good as it gets in phoenix the hot and sour soup is awesome it has all the bells and whistles of the proper mushrooms and spices the food is cheap and the portions are huge now ok yes the orange chicken isn t going to be like panda express because that s completely different but come on its spicy and good and not dry and you can really tell they are actually making everything instead of heating everything up from some plastic ready made food bag it was voted the best chinese in the phoenix new times for a reason because it is the best in phoenix my only qualm is that some of the dishes are served as a chicken cutlet style instead of individual deep fried pieces once again phoenix the fact that some crappy place like sui wok is getting better reviews that this little gem makes me doubt your citizens even more hooray for autumn court i love you
  my wife and i recently moved to glendale and hit the jackpot of indian food here we were not expecting to find an indian food place as good as where we came from but tandoori topped it it is reasonably priced the staff are very attentive and friendly and everything made tastes fresh if you like indian food i would absolutely recommend tandoori times 2
  the dinner buffet was great dessert was delicious staff was well trained price was a little high but the food made up for it nice dinning area
  the scallops were recommended by our server and they were delicious the butter sauce was so good and perfect on the pallet our server was friendly and professional thanks to josh out experience was perfect
  i love this place i only gave it 4 stars because i feel like their prices are a little high but it s still really good i used to work down the road from this place and everything that i tried was amazing their cobb wrap tuna sandwich harvest salad are all great they have a half sandwich half salad or soup which is great they have different soups every two days and don t forget their delicious cookies or fruit and yogurt parfait with granola it s to die for
  outrageous in price with mediocre food and a snobbish atmosphere for the amount of money you pay one would expect better quality the society salad i ordered was totally bland and chopped into such small pieces that i almost had to use my spoon i didn t realize i had ordered baby food the service was not any better there was just an air of arrogance that made our experience uncomfortable
  not sure why so many love this place it s probably the wow factor of the massive portions as you are being served to me it s just average food with huge portions been here at least 6 times now with friends that love to go here but i never seem to leave satisfied great for bacon lovers since they seem to put it in everything except your drink i don t eat pork they put sage in just about everything too to me they try to make food too fancy and pretty i wish they would just make it simple and tasty i would rather go to ihop
  i think this place is out of business no wonder it sucked
  i love baby kay s like pirates love stealing it s good enough to wipe clean the memory of taking a horrible girlfriend there for our first date the craw fish ettouffe is something i have to stop to contemplate each bite of because i struggle to comprehend why it s so delicious the gumbo and jambalaya are also stellar i like to merge all three in the cajun combination they make a raspberry vinaigrette there that deserves it s own paragraph and is mandatory on your dinner salad another fantastic creation here is the apricot habenero glaze that one would think would over power a chicken salad not the case now i know most of you see the h word and imagine terrible pain this dish is not prohibitively hot it manages to catch the flavor of the much maligned pepper and only a fraction of its fire if you happen upon baby kay s on a day when the special is seafood enchiladas get them and call me for a refund if you anything less than amazed staff is pretty low key and nice here not a good call if you re in a hurry but worth being late over i usually sit at the bar if minutes are precious and outside if my time is my own for what you get the prices are very reasonable
  grat for all ages brings me back to the good old days with some games had a blast and they have a bar with food and a lot of tv s will bring my kids n family here
  absolutely dreadful service we never got our food at the grab and go section after 35 mins and no one barely in the kitchen they hadn t even started our order so we demanded our money back if i could put a massive zero on this i would
  don t go here right when they open they seem to have an attitude that they have to make pizza at least everyone that came in got the same great treatment
  delicious everything we ordered was so good the curry is great i had the chicken and it did not taste fake at all the mango salad was great too everyone in my family enjoyed which is a feat
  mom pop establishment with some darn tasty gyros and some of the best fries i ve had at any restaurant they have an eclectic menu with some standard american fare but the gyros are top notch it s nearly unnoticeable from the street and i m kicking myself for not finding it sooner as i live just up hayden mediterranean food at its finest like a schwarma slingin food truck parked in a strip mall and never found it necessary to move easy on the stomach and the wallet the 16 gyro combo is the way to go heard nothing but raves about the salad from the table of red hat ladies next to us and i fell in love with the tahini after first bite the obligatory sriracha sauce adorned the table and mixed in with the ketchup for the fries made for a pleasant and fiery surprise i highly suggest giving this place a try the next time you re in the area instead of wasting your money and time at the nearby bk lounge family owned by friendly people dedicated to bringing the best mediterranean fare i ve had in the valley give your tastebuds a treat today
  best thai food i have ever had great portion sizes and they didn t skimp on protein to vegetable ratio very reasonable prices i highly recommend if you are looking to eat some great thai food
  amazing food we ordered delivery by the bite squad around 3 30 on a monday afternoon everything arrived fresh and piping hot the fish tacos were wonderful they had a nice crunch and a yummy sauce the lamb chops were delicious they had a great flavor and we re cooked perfectly and the sauce and couscous with feta that comes with it was scrumptious hard to pick a favorite between the lamb chops and the spicy shrimp diablo the diablo sauce was delicious it was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy i like spicy and there was plenty of sauce for bread dipping i will definitely try this place again
  if you were a fan of the carlos n charlie s on sunset fuggedabout this joint it sucks while the waiter was charming and handsome as all get out not even his beautiful smile could make up for the fact that those in the kitchen could not cook worth a damn there is no one in that kitchen worthy of being called a chef they did not even put all of the ingredients in the dish i guess i was not supposed to notice there was no chorizo in my quesadilla really not everyone that visits vegas is from podunk the margarita was good the end
  fish tacos are great here the bean burrito is huge this is a better alternative to any of the near by fast food joints
  orange table is one of the best spots for breakfast and lunch in scottsdale the omelettes are out of this world as well as the sandwiches their selection of craft beers and house made specialty cocktails complement the food very well especially their bloody mary i found their flannel dishes to be on the salty side and so far this has been the only negative i ve found the friendly staff unique to orange table and the old town scottsdale scene are engaging entertaining and informative orange table is a truly unique addition to the otherwise competitive breakfast and lunch niches that old town is popular for
  the largest tequila selection in phoenix puts this place high on the list of my favorite north central phoenix mexican food spots it is awesomely tacky and the crowd at via delosantos is always ready to have a good time of course it s hard not to have a good time when they have great margaritas for 99 cents at happy hour the food is good the service is good but the drinks and drink specials are great expletive deleted
  really delicious food nice and unobtrusive staff lovely table setups however and i ve never taken a star off for ambience before they re next door to something with a lot of thumping or at least while i was there it sounded like i was sitting right next to a dryer working on a waterlogged coat with giant buttons really a mood killer the fish pakora was beautiful though incredibly tender and juicy on the inside delicately crispy on the outside with just enough ginger to balance out the flavor next time i m in the area i will unquestionably buy fish pakora for take out
  came by to check out the karaoke interesting place gets packed standing room crowd was chill not snobby beer was 3 bucks from the outside it doesn t look to inviting walking in same feel not a lot to write home about but that s what made this place even better didn t feel like dressing up to go club hopping just wanted to chill and this place is a great spot for that did not get a chance to eat at the restaurant some reviews say waiting can drag out but the food is supposed to be killer maybe next time again came for the karaoke was not disappointed except maybe try coming in earlier to get a table or a spot at the bar i got there about 11pm
  we chose this restaurant based on the reviews it was even better than expected waitress joedee has a dynamic personality and enhanced the entire dining experience the fish tacos were delicious mango chutney gave the dish great flavor the hushpuppies had a unique taste and were definitely homemade bravo to the chef the pulled pork sandwich was outstanding fries cooked perfectly crisp as we requested definitely try this if u r in the neighborhood and even if you are not
  overrated no seating until all members if party have arrived so we awkwardly hovered over empty tables the second bummer here was the lack of french fries which is borderline criminal when you offer a burger the bun was dry the burger was ok generous portion of meat though nothing special here the crowd here is about as un diverse as you can get not sure what all the hype is about
  another fox winner food is delicious very fresh and top quality ingredients we had the mediterranean salad and the hippie chick wrap both were fabulous the flavored lemonades are wonderful you will definitely love this restaurant can t wait to go back servers are friendly and very attentive and you actually see a manager on the floor who is watching everything and on top of things
  the beans and rice here is fantastic the tacos not so much which is a shame because tacos beans rice is a fantastic meal i don t know if the tacos are made the same but the very last time i ordered them they were no good the taco grease destroyed the bottom of the taco making in inedible my nana and mom love the burritos tamales and the chips yummy good place to go but avoid the tacos
  best wings on mill 100x better than hooters in my opinion and the atmosphere during any sporting even is unmatched great grill even better bar
  shogun is one of my favorite spots to grab a few rolls it is the only place in the valley that i have found that serves wahoo otherwise known as ono the spicy wahoo roll the wahoo sashimi and the sunset roll are two of my absolute favorites i have been stopping by for years and it is consistently good i have a lot of friends that are fans of the godzilla tails too oh the tempura onion rings are the best onion rings i have ever had i will continue visiting this favorite little spot
  i have been here two times same server same unpleasant service he was training someone else but himself was incapable slow forgetful unprofessional just not what you would expect from a restaurant that is trying to be a scottsdale classy place ambiance nice classy enjoyable baby friendly food decent smaller proportions i like their tomato creamy sauce and bruschetta service below average
  we finally got up our courage to try mel s again after the disaster we experienced last year well this time i ordered the monte christo dry so dry i had trouble choking it down the turkey was so dry it fell apart the thick bread read westons wonder bread was barely dipped in egg and fried prior to adding the filling not the way it is supposed to be done which is dipped in egg after being made i saved the turkey and salty little slice of ham for the dog dipped the sad dry bread in the maple syrup and called it dinner the caesar salad on the side was good but a small caesar does not make a dinner the milkshake was delicious as usual my daughter took a chance and ordered a jerry lee burger it was quite literally dripping mayo and mustard all over her and her plate puddles of the stuff somebody in there lost their mind putting on the condiments her coleslaw was meh and i m a coleslaw lover couldn t eat it the fries were just ok when she finally got rid of the very soggy bun soaked in mayo etc and tried the burger meat she found the meat itself was delicious unfortunately all the crap they drowned it in managed to completely hide the lovely flavour of the burger the mushrooms tasted canned if we ever go back it will be to order the burger with nothing on it shakes delightful service very good two very pleasant and attentive waitresses speed of getting the food pretty good and the restaurant was busy just wish they would hire a decent line cook such a nice tempting menu and twice disappointed now
  excellent pizza definitely authentic ny pizza
  i have never been to a subway where they have been out of so many things when i went in they were out of chicken italian herbs and cheese bread and dollar bills it was the middle of the day on a saturday so this was inexcusable for me the service was also incredibly slow it took me nearly 15 minutes to get my sandwich it was a painful experience that s for sure the only thing that saves this place is its location besides that their service definitely needs some work
  looking for an affordable vegas meal with great people watching if so this is right up your alley you will find that the kitchen is open all night and the staff is truly at your service sit back and watch every type of person you might find in a classy vegas casino all from the comfort of the tables in the lounge area across from the bar you gotta love it
  pretty good for lunch too crowded for dinner
  the pizza is so very good the kids pizza is huge lol the zucchini sticks were so good i ve gone back for those alone numerous times the staff is very family friendly and make you feel at home my only complaint is it is so very hot inside i can no longer eat here because it s way too hot to enjoy a hot meal especially when it s already 110 outside and probably 80 inside at least
  was tasty and not too expensive
  went there today because my friend was craving dim sum so we decided to check this place out since she said it was under new management and she already tried their dim sum just this past summer well we both realized that going there was a mistake i m not trying to be rude here but i did not undertsand anything the servers were telling me so i had to keep asking my friend what they are saying dim sum looked like it was made a while ago they were not fresh the sticky rice thing we bought we left it just as it is because it wasn t doing any good anything with yhe rice was not good at all and i have had dim sum before but i was surprised the way they serve it the only thing we liked was the egg custard and the coconut jelly we had for desert not going back
  as a long time diner of earlier ruth s chris in las vegas was wondering if the new location at harrah s would be as good or better certainly better the room is up one floor from the casino therefore noise wasn t a problem service was excellent and not overbearing overall a great experience we will return
  schwartz vs katz first time trying smoked meat was dunn s in vancouver so the first thing we ate while in montreal for the gran prix was the infamous schwartz s smoked meat but before the visit i read some articles montreal vs nyc of how schwartz s was better better even than the king of all jewish delis katz in nyc now if i ve never had smoked meat or a katz pastrami before to compare especially 4 days later i would ve agreed but i have and did http tinyurl com montreal vs nyc first schwartz s smoked meat vs dunns is not the same dunns was more pastrami like in seasonings and flavor while schwartz s is more corned beef to the new there s a huge difference in look but even more important in taste pastrami is bolder smokier and one they forgot darker not just in its crust but the color of the meat pastrami also uses the naval and corned beef uses the brisket and there is a difference in texture and a bite and to the point of this review the writers and bloggers in the link does not know what they are talking about or they forgot to use the word preference mind you ive only had smoked meat twice vancouver and montreal and katz countless times while in ny 25yrs one could even say that i m a bit bias but i haven t had a katz pastrami since 2012 and while ive had other delis in la in between i haven t tasted a katz pastrami for nearly 3 years so my palate has been pretty much katz s free i think im able to make a fair comparison having had both in a span of 4 days and if schwartz s was better i have no problem stating that nothing on this planet comes close to a katz pastrami noth innng not even katz corned beef can touch their pastrami even if you say that you ve had both my next question how many days apart and did you have it to stay while it was still hot i will upload two pictures of both sandwiches and feel free to message me who looks better and tell me which one would make you run out and get one also one was close to room temp and the other a bit warmer cause of the steamers they use before slicing katz other differences is their choice of mustard katz uses what we call deli mustard spicy and schwartz s uses yellow ordered the smoked meat medium with no mustard and katz juicy also no mustard but one was on rye the other on club bread nyc both looked juicy and both had a very distinct and different aroma based on smell alone katz made my mouth water more and i was hungrier while at schwartz s texture its katz all the way brisket when cooked too long will fall to pieces and that s why its used for american slow smoked bbq katz was like biting into an aged prime cut of steak cooked perfectly tender and juicy you really can t go wrong with either one but it comes down to if you like bolder vs milder if you like nirvana in your taste buds then its katz but if you like vivaldi then its schwartz s with or without mustard katz wins the flavor and taste test for me because its very ape in every bite when it comes to juiciness its a draw and you can see how juicy both sandwiches are in my pics one aspect we did like at schwartz s they don t allow you to pile on bs toppings like cheese russian dressing and coleslaw or sauerkraut like katz s great deli is like a great steak its great on its own the only thing on both should be a super light schmear of mustard in a bite that s why its always best to order no mustard so you can add it accordingly on every bite plus it allows you to taste the meat on its own we did like the vinegar based montreal coleslaw vs the mayo based and we both said we could eat that with anything the pickles could be more sour cause it was like eating wet cucumbers in the end both sandwiches are great in their own right and it will come down to preference in fact both places are so a like that when i walked in schwartz i thought i was walking into a smaller katz which was a good thing
  grand opening has been pushed back until likely late november with doors opening to the public saturday november 15th must check this place out when it opens i loved pizza a metro and hope this place will keep the grandeur and majesty of the food and add alcohol and space for not too much more money we ll see otherwise i ll just keep going to pizza a metro
  went to blue agave last night for taco tuesday my girlfriend and i got food poisoning and still have symptoms 24 hours later beware of dollar tacos because taco tuesday will lead to vomit vednesday sever was nice though so i will give it a star i pretty much don t want to ever eat mexican food ever again for the rest of my life
  still amazing we make it a point to stop by this place for our combo pan roast fix whenever we re in town what is not to love about generous portions of seafood succulently cooked in a creamy sauce of tomato paste sherry heavy cream and other spices not to mention the hilariously entertaining staff and the friendliness of the other patrons you ll be seated elbow to elbow with definitely an off strip vegas experience you need to see for yourself
  awesome food service is a little slow but delish the pita bread and hummus was awesome
  thank goodness for yelp reviewers or i would have never found this place i am in heaven fish tacos re fried beans with amazing hot sauce selection yum
  yogis grill is coming soon to the safway center at val vista elliot road can t wait
  nom nom nom in my belly more risotto cakes please i m very happy to have an herb box closer to my casa i was delighted with my first visit to dc ranch but the drive is less and less likely to happen at 4 a guzzle the southbridge location did not disappoint our table on the patio facing the waterfront was relaxing beautiful and perfect for a quiet monday evening out the interior was impressive and the bathrooms a thorough review of the bathroom facilities is always an important part of my dining experience these banos are sahweet our server was one of the best i ve ever had and i come from a serving background very good knowledge and description of the food perfect timing of table visits and a stellar attitude towards our preference for a snail paced meal the best part those damn risotto cakes that i m now dreaming about we tried the pear and gorg pizza as well which was scrumptious and the market salad was so so i cannot wait to continue my way down the list of fresh and delicious items on the menu lovely lovely place
  i have been craving a good burger for a few weeks now and living in surprise there are slim pickins however after a quick yelp search the beau found marleys just 10 minutes away from us who boasted the best burgers in surprise so of course i had to go it was pretty quiet on a thursday night we were seated right away our waiter was nice but service was a tad slow we both ordered burgers my beau had the jalapeno burger while i went for the bbq bacon cheeseburger their beer menu is pretty small mostly domestics nothing too appealing however the rest of their food menu is pretty extensive definitely worth a look next time the burgers came out in about 15 minutes and were very good definitely the best i ve had in surprise it was obvious that the patties were hand crafted and not frozen at all i highly suggest swapping out fries for onion rings they were perfectly crisp btw marley s closes pretty early for a bar and restaurant they close at 8pm so i d def get my butt in there early if you re craving a good burger
  had to eat here with coworkers for lunch today and was incredibly disappointed my 8 caesar salad was probably the tiniest i ve ever had service was slow the entire table was nearly finished before mine arrived and staff was unapologetic i ve had side salads larger than the full salad they served me for lunch overall a miserable experience and i won t be back
  great italian pasta made on site and was fresh and cooked to perfection we will visit here again on our next trip
  seating wait time 15mins sunday afternoon food time after ordering 5mins for appetizers 35 40 min for entrees food quality 5 out of 5 waiter 5 out of 5 me and my girlfriend walked in on a sunday afternoon before our long trip home to california it was our first time there so we had no idea what to expect it was a bit busy and they do not have much room for waiting the wait time to be seated was relatively short for the amount of people there we were able to get our drinks and appetizers really quick after ordering the problem was the entrees taking too long the food was really great for a chain restaurant with the enchiladas being the best i ve had in a long time the waiter was great and was keeping us up to date about our food overall great restaurant with good food but get four stars due to long food wait times and poor waiting area
  what a wonderfully romantic dinner spot it has a beautiful veiw and very good service great place would love to return
  bam emeril is a winner food and service are great we didn t have anything we didn t enjoy
  i have had 2 or 3 previous experiences that i really enjoyed taking out from here obviously why i kept returning my last time was very disappointing not only was my order not spicy at all i ordered it hot but i couldn t even eat it and ended up throwing 20 of food away major bummer really want to give it one more shot because of my previous great experiences with the same dish but also nervous about the inconsistency
  stone brewing arrogant tap appropriation during american craft beer week 2013 do i really need to say more the selection of stone brews at this all day event was dizzying i was very surprised that we were able to find some seats but fortunately we managed without too much hassle our server was really good very friendly and helpful i continue to love this place and recommend it to anyone who loves good beer and to those who could use a little help in their beer selection it was pretty amusing we were there for the stone brewing event last night and at the table next to us this guy orders a corona pretty funny to watch the faces at the tables surrounding him when the server brought it out to him
  1st visit had the lo mein delish 2nd visit had the teriyaki fine if you like salt ick
  stopped by here for their happy hour during a business trip had an hour or two to kill before our flight back so my coworker and i randomly discovered this place pretty cheap drinks during their happy hour around 4 5 they also have pretty big portions for the food on their hh menu as well i was able to try the ahi tuna hummus and pita and bruschetta ahi tuna was a little funky and made me wonder where they even got tuna in arizona but everything else was pretty standard good spot to grab drinks outside and enjoy the weather if its not too hot
  ate here randomly with my family were extremely surprised at the amazing food our server was very nice and attentive she checked on us several times and was very helpful we ordered the artichoke spinach dip and it was hands down the best we have ever had i had the quinoa black bean burger and it was phenomenal i would recommend this restaurant to anyone
  this is one of my favorite places i have ever ate in north carolina hands down tapas and amazing cocktails you won t be disappointed
  just didn t feel like making dinner tonite and wanted something quick yummy and good for me i noticed zoes on my drive home and decided to stop in and check it out the food was pretty good i got the grilled chicken platter with a side of rice i left feeling full but like the good kind not the on my god i m gonna pass out kind and satisfied i gave it 2 stars because it is kinda generic and there are so many hidden gems to keep an eye out for enjoy
  stopped here on a recent vacation to arizona it s one of the places you need to stop at while you re there a huge pipe organ playing all kinds of tunes the pizza was pretty good but it s more about the experience there s two levels so you can sit upstairs and overlook the stage or sit on the ground floor worth a visit if you re in the area
  deep fried twinkies yessiree bob there is such a thing and the okie toby keith s serves them up heart attack optional artery blockage very likely served up with a bunch of whipped cream and gooey strawberries had lunch here with a friend and happy hour once nachos were not good drinks were average but hello fried twinkie you re right up there with mud pie and tiramasu as the dessert of choice skip the alcohol and save your liver
  5 star service from waitress 5 star quality but still a 3 star can t bump it up to 4 and i really want to i was really hyped to come here since i have not been back to japan for 3 years i thought i can finally have authentic japanese food i miss so much i made reservation for monday i figured they are closed on sunday so fish will be extra fresh on monday did the nigiri course with miso soup and extra uni nigiri appritizer bonito was fresh seaweed and cucumber flavor was little off for me nigiri course which chief explain each fish it was truly fresh and was good quality one had the best uni here in us their snapper like fish from japan was amazing ikura had clean flavor okay so whats the 3 stars to me their rice was extra soggy maybe was jut that day also their fish miso soup still had lots of bones they took broth from which fish bones make the best broth but for the price and fanciness they should take out the bones and put a piece of a fish even if it has lil bones can t put all the bone in there nigiri size for omakase was small so rice and fish perfect portion was ruined which is important in sushi restaurants okay so my point is high quality fish if they charge as much as they do can be ordered by anyone and any restaurants only few vendors anyways but kabuto lacks in details japanese edomae sushi should have small details that perfects a sushi bar and kabuto isn t there yet desert anin tofu almond tofu was pretty amazing you should get that if you go there and waitress was sweet attention to detailed and amazing deserving of high tip it was good experience and i do recommend people who have never been to japan or place like this try it you will enjoy it just didn t meet my expectation if anyone ever goto osaka goto sanosa in shinsaibashi that to me is real quality and detail meet together
  out late cruising desired some pasta we just happened by mazzo s don t know how many times we ve cruised by saying we should try this place tonight was the night we walked into a big party large crowd enjoying music and drink at first i thought we would be turned away but we got seated and our service was excellant despite theitr busy party the portions are good size the beet salad was plentiful we re big eaters my husband and i can put it away but the salad and parma pizza we got as apps was generous the pizza was very good love the figs for entree my husband got the spagetti and meatballs two large very moist balls pasta just al dente my choice was chicken riggii peppers pasta chicken in white wine and sweet tomatoes smothered with cheese very good too much for me i got a doggie bag it was a good meal great service and got to take advantage of good music they had for the in house party going on
  average chain not bad not great
  we came in on a sunday night the hostess barely acknowledged us the food was mediocre and way to expensive for the serving size the waitress rachel was the only saving grace for this experience she was kind responsive and personal major downfall my 2 year old daughter was charged for a full entree all she had was some noodles dry no sauce and a plain breast of chicken the cost for her meal 12 75 hardly reasonable the sushi was dry and the size of a nickel the soy sauce was way too salty and took away from the somewhat palatable taste of the food overall not really worth the 50 tab and we didn t even order any drinks just had water reminding me to stay away from the large corporate chains and continue to fill the pockets of small mom and pop businesses
  i went to the place a few weeks after it first opened last year and have kept going back since rebel is a really cool bar lots of beer selections the food menu has changed maybe once or twice since i ve been going assuming they were using a test menu or something either way i love the avocado tempura and the kobe sliders there s always a good crowd at rebel and the bartenders are all pretty friendly especially larry he s awesome rebel is my boyfriend and i s go to place it would be awesome if they had like a trivia night karaoke or something either way rebel is great
  what happened to gameworks i understand they had to make changes after moving from the strip but my expectations were so much higher you walk into the new location and it almost seems empty there is a lot of square footage but not enough games to fill the space i am not a gamer but i do enjoy sports driving and flying games they had a bit of a selection but it seemed like there could ve been so much more my experience here was okay but i don t see myself coming back anytime soon i hope as time goes on gameworks is able to get to something near what the strip location was
  i went here looking for something simple i wanted a small meal but wanted some fries and some quality beef i sat at the bar and i ordered the ginger pear cocktail very refreshing but very tart that it gave me heartburn i love vodka and ginger next cocktail moscow mule hmmm they used a ginger syrup instead of ginger beer hollerrrr love love love great service at the bar they weren t very busy at the bar but the rest of the restaurant seemed a bit full i decided to go with the burger with brie and fries and a side of mayo i decided not to go with the filet because i thought it would be too much food so i think the burger was 25 or 26 and it came with truffle fries and some kind of truffle mayo i believe and the burger had brie and yuzu pickles on it i asked for my burger to be cooked medium rare they brought my side of mayo and had gone to the restaurant next door to get it which i thought was nice the fries came in a small black iron dish with truffles on top not impressed i ate around them i just wanted fries normal fries these fries were short and small i could barely dip them in my mayo and ketchup ugghhh the burger i am a huge fan of pickles nice kosher pickles maybe a little spice to them these were awful didn t taste anything like a pickle the brie i love brie love love love brie but not on this burger the meat was dry i think it was medium rare looked kinda medium the place was kinda dark so i couldn t really tell overall very disappointed with my 25 burger and fries i think i will stick to the cocktail and steak menu next time 4 stars for excellent service and nice ambience this is my second time here and the service is always good
  i like there food and prices they have good portion sizes hubby likes machca with eggs we like going for breakfast most of the time it s take out
  great place to grab a quick bite to eat all pitas are made in front of you and they have a large selection of toppings everything from your normal olives onions green pepper to hummus ranch bbq sauce pineapple sprouts staff is always friendly and there pita s always taste great try the club or buffalo chicken they are my favorites
  breakfast on the weekends lunch dinner football games big portions friendly staff a lot of tv s come on what else do you need oh peanuts yep on the table lol
  the food was ok the bartender made a really good patron margarita the restaurant got really hot and i m not sure if there air conditioning is holding up to the heat if i went back i would just try something else on the menu i always give two tries before i make a decision not to go back service was good and a very beautiful view sitting at the bar live music was a nice added touch
  i would give this more of a 3 5 star rating went here since it was listed on the top 10 buffets in vegas multiple times it was about 35 for lunch here thankfully the line was not awfully long and we got seated right away the decor here could use a serious facelift it feels like a pretty old space with the right decor i think more people would enjoy their dining experience the variety was just ok i guess they did hit on a lot of different types of cuisines but a lot of the dishes were average and not memorable in both presentation and appeal a lot of things i just looked at and passed on because they looked messy some highlights calamari greek salad really tender and tasty carving station prime rib 2 different types of crab snow and king but both super frozen pesto mashed potatoes herbed polenta and chocolate covered strawberries they had spicy tuna hand rolls which were made to order they were ok a little on the spicy end i wish they had more custom sushi roll options service was really good they came back a lot for refills and to clear our plates a decent option if in the area
  we are visiting from colorado and california and picked this restaurant based on its reviews and posted menu it was an excellent choice beautiful patio and although it was very busy we could hear well enough to have a very nice conversation with the couple we were with our waiter was terrific very attentive and helpful in choosing our meal the food was wonderful and beautifully served my husband had the ahi tuna and a caesar salad and said the tuna was the best he s ever tasted the three others had pear salad which was so good and then had the duck breast as our entree it was also excellent our only complaint is the mark up of wine the selection is wonderful we even own some of it so we know the purchase price but most choices were marked up at least by three we ve experienced this at other restaurants in the phoenix area as well so it must be typical just seems as though more would take advantage of an excellent wine list if prices were more reasonable saw many folks ordering wine by the glass all in all we enjoyed the evening very much and will certainly return
  we were referred here by some friends who ate there 3 times in 4 days i could not find on their website how they define their food but it is not your typical mexican restaurant if you are looking for a heavy plate of food smothered in cheese look elsewhere my wife and i have been two weekends in a row and are thoroughly impressed we have had the carne tacos brochetas skewered steak shrimp and chicken chips and salsa ceviche and a side of pintos the wife loved the blended auntie ox and i had a margarita and sampled some of their tequilas in a sipping glass it is pricey but it is very unique and i assume the rent in the red rock does not come cheap we re going back and taking friends
  i was craving steak something fierce and we were staying at aria so hubby and i chose beso for dinner no problems getting a reservation on a sunday night i think we were there around 7 or 7 30pm not many people in there at all maybe us and 5 other tables anyways it s dark and romantical and best of all on the menu is a porterhouse for 2 there s nothing i love more than a juicy porterhouse so hubby and i ordered that along with green beans why bother and au gratin potatoes for sides holy crap first of all the porterhouse was amazing they bring it to you already sliced off the bone which is perfect for when i m inhaling meat and trying not to get my party clothes dirty i didn t eat the green beans but hubby said it was a waste of 8 but the au gratin potatoes omg get them they were hot cheesy potato y and delicious seriously we raved about them and kept waiting for the other to show weakness aka a full stomach so the other could finish them off they are so freaking good service was good and ohhhh those potatoes
  only been there once and the service was sloooooooooooooooooooow maybe everyone was just stoned the food is great though biggest surprise the french toast seriously nice relaxed atmosphere with great music playing at a decent volume to allow conversation good beers on tap
  took my kids there and had an ok experience waitress was ok and made few mistakes on our orders we waited over 40 minutes and seated next to bunch of roudy teenager we ordered sushi and sushi was terrible we took a bite and sent it back teppan sushi was mediocre at best and nothing entertaining we took our kids to bennihana few weeks later and they had much better time bit pricey its ok place if you live close by but sushi i would not recommend at all i hope this helps
  staying at the mgm i decided to grab a late lunch here for i hadn t eaten all day and was starving i sat at the bar and ordered a pizza which was very good however the sevice was subpar at best not something i would expect from a place like this the bartender a cute female took my order refilled my tea after asking me what it was i guess with a whole 6 people at the bar its hard to remember what everyone is drinking and that was the only interaction the entire hour i was there not once did anyone check on me to ask how the food was or if i needed anything i know this sounds critical but when you are paying 25 for a pizza at lunch i dont think its too much to ask if everything is good and if i needed anything some parmesean cheese would have been nice but hey i ate the pizza anyway bottom line sit at a table if you are eating here for it looked like ths servers were very attentive
  first off nothing gourmet going on here at all its basically subway with free delivery and they have to deliver it for free or there is no way in hell you would bother with the place it s cheap generic flavorless food
  so far the food is good as far as jafar behind the counter i was apprehensive at first it turns out he really knows what he is doing from marinating flavors and using an ice smoker for smoked lobster and crab i want to come back and try that and give a different review which means the makeral was decent the octopus and roe were hefty portions and the not chewy they also have the elusive asahi black best beer to have with sushi my complaints are the edamame if you like it melted then try it however i like mine very raw or aldente it was terrible although the taste of the garlic was still great lastly the bathroom was dusty dust that fake plant
  i live close by to ginza but i had not gotten the chance to try it yet i ordered take out was happy that they offered the maki for 2 special for take out the special is a great deal 2 special rolls 2 regular rolls and 2 soups or salads for 38 i m not sure that i will ever find outstanding sushi anywhere in pittsburgh but this was pretty good you get a lot of food for the price and the quality was good i will be back
  all the food i tried was disappointing and flavorless i ordered the dish they are known for the unfried chicken and the chicken penne because the unfried chicken is placed on top of the cashew cream it was slightly soggy the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked the chicken penne was even more bland than the unfried chicken the presentation was sloppy and unappetizing i was surprised the sauce was advertised as a cream sauce because it was watery the vegetables were all different sizes which makes me question the knife skills of the prep cook the pasta was so over cooked that i had trouble picking it up with my fork overall the food here is poorly executed and under seasoned
  c shack a new venture by the owners of port of siam originally in this location now moved closer into town is a fresh look at a seafood restaurant in newhaven sure it utilises stereotypes oh i do like to be beside the seaside white and blue decor and it s name alone is a natty little play on words sadly no crab though when we visited in more than one way but we enjoyed our visit there last night and enjoyed it more in all honesty than our visit to it s predecessor which hadn t delivered on a tempting promise c shack promises to serve up whatever is brought into dock along with some more staple offerings we tried out the isle of mull crab spring rolls the home made sweet chilli dip was the outright winner on this plate and vietnamese salmon with orange flavours drowned out by some dried onion but the salmon itself was fresh and tender and was still tasty we followed this up with the surf turf burger burger with a side of prawns and a portion of skinny fries and the special bream with tomatoes and samphire the burger was a winner a solid pice of beef although skinny fries are forgettable at best the bream for me was a little on the disappointing side overloaded with butter nay drowned and the tomatoes cherry roasted and placed on top for me the flavours were too separate and as a dish didn t gel together super well but the fish itself was beautifully cooked and i ll have samphire any day of the week overall c shack is a a newbie some of it s dishes could do with a little improvement but it has good ownership running it and overall it s a welcome addition to the neighbourhood and i m sure we will be back again
  montreal fantastic meal made to seem effortless by the staff an kitchen escargot wine and margret de canard was excellent start to finish
  food 4 5 service 4 5 ambience 5 5 our favourite dining experience whilst in edinburgh for the holiday it wasn t the best food but it was decent traditional faire such as meat pies haggis blood sausages etc are done well there are other michelin star worthy restaurants we ate at in edinburgh but nothing beat the history or atmosphere of this place situated in old town edinburgh right next to the castle this was apparently part of the jail barracks centuries ago rumours abound of haunted spirits that were tortured in these gallows still roam this restaurant and surrounding buildings of the castle the inside of the restaurant was very small romantic and quaint most doors in the uk are tiny but this place reminded me of entering a hobbit s home i thought it was way too hot inside despite it being below freezing and windy outside it was hard to remove all my layers of clothing with such tight quarters if you only had one night in edinburgh for the first time i d highly recommend going here
  tried tonkatsu kiyoshi last night it was recommended to us by our sister in law when we first arrived the place was packed both the bar seats and tables were full there was one group of 4 waiting for a table ahead of us but we were able to squeeze into a seat at the bar the decor and atmosphere of the tiny restaurant did not seem thought out too well i think the main turn off was how incredibly bright the place was i think if there s one major detail to dining out it s good lighting the waitress was handling all the checks at the bar and there was really no separation between the back counter and the bar so that was a little odd too we could see the employees personal things piled on a chair in front along with what looked like a bug zapper weird there was also a basket of pens and crap on the bar too which i think was a little distracting at first we ordered the edamame and beef tataki to start the beef tataki was served with shredded onions and citrus ponzu that i mixed with grated daikon i really enjoyed that so good for dinner i ordered the tonkatsu and shrimp combo which is a pretty good deal considering it comes with miso rice shredded cabbage salad and pickled onions it s a good size portion as well you mixed your own katsu sauce too at the table which is basically just grinding sesame seeds then poring in tonkatsu sauce the shrimp was huge too like prawn size and they lay the fried katsu meats on a wire rack to keep it crispy which is always a good thing i thought my meal was delicious and worth the 16 that it cost my bf orders the katsu curry which came with miso rice curry and katsu he devoured his dish so it must have been tasty for dessert we got the green tea cheesecake which was good too but a lot of japanese restaurants carry that as a dessert item i was happy with the meal just wish they could create a better ambiance by fixing that damn lighting
  fresh fish and great happy hour specials worth the drive to check out as it s across town from me so requires special planning the firecracker roll is a favorite but everything is executed very well tostadas tako is slightly spicy salmon is delicious hamachi was on the plain side tuna poke was the best 1 each hh regularly 2 ea hydrobib black cod delicate but flavorful loved the soft texture of the fish contrasting with the fresh crunch of the lettuce firecracker roll a favorite roll packs a nice punch of heat with spicy tuna and jalapeno cools it down with a minimal amount of cream cheese and great texture and flavor of sweet onion unique salmon avocado roll simple and delicious cajun albacore sashimi bf s favorite good sized portion with a lot of sauce served on a bed of crunchy radish ika geso tasty surprise a bar food take on fried squid with a dust of spice served with a curry mustard sauce the sauce makes it baked mussels large tender and saucy added the server s recommendation yellowtail sashimi their signature dish it was good with generous slices of fish and light but flavorful garlic ponzu but not something i haven t had elsewhere ultimately i came here due to the yonaka comparisons and was pleased with the fish quality and the great flavors but feel the menu is mostly great quality versions of common sushi staples would love to see them add some more unique or inventive dishes like the ika gesso will be back for the firecracker roll would love to meet chef john on my next visit
  longhorn steakhouse 1434 s alma school road mesa arizona 85210 preface i don t usually like to evaluate chain restaurants but with more and more people eating at them it seemed proper to evaluate this one this is part of the darden chain which also includes olive garden etc i arrived at 6 15 and though told it was a 10 minute wait i was seated in 3 minutes my waiter brought a drink and warm bread quickly and handed me the menu as well as explained the specials of the night the waiter tim was extremely attentive and honest when asked about items on the menu how refreshing i was originally going to get the rib eye steak but tim suggested that i get the larger rib steak on the bone he wasn t pushy but offered good reasons to get it an excellent job of up selling for a restaurant i also ordered a baked potato with lots of butter and a salad with honey mustard dressing of the bread i can only say it was warm i didn t care for the flavor of it and it almost seemed to be under baked and lacking in flavor the salad was a nice portion with a good dressing though i didn t care for the diced tomato on it diced tomato is a way of a restaurant saving money by not using premium tomatoes not a good idea in due course my steak appeared i had ordered it rare and it came medium my waiter immediately took it back apologized and had a new one cooked properly with a new baked potato in minutes great service the steak was perfectly cooked this time with perhaps a touch too much of seasoning but that is an individual preference the potato was properly presented with lots of butter as i had asked my biggest criticism is the same one i have in many steak houses i hate being given oversized knives with serrated edges if the steak is as tender as steak houses claim a sharp plain edged knife will easily do the job without tearing up the meat my steak had a bit of silver skin still on it which should have been removed by the butcher my waiter kept checking up to make sure my drink was full and i had everything i wanted i was quite full and my waiter promptly brought a take home box and even brought a small cruet to put some horse radish sauce in i like horse radish on more than just prime rib most places make a big deal out of my ordering it but my waiter didn t bat an eye and even brought extra even though i was full i wanted to try dessert while many of the desserts are brought in from the outside i was told that the caramel apple goldrush was made in house my only comment about it would be to describe it as comfort food warm gooey comforting apples in a rich sauce with lots of cinnamon and caramel sauce topped with a very smooth vanilla ice cream slowly melting over it i could have made a meal just out of this dessert it s a real winner i have eaten in some of the top restaurants of the world from those of the iron chef s to the flagship of mortons in hong kong to elements in paradise valley and the service i had tonight was right up there if not better than any of them service can make or break a meal and service was absolutely tops tonight kudo s to tim my waiter and i hope my tip showed him just how much i appreciated him 3 1 2 stars for the food and an extra 1 2 star for service and cleanliness for a total of 4 stars i will definitely evaluate this restaurant again in the future to see if the service stays up to standard
  friendliest employees ever and those hamburgers are fantastic food quality is what i d expect at a good sit down restaurant
  when i got here it was extremly busy and the wait was 30 min or i could just sit at the bar with no wait i sat at the bar of course the unlimited soup and breadsticks are awesome although the thing that had gotten to me was the service there were two bartenders taking peoples orders drink orders one was very good and the other just dropped the ball on every level you already know which one i had gotten thankfully the awesome bartender picked up the slack and i went with him for the rest of the night and it definitely saved the experience food was okay it wasn t as good as i remembered i got some eggplant pasta and it was meh nothing particularly stood out awesome bartender is awesome and just a chill dude in general that defnitely knew how to provide a good experience which bumped this up to 3 stars
  i love there fresh produce and great selection of asian stuff
  we just moved to the glendale area and were looking for somewhere other than the regulars to deliver hubby found this place on here and they were friendly while ordering we went with the basic pizza wings combo the pizza has a bread like crust which isn t my favorite but it was really tasty nothing against them it s a personal preference i do like that they don t drown their pizza in sauce the cheese was really good too but omg the wings i fell in love with them too bad i had to share the order with hubby or i would ve eaten all dozen of them lol we got the honey bbq sauce and it was amazing the wings are huge too just so good can y all tell that i really loved those wings
  pretty darn good teriyaki bowls and at a cheap price miso soup was 99 cents and pretty good with added soy sauce i will be back to try other items 2 happy hour chicken bowls 3 5 pm cant beat that
  one of my favorite italian restaurants the grandma s square is amazing as well as the cesar salad and their meatballs are delicious they are very nice and friendly and nice atmosphere
  you are better off eating on the premises lots of changes in ownership and i can show you pictures of burned delivered pizzas and being blamed for the whole thing at you won risks but taste is good
  went to island flavor for lunch food was great
  wanted a couple of slices of pizza for lunch so i thought i would give this little place a try could have definately been better tried to order a couple of slices of mama s special nope didn t have any okay let try something simple pepperoni be ready in 10 minutes are you kidding me how about cheese out okay what do you have that is ready an italian sausage calzone i will take it and actually it was pretty good and to be honest if i had originally gone here for a calzone it may even got another star nothing special here but it is worth a try i will probably be back and hopefully they will have some pizza to taste otherwise i will probably only stop when i want my lunch to be a surprise
  shrimp cocktail is a must spicy with a hint of sweet excellent service the price is a little high until you see the portions spicy salsa with chips is served after you order your drinks great margaritas and friendly staff
  great deals and okay pizza also got my order wrong when they came by i didn t mind that much also didn t get chocolate cake and one of the pizzas did not have cheese on tomato sauce and meatballs
  i think you need to take off a star for all vegas reviews this place was hyped up on yelp and in vegas i like my sushi but this place is wayyyy overrated as far as food taste and quality ambiance and service was ok
  being a frequent diner at this great establishment great happy hour specials i generally know what to expect the top shelf management team is always there to greet you check in and maintain a high level of quality our waiter chad however must have missed the dominick s memo our family table specifically requested to be upstairs of 9 folks were taken care of by chad in a manner more suited for someone who wished he was anywhere but delivering the fine memorable dining experience i ve come to expect it was almost as if he was tuned out and disinterested the entire evening no emphasis on making it a pleasant dining experience for anyone in our party that s for sure it was too bad that my family had an incredible meal that was left unnecessarily bitter by the apathetic service of one waiter dominick s and my family deserved better
  i have eaten here many times some of the dishes are amazing others are good i find it hard to remember what i have had to really try everything absolutly recomend back for the humus and the picnic salid both fantastic
  love this place when i m in vegas again this is the place for some brazilian peruvian and japanese food
  a while back we used to like memphis bbq until we had the bbq at famous dave s we ve been to the other location at blue diamond several times we came here on sunday our 1st visit to this location to cash in on a birthday coupon promotion buy one entree get one free join the club online we requested a booth there is a ton of seating here several dining rooms and there is ample parking as well there was a pretty good lunch crowd here also family friendly this location used to be a steakhouse but the chain failed and closed up shop all tables come equipped with salt pepper ketchup a roll of paper towel some menus and the five signature sauces rich and sassy my favorite devil s spit very hot georgia mustard vinegar based sweet and zesty another good one and texas pit tomato based we forgot which ones we liked so we sampled them all on the back of the menu there is a set of daily early bird specials so that s what we ordered the two meat special that came with one side and a corn bread muffin and we opted for an extra side for 2 29 after our drinks came we got a small salted and seasoned freshly made chips i chose the brisket and the roasted chicken while my husband got the chopped pork and brisket said that there was some fatty pieces and that the skin made it crunchy so he will not order this again there was very little fat on the brisket which was a good thing i always cut the fat off everything several slices with some sauce topped a single slice of soft white bread i took a bite but didn t finish it the chicken breast and wing was really good moist not overdone though i didn t finish it for my sides i chose the mac cheese hint of jalapenos and the fries thick skin on crisp the mac cheese was excellent i liked the fries too not greasy and mushy i gave some fries to my husband my husband got the mac cheese and coleslaw i took my corn muffin home to eat later we d been craving bbq and this really hit the spot service was really good both our drinks and food came out pretty quickly our server came to check on us several times and gave us refills without us asking love that he was also helpful when it came to the menu we had questions on the heat of the mac cheese my husband can take a hint but not much we want to come back soon for the advertised special the que for two 19 99 such a great value
  i have such mixed feelings about this place i would have given it 4 stars had the service not been so awful our waiter was too hip to be bothered to do his job properly um hello you re a waiter and acted as though he was annoyed to wait on us it seemed we were always waiting for something napkins water the bill on the upside we sat outside and this place has an awesome patio i ordered the picnic chicken and switched out the pumpernickel bread for wheat it was really good reasonably priced and came with a mound of fruit overall not a bad experience i would probably try it again and hope for a different waiter
  gotta love the vibe at cartel before i even get to the coffee the place itself deserves recognition local art some for sale covers the walls and is always changing the music is always spot on the couches are comfy and when you leave your clothes smell like a nice dark roast for the rest of the day i suppose some may not like this but i rather enjoy it as for the coffee prepare to get your buzz on i always get a hell of a pick me up from my go to cartel americano exceptional flavor fresh and just as good iced as it is hot they rarely disappoint my only complaint is the cost but considering their support of local art and business i can deal with the additional charge
  this place is not good i am sorry but the food is just blah did ppl actually eat here before giving it 5stars
  only giving four stars as i have never been to the actual location only eaten takeout pizza that a friend picked up but the pizza was excellent we got the ham pineapple and jalapeno thin crust pizza this has to be the best pizza in mesa
  green chilli on fry bread so tasty
  i was happy with my special sushi lunch soup house salad 4 pcs of nigiri and crunchy california roll for 10 50 yes i do love california roll i will be back to try their ramen noodles
  because i frequent the consignment store next door i remembered lovingly the days of the salami goat cheese sandwich since this is no longer the work hood it still does not disappoint and because i m being more proactive about healthier eats this time i ordered the chicken pesto sandwich seriously just as good with roasted peppers roast chicken pesto and all warm and fresh it s a lot of sandwich so for me its two meals easy two days worth of happy food i m all in
  had to review this place again been going here very often and it s an awesome choice to make for lunch off campus i love their lunch speicals and they have a wide range of options i have had very good experiences here i would very much recommend
  planned my sons 5th birthday party here my fault for doing it on a saturday the place is packed total insanity very very loud don t expect to be carrying on any conversations with the other parents kids running everywhere kids had fun i mean it s chuck e cheese so i wasn t expecting perfection my beef is with the pricing kids cost 12 99 each for the party package which is no biggie and you can order extra pizzas for parents at 16 a pop but you also have to buy individual drinks for the adults too i don t know about you but i had about 4 times the amount of adults to kids and at 2 a drink that was almost 100 more they leave that part out until you get there and no you can t bring in bottled water or anything this place is expensive for a kids party but everyone has to do it at least once so save up did like that they number you and your child with a stamp at the door so when you leave they make sure you have the right child selma our party hostess was great very helpful and one of the few teenagers working there that wasn t totally hating life
  the staff was very friendly and they are the reason i will return there was an allergy issue and the staff handled it very well they were kind and kept apologizing but it really was our fault for not reading all of the ingredients closely to see one was an allergen the prices are pretty high but this is a health menu restaurant the indoor sitting area seemed uncomfortable and multiple two seated tables the outdoors seating was beautiful and welcoming it was a beautiful day so that just added to the attraction the plates arrived with a large serving of food and the dishes were tasty it was not a place for a wow factor but great service i enjoyed the chicken quinoa salad and my friend had the fresh fruit salad
  the rave reviews i d heard for casbah were so over the top i thought it would be impossible to live up to casbah has exceeded it s sky high expectations and made me a believer we got the brunch and while the 24 pre fix menu isn t cheap it actually felt like a steal because the ambiance decor friendly attentive staff and generous portions of delicious inventive food were all so fantastic the brunch pre fix included your choice of breakfast cocktails appetizer entree and amazing still steaming home made muffins and mint chocolate scones i m anything but a light eater and there was so much that i still had to take half my meal home we all got different things and there wasn t a single bite of anything that we didn t love i particularly recommend the arugula salad salmon and dill appetizer and the scallop and grits entree though you really can t go wrong the decor and music was just as unique artistic and beautiful as the rest of the big burrito hot spots we ate in the basement with a beautiful fully stocked glass wine cellar under lit stone tile walls and wooden ceiling trim casbah isn t cheap but i d still consider it once of the best values in the city because you get so much for your money i d trust casbah to celebrate any special event with a flawless dining experience
  this is one of my favorite places to grab dinner and drinks with friends but only when i have a lot of time on my hands the food is good and the prices are on the high side of fair the problem is the service really slow and with an attitude no matter when you go or who your server bartender is they seem unable to handle a crowd of more than about 3 tables without the staff having a melt down i go because i like the food they have a good beer list and the place is quiet enough that you can actually talk to the people you re with it s a really nice place to kill a few hours and catch up with old friends
  place smelled like smoke was very dirty even though there was only 3 seated tables a long wait to be seated and pay ticket only ate two bites of my omelet and found a chunk of wood the omelet tasted like a smokers mouth my coffee jar was cold and stale 10 stars
  i recently discovered this place because of a good friend of mine the food tastes so fresh and it is vegetarian and vegan friendly the menu makes all the items sound so enticing and everything i have tried to date has been delicious and satisfying my only issue is the location and hours of operation if it were not for my friend i would ve never found this place and i do wish they were open past 4 pm or open up another location more convenient for those of us who do not work in uptown in banking other then that the food and service were great it s a place worth trying if you can to uptown during lunchtime
  limited menu but very good quality spice levels are a bit higher than most it s all cash service was fair
  conflicted on this review but i am going to stick to my guns i am a huge fan of papago beers and love that they have 25 30 on top plus 7682763 beers not actual number in bottles that you can drink there or take home it is extremely loud inside which some nights can be tolerable but if you get a table of guys shouting at each other it can be distracting if you are looking to hang with friends my meh review comes from the food their menu has a lot of variety and everyone loves pizza right i ordered the pretzel which itself was amazing just the right amount of chewy and fluffy the cheese sauce it came with did nothing for the dish i also ordered the california blt salad and here is where more disappointment came in i ordered the 1 2 size which was a huge portion but it really did disappoint the avocado slices on the salad were not ripe and were rock hard the diced chicken was so bland and dry it tasted like it had been boiled the worst part was the bacon it was clearly the kind of pre cooked thin sliced bacon you can buy in the store the whole thing was pretty half assed with ingredients that aren t that difficult to make over all i wanted to give 5 stars but the place gets 5 stars for beer 3 for ambiance because of how loud it gets and a solid 1 on the food i know it is a brewery and i should expect much in regards to food but come on it s not that hard
  just ran in to carry out some pad see ew wow it was so delish can t wait to go back
  i want to give this dump a big fat 0 my mother and i went this past weekend very hopeful that the food would be good based on the fact they won best in madison how on earth did this place win any award for great food and service is beyond me the menu was extremely old small and the coffee was pure water i order the walleye hash browns toast and eggs breakfast my mother order biscuits and gravy my toast was cold hash browns had no tastes over easy eggs were not cooked fully and fish was very small in size mothers gravy was too salty and a thick bunch of sop the menu had no coordination biscuit gravy and hash browns that is nothing but starch with that aside not only that but the server was horrible i felt like she ignored my mother and i the entire time i understand they were kinda busy fine we can be patient however she refilled coffees at her other tables and stopped by to tell the customers their food was being made after waiting for so long we did not receive such treatment she passed our table several times and never once asked us how was the food or why our orders were taking so long not once she was a horrible waitress neither my mother or i could finish our food i took possibly 4 bites and was done we spent less time eating then we did waiting and ordering waitress continued to ignore us so we got up and just walked over to pay i told the cashier the food was horrible and i wouldn t be back she then stated to us that normally the food is good and she wasn t sure why it was taking the kitchen so long and were getting orders wrong but here is the killer she then leans over and says i hate our kitchen staff we need new ones what kind of place does that you do no throw your co workers under the bus to customers i was beyond flabbergasted just a horrible business not friendly and food is beyond pathetic do not go here i have no idea who in their right mind would vote them as best in madison or give it 5 stars unless you do not have taste buds if you want great food coffee and service go to the original pancake house in monona
  best bbq brisket ever just went there for lunch and it was awesome as always fast friendly service reasonable prices excellent brisket and mac n cheese ohhh and those lil donut things they give you after your meal soooo good can t wait to go back
  after finishing up at bingo with some fellow yelpers we headed over to yonaka for their reverse happy hour they were actually pretty busy for the 3 or so hours we were there and rightfully so this was our first time here and thankfully got some great advice from nelson q on what to order per his suggestions we started off with the crispy brussel sprouts and avocado nigiri he was dead on and we absolutely loved both i believe this was the first time i ve ever purposely ordered brussel sprouts but if every restaurant served them like this i d get them all the time it s packed with flavor and the mint adds a slightly refreshing feel to it the description mentions lemon chili and while the lemon was definitely there i didn t really get any type of chili don t get me wrong these things are absolutely delicious and addicting but i think they could benefit from a bit more heat and a touch more salt as well the second suggestion was for the avocado nigiri and it was even more impressive then the brussel sprouts we liked them so much that we ended up ordering about 8 pieces on top of the other food we got they are small but with a happy hour price of just 1 they re a steal there s so much flavor in these things you get a little sweetness with just the right amount of saltiness and the rice is cooked perfectly it may look and sound like a simple item but if you come here you can t leave without trying one or 4 we also ordered some tea brined ribs and i got a lipa roll for myself since the wife doesn t do seafood the ribs were super tender and tasty but too sweet for my taste i loved the lipa roll and can t wait to go back for some other rolls then to finish off we had what i believe was a version of their kanmi once again just bursting with flavor and while there was much more there it was really like a bananas foster on steroids to me so so good yonaka not only offers great food but some of the best service i ve ever received every single employee who came to our table was super friendly and made sure we were taken care off had full drinks etc we also had the pleasure of having jax come to our table several times she was enthusiastic friendly and i loved how she and the other servers explain the dishes to you it was an amazing dining experience and i m itching to go back already
  i love the fairly new rooftop patio here just awesome my only complaint is that you cannot get food service there i will say the bartenders were very accommodating and friendly we went downstairs after about a 10 minute wait to get a table for 6 15 minutes later no one even greeted us i asked a nearby server if she was ours and she replied no i then asked if she would get the server who was ours 10 minutes later still nothing so i went back to the hostess who about 10 minutes later sent over that original server who claimed we weren t hers if they were really busy i might have understood but we watched our server flirt with several guys at the bar and then stand around and chit chat at the hostess station after i explained to her that we would be leaving she just lamely said oh sorry we went over to jacks where the service was fantastic i think management really needs to work on giving great service because they missed out on 6 dinners and several drinks not to mention i may think twice about going there on game day due to poor service
  the food is excellent but the prices are just nuts i could easily justify a 3 star rating based on the prices but since most of the restaurants in the center of the strip are similarly overpriced i m deducting less than i otherwise might fyi i don t think their online menu is updated with current prices as of this writing but my memory could be off but there are several items i see for which i remember the price being a dollar or two higher anyhow i seem to end up here every trip to vegas so i must like it the nachos are massive the ultimate quesadilla may well be the best quesadilla i ve ever had and better be at 21 and the steak burrito is a winner don t be afraid to share dishes as they are pretty much all big i m a big eater and after starting with chips and guoc i only ate 1 2 my ultimate quesadilla service is friendly and prompt and they clearly have ahem aesthetic requirements for their servers
  dominic s is a nice little place to duck into and grab a meal before a game at pnc park and believe me the sandwiches and beer here will be a lot cheaper than what you find at the stadium from my time here they may even be better for you not by much of course but the food here did not upset my stomach which is something stadium food is always guilty of so that s a good sign of which has better quality food options in my eyes while i wasn t here very long i thought they had some interesting looking menu options to consider most of which were deli or bar food sandwiches that are perfect for game days i ended up getting a chicken sandwich and water and got what i expected a very big greasy but yummy sandwich with the right amount of additional toppings cheeses and sauces as someone else mentioned they use boar head s meat here and it s a nice ingredient that helps bump this place up from being an ordinary sandwich shop of course i guess the bar also makes sure this is more than an ordinary sandwich job i didn t drink while here because it was 90 degrees outside and i wanted water more than beer but from what i saw they have a very impressive selection that won t disappoint i want to add that they actually had very nice service while i was there a nice young man brought my food and even picked up the trash as soon as i was done he was very observant and attentive which really stood out in my mind because i truly expected that i d have to pick up my food and then throw the little basket it came in out myself given the casual setting that dominic s has kudos to them for going above and beyond i d love to come back and eat here again if i have the chance
  horrible service sooooooo slow we sat out on the patio and all the tables were full with only 3 waiters we waited for the server to come take our order for like 10 mins after we sat then 30 mins for our food my dad ordered a drink and the drink took about 15 mins to get to him when there is a bar right next to the patio when we got our food it was a little cold like it was sitting in the kitchen ready to be served for a while the server was nice and very tentative but i feel that it is under staffed also there was only 1 buss boy cleaning tables serving drinks this has been an issue every time we go breakfast lunch or dinner the food is good with good prices but the service is very slow
  it is a fast foods place actually i don t like american foods and burger at all but their lemon pie is my favorite one i always go there for lemon pie hope they will give more different kinds of pie later
  yum garbanzo appetizer is a must the lamb was amazing and cooked perfectly the fish w quinoa wow we ordered the leek appetizer based on it being named one of the top dishes in the country honestly we didn t understand the appeal unique yes and the leeks themselves were flavorful but the cheese and bread crumbs on top seemed incongrous with the other flavors glad we tried it but not a fave nice wine list and the staff was friendly and helpful
  stopped into this place while looking for a unique place for dinner on state street the atmosphere was very quiet and we enjoyed people watching from the big picture window i had a bowl of beef soup with spinach carrots daikon and hand pulled noodles the broth was fantastic very rich and smooth my companions had dumpling soup and a vegetable tofu dish and had nothing but good things to say the prices were ungodly cheap for the amount of food we didn t try appetizers but easily could have and still been coming out under 15 a person i d definitely go back i d like to try the yak meat
  terrible service what a waste to spend and time to come here for lunch i called my order in an hour prior to pick up had to wait 15 min for it and then it was made wrong thankfully i work next door so i was able to bring it back over to be fixed however upon my return no one apologized for the error or inconvenience of having to come back cleary their team needs a lesson in what customer service is i would give them zero stars if that was an option
  who ever heard of putting mushrooms in mac and cheese they did and it works my mushroom hating husband finished his entire side of it this was a first time for me with eating chicken and waffles together and it was wonderful their waffles are really good with a hint of vanilla and the chicken is fried perfectly they also make the best sweet tea i ve had in arizona as close to north carolina s as i ve had in the southwest get the betty boop you can t go wrong
  although the server carlos was extremely polite and friendly his service left much to desire he got 2 of our 4 orders incorrect the food was just okay lot s of better places to have a mexican food dinner in vegas
  my experience at la piccola cucina was great dining in this cute little house turned restaurant was charming and the food was tasty too for only 12 95 i was able to pick out one meat and two sides after much debate i picked a steak butternut squash and couscous and i enjoyed every bite my friends and i stayed a while talking and ended up in a conversation with the owner who proved to be very passionate about food and food history it was a fun experience and i d love to go again
  pretty much empty on a saturday night around 8 30 but i ll take a break from the crazy crowds of las vegas edit 4 1 13 it s closed down so now we know why we got a booth against the window with fantastic views of the strip didn t want to fill up too much so we opted for a few appetizers and cocktails we got the doritos mac and cheese not too creamy but good enough and the doritos added a nice touch the pulled pork egg rolls amazing philly cheesesteak dumplings amazinger for 4 people that were slightly hungry it was a perfect portion to drink i had a skittles martini just because it sounded interesting it tasted just like skittles super sweet and a bit on the strong side give this place a shot
  garcia s is neither mexican nor food anyone wanting authentic mexican needs to stay away from this and other chain restaurants here in az you can pretty much throw a rock in any direction and hit a good family owned and operated mexican place that s to die for stay away from the chains a hint if it s got orange cheese all over the place it ain t real mexican
  so i ate here for the first time after reading all the rave reviews first thing i gotta get off my chest is that the ice water needs to be improved tasted like crappy tap water with a slice of lime come on spend a ill and get a filtered water system pho chandler i had the pho dac biet or the p1 i think it was come on people learn to say it the way it s meant anyway i m a broth guy and on a scale of 1 10 the soup was a 7 i like mine more beefy and it was rather mild the noodles were good and i rate them a 9 lil chewy and sticky the way rice noodles should be i had lots of meat even after all the noodles were down in my tummy which can be a rare thing nowadays anyway i ll be back to try more stuff on the menu hope you fix the water by then
  very cool place great atmosphere the drinks are great and the service was really good as well they don t skimp on the boba which was a huge plus they had a few party games like jenga and simon says which made this place above the rest my only complaint it that our table needed to be wiped down
  had heard rave reviews about meat potatoes so decided to give it a try we went in on a tuesday night without reservations while there seemed to be a few open tables we were told it was an hour wait if we didn t have reservations but fortunately there were three open spots at the bar went with two colleagues food wise both selection and quality i d say it was very good worth visiting service on the other hand was slow it took awhile for the bartender to take our order and it was a bad sign when he returned to ask us for it again and still didn t get it right but to his credit they comped the dish that he forgot and brought out late some of the dishes the mac cheese with chorizon and pulled pork was good though i think butcher and the rye does it much better the mushroom risotto was also tasty as a side note either of these small plates is a meal by itself the fried brussel sprouts were amazing a must the fried tater tots are french fries and a very generous portion we were expecting tater tots so just want to make sure i mention it s really fries and again a lot of fries one colleague ordered a barbecue porkchop which was bigger than him but he said it was good though hard to finish after sharing the brussel sprouts and fries my other colleague ordered a caesar salad which looked very unique it had a fried egg calamari and i think pork belly overall good will likely be back though would give butcher and the rye the edge after a first visit to each
  overpriced and tasteless do not waste your money the main dishes here had no taste i think the chef was asleep my family was totally disappointed by far the worst meal we had in vegas i would have enjoyed burger king
  i found this place about 3 years ago when i moved here from ny i come here at least once a week the food is great it s authentic and is consistent being from ny where the food is great i actually like this place better than many in ny the place is clean the people are friendly i will always continue to go here
  if you re looking for a white tablecloth fancy french restaurant this is not your place it has the ambiance of a loud canadian lodge from the late 80 s to early 90 s and is located below street grade read this as basement the food and the service was good and interesting although a little pricy
  i have been to edinburgh a few times and every time i come here i go to mariachis i love the welcoming atmosphere and the food is amazing i have never had a bad experience and if i had seen the reviews before going i would honestly never try it but i m glad that i have been i m going tomorrow night for the second time in a week it truly is really good
  so i ve never been to the pink s in la i m not a big fan of hot dogs so waiting in line for an hour does not sound enticing at all no lines at the one in vegas that and not wanting to eat two hours at a buffet led us to pink s located right next to the miracle mile planet hollywood this place only has outdoor seating under giant umbrellas it would have been nicer if it wasn t 100 degrees that day but i digress 17 30 gets you a spicy mojave and a planet hollywood http www yelp com biz_photos uqb9ks7lzesghltmuunmea select ku m_3hod0dxaty6 8yqnq warning the spicy mojave is not for the weak those jalapenos can kick your taste buds in the butt
  that was the best chile relleno plate i have ever had cam with a beef and cheese with green chili sauce all over it has become the new standard for all chile rellenos the only problem is that now i don t really care for them anywhere else
  great burger will leave you wanting more i wish they came out with a burger twice the size i d pay extra
  we wanted a place to go watch the hornets game and have dinner the bartender was watching something else and had no problem changing the channel for us we sat at the bar and shared crab puppies as an appetizer they were so tasty and definitely a new favorite of mkne i ordered their soup of the day minestrone it was more of a southwest chili soup and i m thinking they got the bowls mixed up that doesn t take away from how good it was but no way that was minestrone soup for my entre i ordered a shrimp salad with a side of honey mustard pinky s had a fun and hip environment with lots of signs art and old school games around they have healthy food and fried food all in one
  i ate at the thai cuisine resturant on 2 26 2013 it sets on the nw corner of nellis and bonanza i arrived during lunch and there were several people eating but there was ample seating to chose from the place was clean and the service was prompt i was brought a menu immediately and ordered a lunch special garlic chicken with a spicy level of 7 i noticed a buffet type food cart and asked what it was and without answering she motioned for me to the cart there were spring rolls and soup that you could help yourself to i took 2 spring rolls and a bowl of what looked like soup with chicken and thai vegtables both were good the soup a little mild but good i noticed that a customer had returned to the cart and took 4 or 5 spring rolls and not knowing if it was allowed i returned and got 2 more spring rolls when my order arrived i don t have any experience with thai food and would not know how to compare this resturant to others but the food i ordered was good and although i ordered it to be a 7 on the spicy scale i could have ordered an 8 or possibly a 9 i would not drive a long distance to eat at this resturant but if i was in the area i d eat there again
  i have a love hate relationship with tacos mexico i know i could have way better tacos elsewhere but it s like a bad relationship i keep on going back because i need tacos in my life prices have gone up gone are the days when you could order a taco for 1 19 now a mediocre taco will cost you 1 69 this tacos mexico is located in a shady downtown neighborhood i once had a bum stare at me while eating it made for a very uncomfortable situation the service here is just okay it s a hit and miss today s cashier was extremely rude she slammed the drive thru window as soon as the bag touched my hand she was not friendly she seemed miserable on the plus they finally got an english speaking cashier thick accent but that s a step towards the right direction they only used to have non english speaking cashiers the food is okay tacos are mediocre like i mentioned before i ve never ordered anything else here before they do have a taco special three tacos with beans rice and chips for 5 and some change it s worth ordering if you re paying with cash if you re paying with a debit credit card then you ll be charged an additional dollar the beans are the best here they top them off with cheese the meat is too dry and the rice has no flavor drive thru needs to improve wait time is about 20 minutes and they have no prices listed on their drive through menu they have no voice box and you have to order at the drive thru window for the price i could definitely go somewhere else with far better service and food but they re just so close to work that i keep running back to them uugh
  when with my wife for lunch alambre plate is deliciuos service is magnificent and very clean keep up the good work
  at first there were the loooong lines for dinner and then the 50 price of admission i must admit i was skeptical on how good a buffet could be that all changed once we were walked to our table and give a quick tour of the stations by our hostest my eyes lit up like i was in buffet heaven once i started to visit each station and loaded up on some food i was impressed on the selections of each station peking duck and chinese roast pork at the chinese station 6 different type rolls at the sushi station chilled snow crab legs on the seafood station and hot just boiled snow crab legs on another station a station just for cold cuts and sliced meats a carver station mexican station and a huge island station for sweets desserts this place is buffet heaven and for 50 this is worth every penny i will be back one day bacchanal buffet
  met up with friends recently at fez have never been a huge fan of this place but it s been a few years since my last visit nothing has really changed food isn t all that great or special i do like their drinks menu only thing truly special about fez is monika avalos
  my husband and i like trying new breweries when we are traveling so we decided to try heist brewery when we were in charlotte today we were the first people in the restaurant when they opened at 11 30 am and were seated immediately our server brought us waters and we decided to order a flight of beers from their list of about 12 beers the flight was reasonably priced with 5 generous pours for 6 the beers that we tried were i2pa peach hefeweizen belgian tripel maibock and a stout personally i liked the peach hefe and the maibock my favorite i thought the stout was too dry i really did not care for the belgian tripel and i am normally a big fan of belgian style beers i did not try the ipa personally but my husband said it was his favorite after our flight i ordered a peach hefe in a pint and my husband ordered the pale ale he liked the pale as well so overall the beers were a little hit or miss but the hits were good ones we also ordered lunch i ordered the pressed cheese sandwich with the rosemary tater tots the sandwich was a warm pimento cheese sandwich topped with sweet pickles it was served on jalapeno bacon focaccia bread the sandwich was fantastic it was surprisingly spicy and the flavor of the bread added a lot to the sandwich my husband ordered the italian sandwich he also was a big fan of his sandwich all of the breads here are homemade and it showed the tots were good but not outstanding and the portion size was small four tots each our server was very friendly and attentive and the space itself is very cool it is a fun industrial setting with a large bar and plenty of seating the interesting food menu definitely has a lot of potential we will return the next time we are in charlotte
  great mexican food and awesome restauranteur roberto welcomed us and treated us like family tocos are amazing carne assada was to die for and the chips and salsa was perfect great night out
  service was great but food was disappointing pork belly was too greasy and my short ribs were way too sweet mashed parsnips were sickly sweet with an odd aftertaste the fries with the lamb burger had a strange texture i don t think they used the right potatoes i really wanted to love this place from all the great reviews but am truly left disappointed
  my flight was delayed so luckily my parents live near by so i didn t have to be stuck at the airport for several hours i was annoyed and wanted a glass of wine or cocktail but didn t want to go to a casino or anywhere with a crowd of tourists so i decided to go somewhere the locals would go and thanks to yelp i found this place it was exactly what i was looking for i love the tall vaulted 30ft floor to ceiling with the modern yet vintage like light fixtures and the dark wood and inviting bar our waiter was super friendly and extremely attentive my choice of wine was great but i had to kick it up a notch due to my veins boiling from the involuntary choice of taking a red eye flight back home i have to say their expresso martinis are excellent we had just appetizers the hamachi calamari crab cakes mac and cheese and arugula salad the food was good but really nothing spectacular roger federer was playing and on the other hdtvs the dodgers were beating the padres don t know who actually won on either i was enjoying my expresso martini and my conversation with my parents i will definitely come back when i visit them again the expresso martinis were perfect not creamy or sweet but exactly how it should taste i loved it
  packed up the kids and headed down to try a new pizzeria called in the afternoon they said they would be open until 10 pm pulled up at 7 pm and they said sorry we are closed
  went for a friday night salsa night great crowd nice club cool bartenders i had a great time
  beautiful decor service is great the food is incredible 6 of us went for happy hour and the table was filled with fantastic plates lobster potstickers crab rangoon sushi edamame elements bowls etc and very reasonable even with drinks
  had a good time after hanging out at first friday drinks were excellent and husband said the calamari was great too
  my friends and i have developed a new system for our trips to vegas instead of making a list of all the places where we can get drunk we have lists of where we plan to grub first food bar was definitely a place we wanted to try especially since a friend of ours went ahead and tried the place and not only gave it a good review sent tantalizing pictures first food is located inside between the palazo and the venetian along the gondala canal right next to the barney s new york store on the second level of the palazo our party of 4 got seated in a booth along the window facing the strip and the big palazo marquee the view was great and definitely added to the ambiance of restaurant since it was a sunday night we didn t indulge in any cocktails our friend the junky one that went here before the rest of us did mention the cotton candy cocktail which is backed up by many yelpers here my friend and i were ready to have a realy grub moment so we each got an appetizer i went with the yelpers choice of mojito lamb chops and my friend went with the huge bacon wrapped shrimp the lamp chops are flambeed table side when they serve it so there definitely is a wow factor i did a pieced of the lamb chop back into the sauce after it was served and wow it most definitely has 151 in it the bacon wrapped shrimp was perfect and if i do say so myself la can use some bacon wrapped shrimp carts next to the hot dog ones outside of clubs and sporting events for the main course i got the shrimp diablo and my friends got cubano sandwich and the trout respectively the shrimp diablo was served with eggplant which make my mouth absolutely happy the heat from the sauce was a perfect blend of spice but not too hot that you would need a pitcher of water to calm our burnt taste buds my friends were pretty happy with their choices but i think it was dessert that pushed us over the edge i decided to do a throw back to my childhood and ordered the push pop yes just like the ones with the flintstone characters on it while my friends went with the molten chocolate cake and the s mores the push pop was well a push pop it was a very tangy sorbet that really cleansed my palate after eating very savory food the molten cake was pure chocolate goodness the s mores on the other hand just fucking amazing the graham crackers on the bottom could have been a little more moist but ugh the whole thing was just too amazing the toasted marshmallows on top just made my mouth happy overall i would give this place a 3 5 but with a photobooth located inside it s bumped up to a 4 we had two different servers help us and they were absolutely great one of them didn t really know all the components of a dish and rather than bullshit us he went and asked awesome definitely stop by if you are in vegas and looking for some good eats before doing whatever it is you do in vegas
  wow surprisingly good pico de oysters touched off by an excellent main course of o b s pan roast obs has a tasty sauce mix that is both smokey and sweet very good even the bottle beer was ice cold on a 100 degree las vegas day loved the place and would highly recommend
  since i m yelping everything else i went to in vegas why not include sinatra we went last night they had a nice table for us for two right by the window nice waiter was friendly and answered any and all questions the starter salads were amazing i had a hearts of romaine salad with gorgonzola walnuts and grapes the dressing of olive oil and vinegar was perfect not too strong and not too light one of the better salads i ve had since i ve been eating a lot of cow in vegas i decided on something different here i had the lobster risotto it was very very good normally risotto is topped off with a few bits of lobster if it s lobster risotto obviously not here i had a full half of a lobster with both claws on the risotto mixed into the lemony creamy peppery risotto with peas it was divine add in a nice white wine a chardonnay if you must know and it was a stellar meal i was a bit surprised honestly because based on the other reviews i thought it might just be another overpriced vegas restaurant from my experience though and i have had more than a few world class meals this is an excellent dining experience that should satisfy the pickiest of diners apparently steve wynn was buddies with old blue eyes hence the name of the place that s a nice tribute and it makes your dining that much more enjoyable if you re a frank fan which frankly i m not but can appreciate the tunes enjoy oh one last thing take out that second mortgage before coming here it will come in handy that is also true for most other restaurants in popular places in vegas though so no direct criticism here it would be nice if restaurants lowered prices somewhat to meet the bleakness of the economy but most must still be getting the prices they re asking for so pony up or go to in n out instead
  i tried the thin crust and had it delivered during the week in the early evening it is decent pizza and i would eat it again i still like a couple other places in the area better
  the food here is amazing for 13 99 you get 2 choices of meat a side and some bread the meat is super tender and has great taste there isn t a side that isn t good i especially love the green beans the customer service is always awesome the pit guy was super friendly and chatted with us for a few mins after checking to see how we were doing the manager even brought my 2 yr old a banana pudding because he gave him a high five this place is just overall awesome and worth the trip off the strip
  right on the las vegas national golf course great cheese burgers and bloody marys at a great price the rat pack bar grill is unique in that it serves as the home to the las vegas golf hall of fame exhibit happy hour 4 close
  went to the bar no acknowledgement after a few minutes got up and left no body cared to concerned w their wknd plans to worry about a customer leaving unserved disappointing sam fox
  first time there and impressed with the cleanliness friendly and prompt service and food good choices prices and portions waitress recommended the 2 pumpkin pancakes to add to our meal for 1 and they were great highly recommend
  stay away especially on busy nights they do not seem to have adequate staff and the food suffers and the service really suffers after much too long between courses the hot food came cold and appropriate silverware was not provided we had a large group but we were not all served our courses even close to the same time we had to ask for bread we visit madison often but we d never eat here again the meal was rather expensive but was unsatisfactory in every way discussion with management did not even result in an apology let alone an adjustment on our bill
  if you want good food they have it but if you want good food and a european style dining experience this is not the place to go it has the ambience but not the manners last evening i was in a group of ten who had dinner here we were there from 6 00 to about 8 15 food was very good we spent almost 500 our waiter came by and told us they had another group waiting for the table we were a group of friends enjoying an evening out couldn t they offer to put us at a different table since 4 of our party had already left or combine tables for the other party i wish i we would have thought to suggest this at the time but it happened so fast it was like what just happened here so we went to a neighboring restaurant for after dinner drinks and coffee i hope they take this review to heart in this crazy rushed world there is nothing like a relaxed evening with long time friends guess we ll have to find another place to do this
  i went there with my office colleagues for lunch they have pretty standard fare the service was no frills also i feel the portions were not sufficient we tried the noodle shrimp and chicken entree not their fried rice the prices were pretty low so i guess it kind of makes sense but its no fancy thai place you can try it if you are in the neighborhood
  here from fort worth tx rio was recommended by friends was as good as they said authentic mexican atmosphere freindly staff great servece the fajitas were great both steak and chicken would go again
  the first rule to keep customers coming back is to not do false advertisement i want to share my experience so this doesn t happen to anybody else again the have a board where they write the beer of the day and it was advertised kanika for 4 dollars we order several of the 4 dollar beers pointing to the board when talking to the waiter when they brought the check the beers were marked at 6 dollars on the check we asked the waiter and she said that kanika had 4 different beers and she brought us the one marked as 6 dollars so she was charging us 6 instead of 4 i told her that the beer was advertised as 4 and she said yes but its actually 6 even is 1 dollar or 2 dollars more than advertised is still fraud if they do this with beer i can not even start to imagine what they do when they cook i am defensibly sharing my experience with all people to prevent this from happening again shameful las vegas local
  i spent a good 6 hours of reading a book and reviewing it i had a very productive time there with the accompaniment of a nice atmosphere beautiful display good music and of course delicious coffee i ordered the velvet mocha to start it was rather sweet but sweetness isn t always a bad thing by lunch time i was famished so i ordered the pulled pork plate i was happy to see veggies mixed into the meal as well as good sourdough bread sliced thinly to complement pork the pork was very tender and the portion size was enormous i had a lot of eyes gravitating towards my meal oh so delish after a few more hours i ordered the hibiscus tea and must i mention there are free refills so before departure i got a refill of tropical iced tea with a touch of the organic orange blossom honey made available on the side bar i was rather impressed with the space availability even if i shared a 6 seater table with another person he was nice himself and inquired my whereabouts i thoroughly enjoyed this place i even took the light rail which was literally on the same street of the cafe convenience at best with a touch of lux ury
  a quiet secluded restaurant off the strip you need to enter from an elevator inside harrah s the window over looks the strip and you can see the caesars palace forum shops from there cozy and dimly lit atmosphere and live music inside a very nice get away from the sound of slot machines even nicer is the fact that we didnt need reservations and no long lines we got seated in less than 5mins the service is very attentive lots of staff asking if everything is ok the bread they serve while you wait is good the rib eye i ordered was huge i ordered medium well so it wasnt too burnt cooked perfectly juicy on the inside and grill lines on the outside you ll need to order extras such as baked potatoe which was good too definitely pricey but worth every cent i d go back just to get drinks at the bar
  french bistro style straight from paris finest quality modern french to be had in phoenix in the vast wasteland that is north scottsdale there are but few jewels among the cookie cutter chains zinc bistro stands in defiance of those mere reflections serving the most excellent of haute cuisine in its stalwart selections at lunch or dinner whether it be truffle omelet or the zinc burger or the newly added tomato bisque or the perennial crab salad ladies who lunch revolted when chef updated the presentation combined with the fabulous bread served on request a glass of chateau greysac and the heavenly chocolate chocolate souffle don t forget to order it in advance it s a meal fit for a proper two hour french luncheon the daily specials never cease to amaze just be sure to arrive by 11 30 if you hope to get one they go fast my other favorites include the scrumptiously delicate and rich scallops with lentils the prime flat iron steak with a delectable reduction and aromatic rosemary and of course the onion soup gratinee chef carter s pedigree shows in his food meticulously prepared cordon bleu chef christopher gross of christopher s now at the biltmore fashion park and chef dennis keller not to be missed whether you find yourself in kierland town or looking for an excuse to explore what used to be frank lloyd wright s desert view turned city zinc bistro is the crown jewel
  delicious fresh and healthy food i had driven past a different either old or not yet opened freshbox location on thompson peak and bell before and was happy to find out one had just opened in grayhawk the concept of this place is awesome very similar to grabbagreen though i think i prefer freshbox over grabbagreen now i love how all the fresh veggies and ingredients are on display very appealing i also like the design like how the lights are in wooden crates and the overall setup at first i was only going to get a juice i love vegetables but not big on vegetable juices so i tried the firefly because there was apple and lemon in it i hate to say but the juice was room temperature and i could only taste carrot and an overpowering ginger flavor i was disappointed and told someone working there i said i wanted to buy a salad instead and he was super nice about it and gave me the salad for free which i was super grateful for i got a build your own salad and it was awesome i got kale and arugula for my leafy greens black beans quinoa sweet potato and broccoli for my four toppings and goat cheese and almonds for my premium toppings also had the creamy avocado dressing i really enjoyed the salad very fresh and the portions were large i would love to come back and try out their cool lemonade flavors they sounded excellent i will definitely be returning a little expensive but completely worth it
  food is pretty good but the several times i ve gone here i leave upset the people who work there are rude every single time i ve gone they re rude it s like i m an inconvenience to the people working there that i m paying them for food to me it s not just about the food it s about the customer service and when i receive poor service more than 3 times in one place i m done
  this little vegas gem is located in the chinatown area mayweather gym is located 2 alley ways south this is the first for the chinatown area asian tacos i tried were a special seared poke taco and i m going back to kalbi taco both really good held together by flour tortillas and packed with flavor each taco runs about 4 miso soup and edamame for starters this is a small quaint place with great people and great food if you are hungry for some evening bites i recommend wok n roll great fusion flare on delicious asian food
  as i ve continued to come here i love what they re doing the pizza quality has not slipped and it seems like they worked out a lot of the issues with the two different businesses occupying the same space the employees are very helpful and professional this summer they ve even offered ice cream and not your typical flavors tonight i had the chardonnay strawberry ice cream which was absolutely delicious it had a faint savory almost cheesy taste and was like nothing i ve ever tasted be patient with the employees sometimes they dread ice cream orders since it means they have to go to the back cooler to scoop it out to order for customers also i tried the lunch slices for the first time and found it to be delicious it s different than their standard pizza it s more like a heavily topped focaccia today s special slice had kalamata olives and gorgonzola delicious
  ordered a calzone special it has mushrooms peppers pepperoni sausage and cheese hope i didn t leave anything out it was really good i live in peoria so i probably won t be back for that reason but if i was close by i d definitely stop in to try the rest of their menu
  i concur with most of these reviews great food and service shakes are unbelievably great get the one with pretzels in it the classic sweet and salty in a milkshake they have turkey chicken and veggie selections that are actually good lol got to talking to the server they had 1 000 applications hired 100 and trained them 9 days before they opened so they know about the food and how it is prepared will make it a point to stop by again in the near future
  came out here for a girls night and had a fantastic time they have great seating inside or out the bruschetta board was excellent and the wine selection was great
  wow had an amazing dinner here last night with my brother and i must say i was amazed let me preface that i ve been to s korea two times and eat korean in toronto all the time and their food was excellent fresh and flavourful we ordered 2 bibimbap s with jap chae and they had a really nice banchan of the regular kimchi sweet potato and other veggie delicacies definitely coming back for the dok boki and fried chicken
  seated promptly 1 star everything else was crap 20 minutes without even a hello have no idea who was our server lots of other servers at tables around us and nothing the common proactive courtesy when you see someone trying to make eye contact and wave someone down hi has someone taken your order yet let me find your server for you but no one said a word to us we walked out 3 people said thanks guys have a great day uh never served still hungry never again
  5 star update this is so far my favorite place for tacos in madison if you re looking for tasty authentic mexican eats this is the place to get it i went back a few times for lunch recently and left super satisfied here s how it goes 1 walk in head straight back and grab a beverage from the cooler mexican coke anyone 2 take a seat any seat and wait sometimes a while 3 place your order 3 tacos campechano al pastor and steak 4 eat 5 pay 6 bucks that s some cheap eats friends i recommend eating in so you can try their amazing sauces in your tacos everything comes out fast hot and fresh everything i ve had here has been incredibly tasty service isn t the best but the food is so tasty that i don t care when you re done eating check out the store you ll find some housewares spices groceries and even some of the meat you just consumed pastor meat get it i still need to get out there on the weekend to try their specials barbacoa pozole carnitas and chiles rellenos are a few that come to mind the best taco in madison chorizo and some crispy steak bits do yourself a favor and get this
  been driving past this place for the longest time and never noticed it before i yelped it happy we found this hidden gem the service was wonderful and it gets packed later on at night there was a wide selection of food and beverages and we enjoyed our meal very much everything was fantastic i just wished our food came a bit faster
  first time here we are here on a friday night chose the bar side first impression is atmosphere clean finished decor sometimes new places open and decor is not finished love the lighting great dining lighting staff super friendly attentive we had stuffed mushrooms appetizer fresh and hot we then had thin crust pizza again fresh hot had some house wines prices are very affordable love they kept dining room separate from the bar nice atmosphere in the bar place is currently full we will definitely be back
  az bread company is as tasty as breakfast gets you go up to the counter order your food grab some drinks and seat yourself that is if you can even grab a seat during their busy hours the prices are not bad at all for the quality and quantity of food you get for 8 bucks i had 4 strawberry pancakes turkey sausage and a scrambled egg i finished my plate because it was so good but i ended up being so mad at myself for doing so their coffee was good and they also provide flavored creamers they have a wide variety of food from savory breakfast plates to sweet pancakes they even serve lunch unfortunately they close at 2 pm so if you want to go and try this place the best time might be around 11
  had a great meal here last weekend while visiting charlotte had a slighly tough time finding it found the address with no problem but didn t see the restaurant initially it s tucked behind the fountain in the corner staff were very friendly decor was nice on a friday night around 915 ish the last of the big crowd were finishing up and we were able to get a table with no wait my friend and i split 3 rolls sexy salmon catepillar and another that i already forgot they were all excellent location was convenient because from where we parked we were able to walk to the uptown bars will definitely return
  this place looks like a cool bar restaurant but it was terrible we waited 30 min for a burger and then the server charged a 5 split plate fee because my husband and i split he didn t even make us aware of the charge until we got our bill and then told us that it was noted on the menu so he couldn t reverse it we called the manager after we left and he said he would credit our check well he never did it the burger was overcooked and the fries were cold i would never visit this place again
  this was definitely a hidden jewel i am so glad that i found it on yelp the food was great the service was great and the atmosphere was fun and inviting they seem to have some great prices for happy hour also i will definitely be back here its worth the drive
  mmmmmm mamma mia so much has already been said already but i still feel compelled to throw in my two cents worth my ideal friday night a medium mushroom pie extra crispy which is still fold able btw with one of their huge antipasto salad regarding the salad think less traditional antipasto and more like the ideal chef salad with the perfect balance of meats cheeses sun dried tomatoes and pepperocinis oh just writing about this salad makes my mouth water and when i say huge it s really enough to make 3 to 4 decent sides or two ginorous meals the staff is extraordinarily nice one evening i called in an order rather late and they were tidying up in the back they asked if i was there for a pick up and when i said i was they had me come in through the back rather than walk around to the front by myself in the dark it s those kind of touches that make this place feel very warm and homey and the last time i was in i finally inquired about their delivery area and was pleasantly surprised that i am just inside the borders yeah me others have pretty much covered the range of the wonders contained in this small space so let me just add that they are one of the participants in the restaurant com program so you can actually score some really cheap food here if you have a little pre planning action going on although this location focuses on a pared down menu all of the must haves are represented so if you haven t already given mamma mia s a try you really must
  my friend and i came here because that there were themed nights to participate in originally we came for mustache monday however instead participated in the trivia night although we were absolutely awful at the trivia itself we had so much fun the staff was super nice and attentive and definitely made us feel very welcome the best part about the trivia night is that the winners of every round get a prize more incentive to win no monkey pants has a very chill and homey feel to it and i really enjoy that honestly my friend and i plan on making as many trivia nights as we can because it was so fun the food is also nicely priced with daily deals and happy hour deals
  great happy hour best micro brew beer selection on this side of town definitely not just your run of the mill boring beers the food was great too cuban sandwich was delicious along with great wings that were on special for 45 cents a wing french fries were the best around definitely homemade we will be back
  this is an ok place i probably would have rated it 4 stars based on my first visit but my second visit was disappointing so it evens out to 3 stars a word of caution if you get a hamburger i got the nom nom burger be careful as they are hot hot enough to burn your mouth it s a good burger the onion rings are really good but the shakes are just standard at least my chocolate shake was that was my first visit and i would have said it was a 4 star experience the second time i got the truffle lobster mac and cheese almost 17 and the philly egg rolls 13 while the food was good especially the egg rolls i felt taken the amount of food for almost 30 that you receive was pathetic i was completely blown away i wish i would have gone elsewhere and had it not been for my first experience here i would have rated this place a 1 star joint i would recommend this place if you don t order anything from the nosh menu unless of course you re just rolling it and don t care to be ripped off
  the food was ok it was the service that brought down the rating so much first off our server must have been new so being a fellow service industry worker i definitely tried to be patient and understanding she took our orders and was quick to bring us our chips and salsa but when our dinners came immediately we realized that she had forgotten to sans the black olives and onions from my boyfriends order not a big problem he just picked them off and gave them to me after a couple bites of my sides i dug into my burrito which i realized was definitely not a chicken burrito like i had ordered i got the waitresses attention and she asked if i still wanted to eat it or if she should bring it back i asked to have my original order and she took my plate away apologetically still not a big deal she brought back my burrito minus my sides i was a little disappointed i wanted the sides that came with my meal i motioned her back to the table and asked if i could have my sides of rice and beans a couple minutes later she returned not with warm new sides but with my old plate of now cold picked at rice and beans minus the burrito it was as if she pulled it out of the sink off of a stack of dishes to be washed to bring back to me because god forbid they mess up an order and refresh a customers side of rice and beans i was baffled by this completely and utterly baffled
  great subs i had the firehouse hero which was served warm and had a flavor i know i will crave again
  this is a must whenever i visit vegas lots of seating extensive menu and quick service pho always hits the spot
  love it swing by food is great and everyone is friendly game machines coming soon definitely the new spot
  when you visit a celebrity chef s restaurant you expect a lot when you visit emeril s you expect bam out of every bite nah t he food is ok something i would try again if i didn t have to spend and if it was located in skokie otherwise i found my meal un bam worthy and ordinary
  i had never been to a quaker steak and lube before i had seen other people eat it i had heard what they served and how the food was but i finally got to see for myself so upon entering the establishment i looked up at the menu and saw plenty of tasty choices i walked to the counter and discovered that my cashier s name was shaggy thought to myself ok this is going to be a good visit for sure i ordered the mac and cheese and 6 louisiana licker boneless wings i waited somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes for my food then picked it up at the window the wings were quite tasty not too bland not too spicy the mac and cheese was good too
  i felt inclined to write my first review on yelp due to this place you know every kid says pizza is their favorite food well it s stuck with me and i can call myself a pizza connoisseur among other things ranch sauce crab rangoons meatballs cheeseburgers butter etc so here s the nights order of events step 1 drink a ton of drinks at rockbar right across the street step 2 get hungry as a motha and walk to one of the two late night food establishments around there that i actually knew about didn t know about kiss step 3 i picked the place called best of italy for a couple slices of pizza step 4 regret going to best of italy because their pizza always sucks but i always hope for the best step 5 walk back to craftsman ct to find a cab step 6 see the open sign at this place called kiss and would love to give my food craving a second chance make myself an ultra chubby guy step 7 walk in there and order 2 slices of pizza it was about 2 30am and i had no idea what to expect the place is tiny inside with only a few tables but there were a bunch of people at all of them waiting for their food there was no line and i was immediately helped i got 2 slices of sausage chicago style stuffed pizza to go i think the total was something like 10 and i tipped the guy a couple bucks because hey i wouldn t want to be slinging pizza at 2am but someone is kind enough to do it the pizza came out within a few minutes and while he was boxing it up he threw in a couple slices of thin crust cheese pizza for free fantastic i ate a slice of the chicago style while waiting for a cab to come by and was surprised at how good it was it was legit one of the best chicago style stuffed i ve had out here i m from the midwest and have been trying to find a place besides oregano s that has a good stuffed pizza and i think i definitely found my go to spot i see other reviews say it s only open on fridays and saturdays and if that s the case it s a shame either way you won t be disappointed if you had what i had definitely worth 5 stars in my pizza connoisseur book now i m going to go to bed and make love to this other slice
  nice place to grab a bite to eat at the wynn without breaking the bank the zooza burger with pastrami on it was quite filling to say the least
  i was here again for their margarita brunch i still have to say how can this be legal it s great the buffet itself is actually pretty good my favorite items were the chimichangas and green chile pork stew the huevos rancheros were also very good there are plenty of other options as well as an omelet station the margaritas here are very good and very strong be careful they have a very friendly staff as well
  i like their food good prices
  fun place great great food very friendly staff made me look good to my friends as i chose it wonderful eclectic menu tons of flavor so good
  omg i have never seen a place like this is so awesome outside tables they have a fire pit you can buy the makings for s mores and makes at your they have a full bar live music usually on the weekends and a dance floor great for just adults or great for families and kids they have food such as steaks hamburgers finger foods so they have a wide array of food i guarantee you will love this place if you have anybody coming in town it s a must you must take them all i can say is go go go u will love it
  cheese nachos so yummy an the mac an cheese is the shit
  the furnishings were clean updated had greasy smell when walked in door but i expect that from fast food establishment everything we ordered was exceptionally fresh the bread was fresh staff sliced the roast beef fresh the cooking area appears clean and the staff was friendly i m glad we stopped in 15 for two to eat drank water and one yummy salty caramel shake almost didnt stop in because of last review and they play american country music if anyone is interested im not fond of it but it is different for phoenix az
  good japanese food teisoku box are good combos and if your in the mood for all you can eat sushi this is the place to grind
  i m been trying to get the man to accompany me to treacle for months now finally on a hungover sunday afternoon he relented we weren t in the mood for a full meal just a bit of something to snack on to appease our bellies until dinner the menu had some yum sounding sharing platters and appetisers so we headed in we were immediately greeted by a member of staff who escorted us to a table which we never would have seen otherwise the man ordered some tasty mint rosehips and apple tea see above re hangover which he literally raved about through the entire meal he actually made me go with him to real foods afterwards to try to find the ingredients so he could recreate his tea joy i ordered a margarita which i unfortunately have to admit did not rock my world it had table salt instead of rock salt on the rim tasted a bit watery and didn t have a great punch of flavour which i m used to our food however was delicious we shared the coconut chicken with ginger dipping sauce and sweet potato spinach and goats cheese pie with hand cut chips the coconut chicken was mega tasty but oh wow that pie was dreamy we were both incredibly impressed i m not a huge goats cheese person but it was just enough to add a bit of depth and saltiness to contrast the sweet potato without being overwhelming the chips too were seriously nice the man happily patted himself on the back for choosing the pie and pretended not to hear me when i reminded him that he hadn t wanted to give treacle a chance and i d had to drag him there cheeky monkey the only issue was that the man felt the food was a bit overpriced for what it was it was more in the realm of restaurant pricing than bar meal pricing i see the point there but think that the quality of the food was such that it s a great wee treat to have with cocktails i also felt a bit iffy about the service we had a bit of a mix up when we first ordered and felt like we d miffed the servers who never came to check if our food was ok and afterwards only made eye contact when we were paying the bill so it was a bit of a mixed experience really quality food less quality service and mid range drink i will definitely come back though and am looking forward to trying more of the food and cocktail menus
  sunday champagne brunch fantastic this is the best buffet in vegas i don t need to say anymore you re reading this review somewhere on the strip casino hotel room looking you are looking for the best buffet because you just lost your shirt on the tables and slots so you want to eat your money s worth here it is now turn off your iphone laptop droid ipad whatever it s time to eat
  decent food court option it s pricey like airport food though 8 for a large sandwich 4 to add a small drink fry 6 for a regular drink fry add on it gets pricey fast but on the bright side the cheesesteaks are actually pretty tasty your choice of cheese several combinations of mushrooms peppers onions etc you can also customize fries and add cheese gravy chili and other toppings not a place to hit on a diet
  what a great find a very reasonable price good for the entire family the food was better than i expected no wonder there was a long line i got too full i couldn t get to the famous oxtail soup that everyone is raving about well next time my favorite was their kahlua pork and chocolate cake
  the waitresses that work weekdays are awesome i think i m in love non creepy kind with one of them i think she s middle eastern or italian on second thought she might be some kind of spanish anyway the food is great especially the shwarma and lentil soup the hummus and pita can be described in one word totally awesome i realize that s two words but i got excited when trying to come up with a description oh and if you re a fan of classy interior decoration you re in for a treat if you ve ever wondered to yourself who buys the broken crap in the sale bins at home goods now you know it s an elegant mix of middle eastern country and random they even have a deer made out of stone near the cash register classy they re mixing exterior lawn decoration with the interior am i inside am i outside who knows once you get your food you ll stop caring and your mind will focus on the awesome flavors and smells which by the way make your fridge smell like a persian carpet salesman if left overnight not complaining just stating fact seriously though go here your stomach will thank you unless you have an ungrateful stomach
  came here for a birthday the cocktail was good and the red velvet cake was a bit too sweet and good in flavor
  first off the inside is very nice and it has a great atmosphere service was good i had a carnitas burrito and enjoyed it i also tried the pastro taco which i ve never been a fan of so i won t judge it i guess but i will judge the carne asada fries which i felt were okay just a little dry
  i have been waiting to get in here and did yesterday great location cool design great staff the menu looks really good crispiest fried pickles i have ever had strong but tasty horseradish sauce on the side the ruben i had was a disappoint though i think the menu lists pastrami not corned beef this would make it a rachel in either case pastrami corned beef is a made from brisket tough and chewy therefore it needs to be shaved super thin alas mine was close to 1 4 thick very tough and the bread was not well griddled makiing it very messy for some reason the sandwich no side comes on a very small plate so there is no room to set the thing down once you start eating and juice fills the small plates surface i found out that it is part of the whiskey warehouse group one of my favs so will be back often i am certain they will get better quickly can t wait to try more design 4 service 4 food 3 total 3 5 the extra 1 2 star is whiskey warehouse good will
  my wife and i were craving bun and our normal place pho mai lan was closed for the evening so we decided to go for it and give this place a shot well it sure was a mistake we walked in and they asked us how many we told them two and they walked us over to a table set down two glasses of water and walked away came back a minute later and set down two menus with our napkins on top then walked away again after about 5 minutes they come back over and ask us what we wanted we hadn t decided just yet and we asked for another minute and the reply was okay just yell for me when your ready and then she walked away okay by now they ve lost any chance at a tip so after we decided to get s 69 and 70 we looked around and they came over took our order and about 10 minutes later our food came out it looked good well it wasn t it was a huge disappointment the shrimp on both plates were dry like last weeks left overs that they nuked for a minute and tossed in our dish our pork was a little on the burn side and had a funk nasty after taste but it wasn t terrible enough to not eat and my roll was fairly uncomfortable to eat we d have to say the worst part was the fish sauce that wasn t to great so while we ate the atmosphere wasn t very inviting the wait staff was talking on their phones while they were on speaker so we could hear all of their conversation it was also not very welcoming when they would look at us hoping we would leave all in all everything was terrible except their pricing was pretty fair
  i used to go here when i was a kid it now is awful very overpriced and the seafood tastes disgusting
  i have been going to the one in tempe for years and never had a bad experience i got a coupon in the mail for a free appetizer so i figured i would try it upon arrival i waited 10 minutes before i was acknowledged so i say myself at the bar not kore then 5 people in the restaurant the bartender completely ignored me because she was too busy talking to somebody at the end of the bar i just assumed it was her boyfriend finally after getting her attention she came over and very rudely said what can i get you i explained to her that i had a free appetizer from the coupon sent to me in the mail and i also decided to get the fish and chips with the pretzel appetizer which i do you normally do get at tempe location i also ordered a beer which took about 15 minutes to get there when i finally received my food it they both came on at the same time i really would have liked my appetizer pretzel first however i didn t complain they forgot to give me tartar sauce for the fish and chips after i asked her for the north side of tartar sauce she completely ignored me also the queso dip for the pretzels seem to be heard and on top like it had been sitting around for awhile so i requested another one with a side of some sort of mustard after that she walked away seem very angry with me i decided that i was going to leave i requested the bill and to go boxes which she completely ignored i work in the food industry and i have never been known anybody to be treated this way i was so appalled i really didn t feel like being at the restaurant anymore so i requested my bill after waiting 10 minutes for my bill to come it finally arrived with the appetizer on the bill i explained to her that only the coupon and she had taken it already i was so upset i just i wanted to get out of there so i left 30 on the bar and left i will never return to the thirsty lion
  these stars are for the customer arrive i got from the manager mr jay he was extremely sweet n a wonderful guy thanks for such a great service
  the presentation was lovely and the mushroom skewers were artful and tasty however the meal was very overpriced i ordered mochi ice cream for dessert and the taste was okay price silly but again it was a piece of art
  place is pretty cool the drinks are medium oh priced and it s in china town so the location is pretty convenient the karaoke rooms are a great way to make a fool of yourself
  are you freakin kidding me i can t see how this place could possibly get more than one star in fact if i could give it zero stars that s what i d do terrible service and someone was having a big screaming match in the back so they turned the music up to try to drown them out tough disgusting dry overcooked excuse of lamb kabob with sides that weren t any better decor 1 service 1 screaming match 5 food 1 if you want good kabobs there are way better places to go yuck place seems to be under new ownership and the location looked different i wonder if my past review was confused about locale or if this one is
  olive garden has lost it s luster the good things on the menu manicotti and the braised ribs with risotto are gone the low fat pasta was just noodles and tomatoes no seasonings to speak of the only reason to go is salad otherwise just another tired chain better to eat local business
  went for lunch no one wanted to go in on a sushi platter so i had the spicy seafood udon not sure what i was thinking i generally avoid shellfish this far inland as a general rule anyhow it was a decent red broth with one scallop two shrimp and one clam for 8 95 and a dollar more than the vegetable udon i m not complaining but it was not very spicy but the noodles were hot enough to burn my mouth large good for big groups lunch service was okay but not very attentive given how slow it was anyhow i d like to go back for the bbq or sushi and hopefully have a 4 star experience
  yelp 100 challenge 13 100 knowing what this restaurant has in store for special occasions i made a prior reservation here and brought my parents to celebrate my mom s advance birthday after our first movie at the theater we were quite the hungry hannahs and contrary to our plan to share a couple of dishes we picked an order each papa had the tenderloin tips served medium well with a side of mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables presented in a decent portion for only 9 99 meanwhile mommy had the sandwich duo this is a fun mix and match pickin you have a choice at half a sandwich tuna albacore cashew chicken clubhouse roasted turkey with a side of either a salad or soup for only 7 99 she ordered the clubhouse with a side of potato cheddar soup which was the bomb and an extra cesar salad which amounted to about 10 as well not entirely sure about that i in turn got myself the chopped steak it s ground beef almost bordering on thick beef patty with a topping choice of either cheddar tomato or glazed mushrooms and onions in burgundy sauce i chose the latter next to some mashed potato i admit it was very filling so much so i wasn t even able to take it all in before we ended i buzzed our waiter a quick reminder about my mom s birthday and he came with their signature red velvet cupcake with a candle on top she made her wish blew the candle and commented that the service was pleasant and full of surprises
  terrible service don t waste your time all the host and hostess did was talk amongst each other with no care for the customer and when we finally got seated the server was nowhere to be found we just got up and left
  it s a great place with healthy food that s actually good service was good and the owner is very on hands it s near my house so even when i m in a rush i ll stop in to get a good smoothie
  first time trying this place out my boyfriend wanted sushi and has been looking for a sushi spot with the conveyor belt just like the ones we have back home in hawaii going in it was really busy which i expected on a friday night i liked that the sushi on the conveyor had lids on them not like back home the prices were hella cheap and i must say the portion size was a good deal for the price comparison to genki sushi price and portion that was a big plus for me i liked the hawaiian roll if you re an ahi fan you must get it the rainbow roll is also yums the only downfall which lacked my 5 star rating was the service i didn t get everything that was on my list which they give you at the start to check mark what you want also all night they didn t refill our water i had to share with my boyfriend no one came to ask if we needed anything and i felt as if i needed a buzzer just to get the waiters attention so glad we had our sake bombs to keep us occupied i understand it was busy but i think they need a better system or more workers to care for everyone s needs overall i would still go back the sevice just needs working on
  absolutely the best meal we had while staying on fremont street everything from the bread to the main courses were expertly prepared and served by our awesome waiter andrew steaks were rare as ordered tender and delicious and my spicy pasta with scallops and shrimp was absolutely amazing thanks from your oregon friends
  i am so glad my girl johnie showed us this place the food is beyond delicious it s unlike any mexican food i ve ever had gourmet mexican if such exists we had queso fundido with mushrooms so perfected seasoned and accentuated with fresh herbs n veggies i wanted to try the veggie tacos but the one drawback was the chef refused to make them without celery for me so upon our exceptional bartender greg s recommendation i got the mahi tacos so delicious and fresh i m super picky about seafood and this is tops the mango margaritas were on point and half off for locals on monday made the slightly high but totally worth it for the quality so easy to bear another drink please
  i ve lived in italy for 6 months and can say that the food here is extremely authentic that said i d rather eat it in tuscany than in las vegas because the portions here are small and unsatisfying and more expensive we paid 35 for each pasta dish and granted one was the one with 1 lb of lobster the other which just had chanterelles and charred corn did not have any expensive ingredient and was even smaller than mine portion size aside the flavors were just not that inventive or perfected as you would expect from batali the paglia e fieno was really salty the main flavor and my spaghettini was rather bland the calamari appetizer was delicious and leads me to believe there are other star dishes on the menu but when i go to a restaurant like b b i don t want to have to hunt for what s good it should all be impressive maybe asking too much but who else to ask that from but batali bastianich i think i paid more for their names than their actual influence on the restaurant
  like most other reviewers who live in the neighborhood we were thrilled when bonefish opened since then we have been there many times both for dinner and happy hour however they recently did away with the happy hour food menu the restaurant is very attractive both in the main dining room and bar although the food is pretty good the service is hit and miss mostly miss the experience starts at the check in desk which is always a challenge as the girl acts like she has no clue why you are standing there not the least bit welcoming when it first opened it was pretty crowded you really needed reservations but now they are hurting for customers we used to go during the week for happy hour and there were a few occupied tables in the bar but only one or two in the main dining room since they did away with the hh food there are hardly any occupied tables in the bar and only a couple in the main dining room how the servers make any money is beyond me they spend a lot of time watching sporting events on the tv in the bar having lived in this area for thirty years we were hoping this restaurant would be successful but it leaves a lot to be desired the service is overall painfully slow and the servers continue to make simple errors in describing the menu the managers wander around and don t do very much sometimes they stop by to see how your meal is but most times they don t until the wait staff is better trained and move with a purpose bonefish will continue to suffer it is too bad because the food is good there are also many restaurants which offer fantastic happy hour food items within a few miles of bonefish i am afraid this bonefish will go the same route as the one in mesa which is now closed we will not return for happy hour and may or may not return for dinner
  everyone loves a good hot dog now imagine that good hot dog wrapped in bacon on mexican style buns oh my lord i m getting excited first of all the nogales hot dog cart is located on 20th st and indian school in a random parking lot don t let it deter you its nice and dark out there so i enjoy going often in my pajamas the standard hot dog is wrapped in bacon and served wit mayonnaise tomatoes and pinto beans on top i generally add cojita cheese a spicy green chile and mushrooms yes mushrooms they also have a guacamole type sauce hot peppers and mexican soda they have everything i would just like to say that i think that the service is outstanding the men and women that run the cart are always so friendly and very helpful they even gave my boyfriend a t shirt once you have to try these hot dogs
  brought a friend from out of town here for breakfast on a sunday and while it was busy we were able to find a seat at the bar the food was excellent i had the avocado omelette and she had the left coast blt being from ca she had to try it we were both not disappointed the food was excellent and the servers were all very nice will definately be back again
  outstanding sushi with a memorable view and excellent service everything i tried was some of the best i ve had in my life the shrimp and vegetable tempura were lightly battered and cooked to a crispy perfection the assortment of the vegetables was nicely varied it was the first time i had a beet in the tempura ensemble the sushi was absolutely fresh and well presented the traditional nigiri pieces tuna salmon tomago hamachi etc were all perfect but the one that stood out was the toro i have never had such nice pieces of toro before at any sushi place the jidori organic chicken grilled on a skewer under the robatyaki section was nicely cooked tender and well seasoned obviously this meal will not be cheap so if you re looking for a value do not bother if however you and a significant other want one of the best sushi meals with great service and outstanding food and view you ll want to give mizumi a try
  great sports bar with amazing food i have been coming to zipps for years the monaco foaccaca is literally amazing this place is a definite must
  first time here very busy for lunch hope the food is good okay got my take out order for me and a person at work we ordered the pad thai papaya salad and lat na all thai dishes i have to say that the food was very good with good sized portions but the thai food is a vietnamese version i look forward to trying the pho next time i m sure it will be great
  i love myself some good old breakfast every so often but i love myself some good old breakfast when i am hungover especially my first time in montreal was a mix of epic terrifying fun and extra sloppy i am dying to go back i was fortunate enough to have gotten food from a few awesome locations eggspectations being one of them this review might be a bit lopsided because well i was just ecstatic to be alive and eating something after a night of madness we entered and the line was overwhelming we got a name in and thus began the epic and painful wait period servers passed with plates of food that looked like breakfast art i grew hungrier and finally after half an hour we were summoned everyone got there juice beer and coffee on i went with a mango blend and a shot of rum the blend was great but the shot was some absolute fire water the sausages my god the sausages were good no grit just a snappy shell and mushy meaty goodness inside i had the mother and child to eat call me a horrible human being but chicken on chicken has always appealed to me the eggs of course were awesome the chicken breast was great it was all just great i need to stress the breakfast here looks really pretty even the drinks seemed oddly perfect in appearance the server was more than pleasant for a first time bite eggspectations did not disappoint would i go back 100 yes indeed
  i have been going to this place for a few years now the food is great it is grilled with light seasoning and goes perfectly with warm flour tortillas you might want to avoid going at lunch time because they are super busy and it is hard to get a seat if you work in the area call ahead and pick it up
  they ve been mentioned in other reviews but seriously holy cow the spring rolls two full jumbo shrimp are rolled up with a bunch of other good stuff and the sauce they bring out with the spring rolls is just incredible i was literally eating the spring roll sauce with my spoon for her meal the fiancee got the bun yum and really liked it i got the steak and rice which was ok though pretty boring luckily they brought out some of that magical neon orange sweet spicy sauce that makes everything taste better and then my meal was good neon orange sauce notwithstanding i ll order something different next time we go yes we ll definitely go again
  my buddy and i went to this location today we are by no means experts but we have competed in bbq competitions in texas on several occasions this place is a disgrace to texas and should not have the title bbq attached to its name we had the pulled pork brisket and the spicy cheddar sausage there was no bark and no smoke ring on the pork and brisket the meat had no smell of smoke whatsoever and it had no flavor at all this bbq tasted like it was cooked in an oven for meat that is cooked for 12 hours with hickory i m completely blown away this was hands down the worst bbq we have ever eaten the sausage was obviously store bought and this was the best we had we were appalled at the sauce as well it was sweet north carolina sauce that is heavily infused with vinegar
  excellent food hands down the happy hour deal is likewise excellent unfortunately word has been out for some time and happy hour here is ridiculous you will have to arrive at 5pm sharp to get a seat the seating at the bar is great especially the view of the open kitchen adds to the culinary experience service for the most part is good it can be hit or miss however the sushi special is always excellent and the robata grill is my personal favorite the salmon robata is well seasoned and prepared perfectly the chicken robata is somewhat bland and subpar and is the exception to all of the excellent dishes we ve had i think if it weren t for the inconsistency of service i would give this 5 stars
  if you don t want msg in your food tell the server before you place the order lunch prices are good
  saw this several times on my way home food is excellent overall my lamb was well done not dry but overcooked surprisingly the ground lamb beef shish kabob was outstanding superb seasoning over all my wifes gyro was good a 4 star sandwich service is sub par i had to go ask for a drink refill we were the only people in the entire store the lamb makes it a 4 star the service a 2 star the seasoned food was outstanding so i gave it a 4 in the end
  the look is quite appetizing but the taste is a bit off for asian palate not recommended and wont come back
  if you like crab legs this is the place for you if you don t like crab legs forget about it because the rest of it is only okay i liked the paella which had some good tidbits of seafood in it of course the crab legs and claws couldn t get enough the little lobster slippers were yummy along with the shrimp the sashimi was okay my only complaints were that the prime rib was not good at all and the desserts were kind of lacking but they never stopped filling up the seafood station and there were multiple of the crab and lobster areas so that was a positive their lack of variety is made up for their quantities of the main seafood this makes it the best seafood buffet i ve been to
  food was excellent slightly limited menu but any place that is vegan friendly is hard to come by so i was happy small place with a peaceful atmosphere
  my issue with this place is that when you are supposed to open at 10 am please be on time i have been there multiple times at 10am and the place is closed signs are posted open at 10am
  great breakfast both my wife and i shared a breakfast pizza and it was delicious the 12 watermelon drink called hat bender was also good my wife ordered that and i tried a little our server dieago was a super nice and friendly guy he s the one that recommend the pizza and drink nothing bad to say and i would return again
  i love this place so if you re looking for a quaint cafe with an ample supply of pastries and even french style sandwiches go here
  this is one of my favorite restaurants i hate that the concord mills location closed down however i m happy this location opened up i usually order my food to go here but when i come to dine in the staff is very quick to take my order my favorite things on the menu are the wings and the macaroni i honestly think the wings are one of the best in charlotte the wings combine the perfect sauce and a good crunch
  best fried pickles in town
  the barrymore is a hidden gem in a city where there are so many big name chefs and restaurants it s off the beat and track hidden away just off the strip the ambiance and look is very stylish with a 1950 s rat pack feel super cool vibe the service and food was amazing get the filet amazing the booths are huge and comfy great date night spot very intimate and romantic i would definitely recommend this hip and elegant restaurant to anyone
  love this place delicious food and friendly staff i frequent this place
  the boyfriend had one place in mind for out first late night meal in vegas hashhouseagogo the whole drive there my little kid at heart bf was excited about the chicken waffles we would be eatting later as soon as the rest of our group made it to vegas we hit imperial palace after a walk down a shady alley a maze of escalators we finally got to hash house too my boyfriends very very very severeeee disappointment the chicken waffles was not served on the late menu because we were there at midnite omg what a serious bust for us the boyfriend was pissed to say the least so we ordered him up an arrogant bastard to nurse calm his dissapointment away i found the indiana which was the closest thing for him it came with sage fried chicken eggs potato a relaly hard biscuit i ordered a blueberry pecan flapjack so he i could share the chicken was delicious no wonder the rave reviews and the flapjack was ginormous and off the chain yummy the whole table could have shared and left full just off of that plate loved it i also ordered their watermelon kiwi drink because my friend amy did it was just beyond pretty but its pretty much just pretty haha unless you reallllly like sour stuff which i obviously dont after that drink my lips were permanently puckered for the rest of the nite service is a win as well
  excellent food that is reasonably priced portion sizes can be improved but overall it was a very pleasant experience this is one of the best indian food i ve had outside of india
  for a french person the bread is simply horrible but it might be a matter of taste the linguine vongole are both the most expensive and the worst i ever had pasta was overcooked very few clams tasteless sauce waiters kept on bumping into my chair first glass of champagne came from a bottle that was opened so long ago it wasn t sparkling anymore and i had to ask to replace it there are plenty of other options in vegas and although the view here is nice right next to the bellagio fountains the culinary experience was a total letdown
  oh ruth s chris you were so good at the yelp elite event when you first opened at the harrah s what happened at the request of my mom she was my plus one at the elite event and was very impressed we celebrated my brother s birthday at ruth s chris a couple of weeks ago please be forewarned that there is no valet or self parking anywhere near ruth s chris it s at the exact opposite of all the entrances if you are arriving by car the one star is for the decoration of the restaurant but that was it from the bread the 400 degree hot plate of bone in ribeye to our server s unkempt attire it was not the upscale experience food or service ruth s chris is supposed to be by no mean am i trying to be a snob about the whole affair i think i am capable of adjusting my standards based on where i am at however for the price and the service i d take my dollar right next door to the caesar s palace joe s stonecrab and be a happier customer
  i live in tucson but every time i come to phoenix i make sure to eat at ike s the first thing i noticed during my first visit was how extraordinary the service as and this isn t even a dine in place the guy behind the counter greeted us genuinely and everyone else working seemed happy to be there after we put in our order we ended up talking to the cashier for like 30 more minutes every interaction is genuine and enthusiastic which is really something unique and goodness the sandwiches i was so impressed with how many options there were for people of all different diets halal chicken vegetarian vegan and plenty for meat lovers the options are literally endless the sandwiches are huge and make my heart happy and to top it off they give you free caramel apple lollipops what an awesome little perk overall if you live in the phoenix area you must try eating here
  really a terrible disappointment way overpriced food is average to below average service is almost obnoxious and restaurant decor is like a holiday inn restaurant would never go back even if they offered a free meal waste of time and money and a horrible disappointment for what was supposed to be a special night
  date time monday 6 30pm occasion dinner party of eight ordered blue crab shrimp louie cocktail appetizer nebraska 16oz ribeye aged 35 days topped with bone marrow creamed spinach side location fancy unique looking decor chairs could be nicer similar to office chairs other than that love the look total incl gratuity 125 per person i waited a long time to finally try this place they start you with these parmesan bread sticks that are to die for our party was literally fighting over them haha they also have a nice little bread selection one of which is a pretzel bread which was very good the blue crab salad came highly recommended from a friend great choice it was fresh and the ingredients came together for a very good start crab shrimp louie dressing tomatoes avocado just nice chilled yummy seafood goodness upon reading reviews from fellow yelpers i decided to go with the nebraska ribeye topped with bone marrow it was considerably more flavorful than the illinois fed ribeye i thought the meat was prepared well though not sure if it justifies a near 80 price tag i tried the illinois fed ribeye not bad seemingly a little tougher than my nebraska all of the sides our table shared were amazing had a small portion of the mac n cheese it was a scoop of yummy cheesy heaven the creamed spinach was topped with a fried egg which is what really caught my attention very good would order it again the service was very professional very nice they kept us replenished and happy with the drinks and bread my friend packed up her steak to go and the waitress even threw in a couple extra pieces of the pretzel bread for her to go good hangover food for the next morning i was pleased with my experience at cut and kept thoroughly full through the rest of my trip in lv there are a lot of choices when it comes to meat in vegas so i don t know that i ll make my way back here soon but it was a very memorable enough meal
  i definitely would not recommend this buffet price was 15 during dinner which is outrageously expensive because the selection wasn t good for the price and the food tasted terrible there was not one dish that i enjoyed here i had a really hard time enjoying this place it looks and feels dirty flies flying around the food so to summarize expensive bad selection for bad quality dirty i have no idea why some people would rate this place highly they are either associated with buffet asia or they have been fed dog food their whole lives seriously stay away you will regret this place if you go here trust me
  can t say enough about this place i have been here a few times with co workers for lunch and they have great food good beer friendly staff and owner we have also used them for a event and they came through with quality food and service and we are looking forward to using them again
  i ve been wanting to eat here for a couple years now this past wednesday i invited angela to come with me i called the night before and made a reservation for 1900 i asked for the omikase menu and was told they have a 75 and a 100 per person menu people actually opt for the 75 seriously if you re going to go out and eat and do something like this go all out so i chose the 100 it s a 10 course meal i asked if that was enough food and she assured me it would be we came early about 20 minutes early but they had a table for us we got one of their private booths which i m guessing we only got it because we came early oh yeah i possibly should have started this review with saying that this place might be the best japanese restaurant i have ever ever been to i honestly don t remember every single meal we got but it was all amazing i ll list them and discuss what i thought was the best thing we were given grilled cherry tomatoes four different types of sashimi grilled kobe beef grilled pork homemade cold tofu agedashi tofu in broth green tea creme brule cheese cake and a hot pot with kobe beef in a red bean broth the last thing was our 11th course as we still wanted another dish after the 10 though honestly i think we were good and full after the 10 but the food was so good we wanted to try one more dish a lot of their food comes from organic farms this is important because the best thing we had was our grilled pork it s prepared medium yep not fully cooked the waitress told us the pigs are only fed acorns it was god like i couldn t believe pork could taste so good especially cooked medium way better than even the kobe beef the homemade tofu crazy good crazy good the condiments on the table are even amazing they make their own soy sauce and it s the best soy sauce i ve ever had they have some kind of wasabi salt i ve never even heard of such a thing outstanding our last dish the hot pot they gave us two raw eggs i m thinking that we re going to crack these eggs into the broth totally wrong we re told to crack the eggs into our bowls scramble it and then use it as dipping sauce for the food that comes out of the hot pot again the eggs are organic taste was amazing and made complete sense as the broth is really sweet remember it s red bean based so the raw egg totally balances the taste so awesome seriously so awesome and i mean all the food we had was so awesome actually it s awesome if i could i d eat here every week well i promised myself that next time i come here i ll either omikase at the sushi bar or i ll do the kaiseki which you need to make a reservation 3 days in advance for did i mention the word awesome
  they have a really good lunch buffet on weekends i went here on one saturday for lunch i am quite satisfied by the number of dishes and quality of dishes the veg biryani is great the okhra curry is delicious i like that they had pani puri and all the stuff to make pani puris the dosas are nice i would recommend this place as a vegetarian this is a decent place for a nice lunch buffet
  you really really have to watch what you order here in my experience there s been a 75 chance the food will be just short of inedible and a 25 chance it ll be awesome i had bad food twice at the monroeville location here i tried what mad mex calls tortilla soup it was tomato glop then just the other day i tried the gobble rito that was pure bliss i ve been craving it ever since oh the paradox
  it s lovely to have a local wine bar with the selection found here the meals put out by the kitchen are creative and fresh and the business is frequently on groupon and i like getting a deal it s also conveniently located to my work grape street is a wine bar slash restaurant slash wine shop with bottles available for purchase a full menu with hh specials tues fri 3pm 6pm and plenty of featured wines available by the glass bottle and flight monday nights there s even a by the bottle discount the unique whites and syrah flights each include three generous tastings of complementary wines one of the whites was out and they subbed in a sauvignon blanc that was one of the cleanest and most refreshing i ve tasted opted for the baked brie appetizer based on reviews here and though it was cooked correctly and well flavored with carmelized onions and the crunch of hazelnuts the flavors were a little overpowered by the sweetness of the apricot preserves as a snack to go with some wine it worked but flavors were not to my particular fancy several lunch specials available the cream of mushroom soup of the day has an awesome thai twist to the flavor one of the more inventive ones i ve tried and the selection of herbal teas is large i applaud the service here they ve mastered the art of being available but not being overbearing so you are free to have your own conversation with friends and wine without constant interruptions or upselling the bathroom also is quite inventive with a warehouse style sliding door nice decor
  best chinese restaurant in the area the only other place that even compares to this is a good 15 20 minutes away and this place is cheap quick and consistently good tasting the lunch specials are a great deal and it s one of the only chinese places in the area that i haven t had issues with or had to wait 15 minutes for my food after arriving even though i called it in so i will definitely be returning to china palace
  this was my second time at this restaurant and it s been about a calendar year we had a really wonderful dining experience then it was equally good if not better this time around one of the things i really love about this restaurant is the staff they are always very courteous patient and offer really good food wine suggestions the menu was more or less the same as on our last visit but that was fine with us because we ended up revisiting a lot of the same plates the quail clam and artichoke blood pudding scallop and stuffed fig dishes are favorites of ours my boyfriend and i usually order 8 plates and share the tapas at this restaurant are so creative and well presented that other tapas restaurants that we go to pale in comparison we are looking forward to our next annual trip to montreal so we can eat here again
  first time visiting the egg and i and i have no complaints or regrets the entire staff is polite and very inviting special shout out to our server brady he was fabulous and the food was delicious definitely recommend visiting this establishment if you are visiting the area
  its a great value the portions are big and really good my favorite so far is quesadilla mexicaly with chicken and spinach and the burrito san luis of course the table side guacamole is the best i ever had im so coming back to check out the premium margaritas
  the sister restaurant to the egg and i located on sahara blvd but don t expect to see the exact same menu we jump back and forth between the two restaurants depending on what we feel like eating that day fairly standard breakfast combinations of eggs breads and assorted meats so it s hard to go wrong with the food but the definite favorite for me is their banana nut bread which is fresh made at the restaurant and always served piping hot the service is excellent with a lot of the same faces being there for a while now highly recommended for breakfast
  if youre in vegas and you need a fast eat earl is the place to go located in planet hollywood open 24 hours top picks the club and the tuna melt okay the full montagu
  great little place derrick our server was right on and the friend i was with ordered a margarita and it was made fresh amazing the prices are extremely reasonable it s located just on the opposite corner from the mesa arts center so a great spot if you re seeing a show i wish i would have gotten the bartenders name so i could give him credit too but he was tall with dark hair great work on that margarita will be back
  the only good thing about the grind was the staff service the two brothers brought people in making it a place to go 2 3 times a week service beets food any day of the week i recently learned they were let go i will not be back and i will not promote it again i give this place another year now tops
  you can t go wrong with a 3 99 steak and eggs and the steak is not chewy yummmy it s a saturday or sunday tradition
  it s hard to go anything below five stars i ve been here twice and i ll lay it down for everyone the first time was sunday 14 jun 15 for brunch we came in and i m definitely a no mimosa type of man i had a bellini which is a twist on a mimosa with peach schnapps have to say the cocktail had excellent balance with brewery attached to your name i expected the perch to offer their own beers because i didn t see them on the list of taps more on that later from the very beginning the waitress was on point she knew exactly where to go with a brunch cocktail in suggesting the bellini for the lady of course she was going to have a mimosa she also ordered the french toast which to be honest we should have shared because there were eight slices of texas toast or so it appeared to my hungry eyes i ordered the huevos percheros a play on huevos rancheros i have to say the fried tortilla black refried beans fried egg and green chile amazing and honestly it was light and if i did not have to skedaddle and was able to dawdle a bit we may have ordered another cocktail and something else to scarf down as i had said the waitress was there at the key moments asking about our food filling our water and inquiring about our stay i had tried to figure out if the perch actually brewed their own beer and could find anything based on their website but their instagram had some clues i posted on their facebook and i had a great response within a few hours and would be on the hunt for perch beer the next time we dined there great social media engagement now let s get to last night we had meant to go to bourbon jacks because i had read some good stuff but as their music was about to start there was no place to sit and eat so she and i audibled which was the best of choices we were promptly sat and a waiter appeared swiftly awesome attitude i must say so i ordered the irish red and she ordered the orange heffeweisen my baseline for an irish red is killians so i was pleasantly surprised with their twist on it we then ordered and split the fish tacos she was like it better not be fishy but she totally enjoyed the tacos i ordered my second beer which was the perch peach my baseline for a peach beer is the lambic peche so it was a bit offputting at the bitterness and strength of the perch rendition it s scent was on point and the taste although a surprise it remained pleasant as we shared the cookie dough rolls if anything could make you feel as if you were in heaven whoever manages the perch they certainly know the sorts of personalities to hire every employee interaction we had there was the model every restaurant should aspire to
  excellent excellent excellet we moved to las vegas 6 months ago and last night our meal at the pasta pirate was by far the best since we got here the value of food the taste the service everything i ordered the cioppino 20 and it was the best i ever had shout out to the cook whom i got to see prepare my meal through the glass window you also get a glass of wine with your meal along with soup or salad this is the best restaurant downtown and beyond
  tacos were good but like someone else said mexican food made by real mexican s i expected their tacos to be even better than what they were they got the food out super fast which was a considering we were on a time crunch they are really expensive for tacos though almost 30 for 2 people to order 3 tacos and 2 drinks no tiny taco should be 3 maybe visit the la taco trucks for ideas
  simply put this place is sinfully delicious great price for a vegas buffet and tons of variety i especially love the dessert options
  back again still thinking about the flatbread pizza w tandoori chicken i told my friend not to order it as an appetizer b c i felt it would be too much food intake one of the best things i ve eaten in a while i can t wait to order that as my main dish next time soooooo good you gotta try it the chutney and all the flavor combinations were perfect it didn t sound so special on the menu but it is
  very generic fare bartender too friendly lots of tvs
  i have visited this location twice via drive thru each time the team member taking my order sounds unhappy the second visit our fries were cold and stale and our order was wrong i have switched to a different mcdonalds location
  had areally fun time here with a big group after spring training big long tables in thse bar are great for big groups simple menu worked for vegetarians in our group too sangria was so so but that s what i get for ordering it when i should have had a margarita
  we dined at anthony s on christmas day evening so perhaps our visit was not representative however we didn t think our meal was deserving of the high marks that have been described here positives we were greeting by a friendly host and immediately escorted to a nice table in the rear of the restaurant even though there were many waiting for tables our reservation was honored no problem nice space modern and tasteful wine was 1 3 off nice surprise for christmas soups lobster bisque and chowder were superb sadly this was the best part of the meal so so sides were ok had the green beans and much lauded cream corn the corn was good but not the best in the world experience that some have expressed here waiter was somewhat distant seemed preoccupied perhaps he didn t want to be working the holiday only warmed up at the very end when presenting the check negatives meal was rushed our starters soups were delivered to the table literally 3 minutes after the waiter left the table even before he could bring our bottle of wine i can only guess that he entered the order in their system and the kitchen runner immediately brought it out we both ordered steaks bone in ribeye and bone in filet both were cooked perfectly but strangely the ribeye was room temperature i still cant figure that one out you d think they had grilled up steaks in advance and just had them sitting waiting to be ordered by someone not a good value strip prices but falls short of a fine dining experience given the prices here not willing to give them a second chance probably will not return
  hash house a no go sadly the opportunity in this menu is lost on cooks and servers who haven t yet found the pleasure in preparing excellent food for people poor timing of a table s meals arriving a pastyness to the scrambled eggs runny oatmeal dry biscuits incorrect orders and more
  been going to this place for years the lunch buffet is far superior to anything offered by china china or jimmy chungs staff a pretty miserable lot at lunchtimes though but it being a buffet you don t have to interact with them a great deal
  rudy s is great for both breakfast and lunch they serve breakfast tacos until 10am everyday but if you come after that there will still be some left on the heater i love their sides but their potato salad is some of the best ever they also have great banana and chocolate pudding that you can take to go if you fill up on too much bbq the customer service is great and they will let you sample meats if it s your first time they have paper towel rolls at all the tables but they also have a sink in the dining room to wash your hands in i feel like i m back in texas when i eat at rudy s
  i have been to grit grace quite a few times the first 2 3 times was amazing but it has sadly gone down hill from there i truly enjoy the atmosphere and the food but that s where it stops the last 2 visits i have made i had the same waiter the same waiter who tried many times to take my food give me a bill when we still had food coming never refilled our water never asked if we wanted additional drinks never asked if we wanted more food both times we hadn t even gotten our drinks and he s trying to give us the bill we had just ordered food from him and drinks yet he wanted to give us our bill he made our experience horrendous if the place had been packed i would have completely understood but there were 4 other small 4 and under groups in the restaurant during our last 2 visits oh and we don t know our waiters name he never told us i was truly disappointed this was my favorite restaurant when it opened but the service has gone downhill i m not sure when i will go back i am sure i will give them another chance i mean you can t beat those pork belly bites but service wise i m not so sure they only got 3 stars due to initial positive experiences
  great food for low price try the italian beef sandwich and you gotta have the fries when i first wanted to try it my boyfriend said it was going to be awful but once we went inside and tried their food he change his mind and said i am coming here more often this place is just what arizona needed an east coast taste arizona needs more of the east coast food over here
  wow this tiny neighborhood joint in the middle of the camelback esplanade getting rave reviews and for good reason great prices interesting and fantastic tasting food friendly attentive service what more could you ask always good not a bad dish on the menu have tried 6 7 dishes fresh fish changes almost daily and is a super bargain at current rate of 17 yeah 17 bux the pork shoulder tonite was to die for finish the meal with a robust french press coffee say hello to jeff the owner and chef it s getting crowded though you might need a reservation
  wow good not to diminish the chicken but the french fries are out of this world hardest choice in ordering is what type of sauce for your wings and fingers there are so many choices
  best in town let s go all around the world you will find every ingredient you want for cooking and much more it is one of my favorite places here in town
  i really don t have anything bad to say about my experience here i went last night to have a quiet evening celebrating my best friends birthday we were waited on by thomas and he was superb i went here a few weeks ago just to get dessert and he was my waiter then as well it took awhile for him to come to us in the beginning but once you see how hands on he is with everything that goes into your meal it is understandable and acceptable especially when there are many decisions to make regarding the menu dinner was fantastic we had the wisconsin trio salads a pacific rim and classic entree and the classic chocolate peanut butter dessert this is the perfect place when you want to sit and talk and have a nice discussion because you feel like you are in your own little room with that being said make sure you like the people you go with because it can be up to a 3 hour affair depending on your own pace we stayed for about 3 hours and greatly enjoyed the experience
  eddie d s is hidden in a strip mall parking lot near steiners starting going here with my little sister months ago this little joint packs a mean punch when it comes to their sandwiches the staff is friendly could talk for hours if you wanted
  amazing don t let the outside or location deter you from entering this place is a gem server was on point very attentive and polite the bread was fresh and the herb butter was extra nice i ordered the clam linguini which was overflowing with clams the white sauce was light and tasty if i lived in arizona i would come here again and again really sad that i have to leave
  i think some of the negative reviews here are unrealistic let s face it if you are eating here you are trapped in airside c waiting for a flight you have no other real choices except fast food the place is going to be busy and the patrons are always in a hurry welcome to an airport restaurant and by the way the plastic utensils are required in an airside for security reasons i had lunch and thought the food was good and the service was attentive the prices are hight but again you are in an airport i had a better experience than i expected so i think 3 stars is appropriate
  what can i say mostly everything here is housemade and to die for its some seriously unhealthy southern diner food but my oh my it is delicious the only caviot is that the hurricanes and other drinks don t seem near as strong as they used to
  i was walking around downtown an happened upon this place by mistake this small place has plenty of seating and the server was very nice i got egg rolls and a lunch portion of chicken fried rice they ask how spicy you want the rice i asked for mild and it was a bit more than i would like but the overall flavor and combination was great with the lunch i also got a small green salad i didn t eat i m not a salad person and it came with a fried wonton on the top crab maybe but it s fairly priced for the egg rolls small salad and a huge chicken fried rice was like 14 00 i recommend this place over any of the downtown chinese buffets clean wasn t crowded and nice servers enjoy
  great food good service the hosts and hostess s are another story they just aren t super friendly or welcoming its very odd and uncomfortable and it makes for a very awkward start to what is supposed to be a nice experience it won t stop us from coming back but i m hoping the owners do something to change this as i see i am not the only patron making that complaint otherwise i d be giving it 5 stars
  was here before and the service was terrible stopped in tonight for a beer and a water and omg the h2o tasted like it could have come from tempe town lake never understand why bars can t spend 100 on a water filter clean water makes a big difference
  came here with my bf best mexican style restaurant food yet in vegas we got seated right away we got our food right away and our cups stayed full great service great food happy customer definetely coming back strongly recommended
  always come here for special occasions generally for the brunch morning views of camelback are spectacular the buns and bread basket are great you get several choices of eggs benedict regular veggie smoked salmon lobster or filet very filling and delicious the breakfast menu is diverse however with many choices reliable delicious and well worth it
  pretty good would give it a 5 if the fish didn t taste bland and my girl friends steak had way to much fat on the prime rib
  it wasn t as good as i remember we used to come here a lot as a family back about 10 years ago but today it was not nearly as close as it used to be the girl that works here obviously hates her job the breadsticks are so soggy and their menu is not as big as it used to be the one boy that s works there is a great worker though and he earned most of the stars lol
  this place does not mess around in addition to being an absolutely top notch steak house with amazingly good service they always have items on and off the menu that will make you happy even if you aren t in the mood for steak on the night i was there they had stone crab claws and some other items you will never find on a competitor s menu 100 legit i think this is my favorite steakhouse of them all no joke
  i went here by accident because i was so hungry i couldn t think straight but it turned out well i had come out of a long meeting and was just in a low blood sugar muddle i planned to go to blue bear but there were lots of people coming in and out and i somehow wandered into circle i m really not good when i need food anyway there i was and i immediately felt better i like the feel of the place nice and chilled and cool and calm the waitress was lovely when i couldn t decide what i wanted and the tea came in a pot and was delicious my scone was disappointing though more of a roll light and bready i like a scone with a bit of heft to it especially when i m hungry but yes nice place free wifi good tea patient staff
  in the area hanging with a friend in the mood for chinese food found this little family spot the service was excellent hong was very nice the food was good reasonable prices nice neat and clean dining area i would recommend this to others and i would definitely come again
  this place is great honestly staff is great the chicken noddle soup is deliciouse the cinnomon bread and fudge is awesome u can stay here as longas u can keep requesting everything u want with no extra charge at all its awesome
  waited 2 hours for a delivery i called and at first they could not find my order then they apologized and told me my pizza would be in shortly and they would give me a credit for next time well there will be no next time i think waiting for 2 hours for a pizza was too much
  friendly environment and great food
  i feel bad ripping on a place located in uptown i mean with all the disadvantages of placing a restaurant in this town high overhead rent stiff competition etc it s a wonder we don t only have mcdonalds and burger king duking it out in the overstreet mall that is why i was so excited to see an original sandwichery my word look for it in webster s next years edition open up in the mall when you think of brad s think quiznos minus the good bread choices and creative sandwiches sure brad s throws their subs through the conveyor toaster whoop de doo when i saw they only offered two bread choices white or wheat i actually got excited here i was thinking that a sandwich shop that only offers two bread choices must bake their bread in house thus restricting them from getting too wild and crazy um the dude took my roll out of a bag and it wasn t even a good bagged roll the level of meat and cheese on the sandwhich was sparse at best 10 for a subpar 8 inch sub chips and fountain drink is pricey even taking into consideration the uptown location ri ra s sandwich shop down the street will do you better but even they aren t that good back to the sandwich drawing board
  soo goood
  eh this place is so so i think i am pretty bias though since i have been a fan of a particular hawaiian place since college the saimin soup is a 3 star spam misubi is a 3 5 star the beef teri is 3 star nothing that really stuck out to me but it is overall a decent place and affordable
  this restaurant can do no wrong in my opinion great happy hour nice ambiance and a great staff i ve been here a few times and i always order the mac cheese which is hands down the best i ve ever had i can t come here without ordering it if you love mac cheese like i do or even if you aren t a big fan of it come here to have your tastebuds blown away
  i love this place i don t live near it but when i am in the area i have to stop by they have a great wine selection the food is great cheese plate and the staff is very friendly and is well versed in the wines they carry it can get pricey if you start drinking more wine than you ought to be if you are driving so be wary of that but they do have a good happy hour price on wines and such i highly recommend this place
  i have honestly never had a bad meal here i believe they have some of if not the best prices in town the restaurant itself is very clean with dim lighting and lots of booths along with a great bar area the food is always cooked perfectly i love the new york steak or the filet and salmon combo did i mention how great their prices are i also love their grits and the fact that they have a lot of great wines by the glass which is great for me because hubby doesn t drink they often have live music service is always great too we especially like one server who we tend to get a lot i believe her name is sarah she s very attentive and friendly next time you are choosing between some stuffy uptown or south park steakhouse i urge you to consider this place instead
  since we have a residence nearby we decided to try bella notte we all thought the food was good but not great i can t put my finger on what is missing but maybe it s just a lack of creativity the owners with deep italian accents certainly provide an authentic aura but i would have hoped for a little more in regards to the food the service was fine and they were quite attentive we will definitely give them another shot
  i came here today because i was in the area and figured it was time to try some capriotti s it was my first time eating their sandwiches so i figured what the heck i ll give them a shot the menu has tons of options and they have a few different sized subs 9 inches being the smallest that s pretty darned big i went with a 9 inch slaw be jo and it came with meat russian dressing coleslaw mayo and roast beef the sandwich itself was okay but i felt like it was missing something it tasted kind of dry i wanted to ask for more dressing but after about getting half way through i figured decided not to i think the sandwich needs to come with some kind of dressing prefereably italian it came across as somewhat dry overall prices were a okay 6 99 for the sandwich 1 59 for drinks plus some tax and the total was 9 35 not bad i will say i wasn t impressed overall but it wasn t the worst sandwich i had i feel like there s other sandwich shops in the area that serve similar but better sandwiches that might be worth trying before hitting up this place
  ok so i ve been here a go zillian times this review is just a formality this place is great the food is consistently good extremely affordable with the portion sizes in fact i usually end up taking half of my meal home with me for lunch the next day i have loved everything i ve eaten here the salads the pizza the veggie wedgie which i repeatedly order when i should be trying something new the artichoke lasagna and the pizza cookie there are few things worth blowing the calories for this is one of them can i also mention how the service is so friendly every single time you go these people are great and they make you keep wanting to come back we eat here frequently and every out of town guest gets a trip to oreganos so far no one has been disappointed thanks guys
  i love that they re open late often 2 or 3 am but the food has just been so so the last couple of times i went i think the tacos at round corner cantina are far superior to these and the burritos here are sub par too decent if you need a late night snack but not worth going out of your way for
  it s been some time since i ve been in va bene so i grabbed a groupon and dropped in on a sunday evening for dinner in the bar my first impression was pleasant there wasn t a plethora of cougars sitting around the bar ready to pounce ordered a bottle of wine and michelle suggested a dish that wasn t on the menu that would pair well with the wine it was fabulous great dinner with fabulous service
  not interesting enough to be a good dive bar and the food bar selection wasn t good enough to warrant a repeat visit went for some wings and beer on a saturday evening the wings were standard bar wings they had that chicken skin smell a raw chicken has although they were cooked through probably just not super fresh draft beer selection was a half notch above standard domestics with blue moon and newcastle being the top shelf waitress was cool and didn t fuss over us asking for a couple of extra ranch dressings the oddest dynamic of this bar lounge was the crowd it was primarily teenagers and 50ish bar fly s on the slots with a few families interspersed
  this place is amazing i had the breakfast burrito which was delicious the eggs were perfectly light and fluffy i don t even usually eat eggs but these i d eat all day long i added the chorizo to it the first one didn t have chorizo in it but when they asked i told them it was missing and they made me a new one with absolutely no issues or fuss it was amazing service everyone there was really friendly and didn t mind answering any questions we had
  stopped here for fries half regular half sweet potato on the way back to our hotel room at aria huge servings quick service fresh food delicious flavor great dipping sauces included like chipotle mayo and honey mustard
  this place is horribly managed by a bunch of baboons they can t tell their right from their left i saw my waiter about 2 3 times the whole 2 hours i was there they have horrible service i had to wait for about 45 minutes to get my food wtf it s only soup noodles and soup we had talked to the manager about the horrible service and she did not do anything to compensate us but instead told us a list of excuses it was also noticed that other parties were experiencing the same horrible service as we were besides the horrid service the food was decent at best prices were very expensive for food that is so simple to make overall this place made treasure island look very bad for lack of customer service if you don t want to risk waiting a long time for food i would advise you to go elsewhere
  it s not like i can tell if their boba is really better than any other places but fresh cup definitely has some things going for it friendly staff clean and respectable looking dining area free wi fi and all the k pop posters and ktv on all the screens this stuff kills me the fashion the songs the 40 person singing groups definitely nothing i normally watch so it s a great way to pass the time while they re making your drink it s all just soooo welcoming and kind of makes you want to stay a while unlike most boba joints in town great place to shoot the breeze when it s 108 degrees out
  the decor and ambiance of the restaurant was excellent inviting and a place to relax the food selection doesn t seem like there are many options but as you read through the menu there are actually quite a few had the bison burger with the kale brussels slaw the quality of the food combined with the taste was superb pricing is very reasonable and not over priced service and friendliness of staff was great
  i eat at robertos 8 30 in the morning the only thing i eat by 11 30 that day i was very ill tryed to call nobody returned my call still very sick the next day i called the general manager he was very rude blamed me said they got no report of anybody else getting sick the store would not reyurn my call how could you know if anybody was sick if you don t return calls his name is ronldo finally the manager of the store on vegas and rainbow called me back
  hands down the best greek in town quick service always great food whether you dine in or take out clean and modern atmosphere one of my favorites the scottsdale location is amazing too
  very delicious you won t miss the meat the singapore tofu rocked everything smelled great and the service was wonderful i will be back with the vegetarian children
  my bf and i went there last night to celebrate my new job boy were we glad we did we started off with drinks i had a retail therapy and he had their manhattan gotta say two of the best drinks we ve ever had delish and dangerous my bf called them panty droppers lol we had oysters and they were awesome i had the 8oz filet and bf had the 18oz bone in rib eye both were cooked to perfection we also had the roasted brussel sprouts with bacon super yummy our server was bradley it was his 6th day but you d never know it excellent server looked like a young steve buscemi seriously could play him in younger days we had a weird moment with diners sitting behind us as they proceeded to talk to us after they had quite a few cocktails but it didn t ruin the night just made for a funny story
  really cool concept but nothing too original here in pittsburgh there are bars condos concert venues etc that were all once churches the beer is great get the munk dunkel skip the mole stout and you can take home a pony too
  phenomenal lunch went in with a restaurant com certificate and prices weren t bad had chile verde which was tangy and had just the right amount of spice queso and guacamole appetizers california chicken enchiladas steak tacos and chicken quesadillas all were great and the service was the best we ve had in a long time only bad part of the meal is that i m stuffed
  don t know what would make it any better great sandwich they make the steak almost right in front of you it taste great they have cheese wizz but it isn t on the menu great
  hash house is a unique place with food mainly unlike other restaurants huge portions with generous use of quality ingredients keep me coming back i love their breakfast skillets and burgers both loaded with avocado
  quite possibly the best taco i have ever had in my life cannot wait to get back to vegas to have another
  wow happy hour from 4 10 pm everyday who s heard of that while the location is downtown and deserted on sunday night when we went the bartender was great and very attentive i live guinness so for 4 pint you can t beat it the appetizers are also very tasty and 1 2 off we have been to the one in hawaii which is old and only has happy hour from 4 7 so this is great i would definitely go back
  from the service to the food everything was fantastic we started off with the crab cakes for an appetizer along with the godzilla roll crab cakes were fantastic sushi roll was 20 but a fairly larger portion i got the mahi mahi it was to die for a burst of flavor it had hints of pecan and cinnamon on a bed of shrimp rice my friend got the apple sandwich that came on pita very good great for a tasty lunch we finished off with the tiramisu shooter and the chocolate cake everything was excellent we will definitely be back next time we spend our day in dt summerlin
  i went to this restaurant about a month ago with my fiance and was very pleased i am gfcf and have a few other miscellaneous food intolerances and the staff were very knowledgeable and helpful the food was very good and healthy my fiance who is not gfcf really enjoyed his food so don t let the allergen avoidance culture if you don t need to eat that way i m sure you ll find something you like on the menu
  if you are vegetarian coz you actually like veggies this is the place for you you can actually taste the vegetables and the food is fantastic it rivals true foods and is priced much better sasha is such a friendly person loved talking to her and if you cant tolerate vegetables and have given up hope this is the place for you they actually promote local organic and healthy eating they conduct events like classes from time to time i have had the pleasure of attending a class as well http livingthegradlife com 2013 09 18 cooking with sasha of 24 carrots amazing food and philosophy
  i had the veggie burrito and it was amazing what sets them aside from places like m4 burrito is the flavour they use a mexican cream and cheese that adds that nice little touch the veggies were grilled and flavoured perfectly the counterman was more than happy to explain their processes ie how they make their horchata and jamaica the only downside he probably made my burrito a little too big good price service and food i ll probably go back this week they were also offering a discount to clients that worked or lived in the area
  i postponed writing my review of tortas paquime i july since it was my first visit and our experience was 2 5 stars today s visit brought them up to a 3 star rating the good they use very fresh ingredients their tortas and variety of postres are very good they offer a soup of the day the service is friendly and they are fairly quick to make your order their prices are very reasonable and cheaper than most other places that offer the same menu options the not so good their aguas frescas are not made fresh to order and tasted very watered down the tortas are very good however their tacos volteados was more of a melted cheesy tacos than a shredded pork tacos they were also a too greasy the bad we had to sit on the side of the restaurant that has the tv and it was too loud it was playing some kind of mexican comedy that was not appropriate for the children to watch that were dinning at the time it was also very hot in in the restaurant i will blame that on the arizona heat
  really enjoyed our meal at olive ivy we tried the sangria which was good but not great i d definitely try something else if i went again but it was totally drinkable bacon wrapped dates were amazing so good the bread pesto dip is as good as everyone else on yelp says i had the sea bass which was delish and my husband s scallops were great too his corn mixture under the scallops was the best part i think to finish we had the ice cream bar dessert how can you go wrong with caramel ice cream marshmallow peanut butter and magic shell topping so tasty the atmosphere was great very classy and hip but casual at the same time our server was great fabulous sense of humor and made us feel very welcome there overall a great experience
  so happy to have a pita jungle in ahwatukee went yesterday tuesday and it was very busy for a late lunch crowd great view of south mountain from the patio we went during happy hour they have tapas for 1 2 and 3 dollars speaking my frugal language the tomato mozzarella fresh and tasty small but perfect for starters i normally order the fruit and cheese plate served as a meal but we order as an appetizer then i get the pita pizza perfect for kids or for someone that has devoured half a cheese and fruit platter on her own for my husbands birthday they let us bring in a cake most restaurants will not allow at all or will charge a plate serving fee no singing they are not that kind of restaurant my husband would have divorced me if people came out singing and clapping happy happy birthday to our guest great experience love the eclectic decor
  i ve had echo rig book marked as a place to try on my yelp for awhile and we finally gave it a try today came here for lunch and there was no wait the layout of the restaurant is nice downstairs is the butcher shop area the reception and a bar upstairs is the actual dining area where there is indoor and outdoor seating i like how it s very spacious and airy upstairs the service we got was great our servers were nice and just attentive enough now on to the food my friend and i ordered sweet first cauliflower tasty just had the right amount of crunch and saltiness to it we really liked how the sliced chilis complimented the cauliflower bone marrow asada a ok one of the toasts we got was burnt on the end boo to them for not replacing it this was the first time i ve had this type of dish before i saw the pictures on yelp of others raving about the dish but overall it was just ok not worth a repeat order black spaghetti my main dish not quite what i was expecting the broth was a bit too tangy for me pasta itself as well as the seafood which was shrimp calamari and mussels was not bad but i was disappointed overall won t be order this again trenne pasta this was my friend s dish much tastier than mine i had no clue what trenne pasta is and therefore did not know it was suppose to be a crunchy texture i didn t care for the crunchiness of the pasta but i did like the prime rib eye and tuscan black kale that was part of the dish overall i would go back the prices are overall are reasonable staff was nice and the restaurant itself is lovely next time i will order some kind of steak that will be the make it or break it deal of whether or not i will make future repeat visits
  this is one of madison s best noodle joints the buns are always good it s a toss up between the pork or beef buns in the dumplings i prefer the pork dumplings over the other varieties i think i ve sampled most of the raman but prefer something with pork in it the salads are also nice but given the near zero temp it was definitely a noodle night we split the special of course it had a nice slab of pork belly as one of the protein components we also had an order of the spicy beef buns and an order of the pork dumplings the bill was 30 not bad for two
  can t do animals can t do dairy yet am a food warrior indeed madison abounds with options for a gal like me but monty s marks my favorite eatery in the city intentionally old school in its decor and prices it s a throwback that appeals to anyone with a frontal cortex my waitress brought me a gratis cup of the home made veg soup as i was sitting at the end of the counter an she hadn t seen me for a few minutes aaaaand the tip started to go up i had the meatless meatloaf thing also mentioned here and good lord the portion size was outta control the roll was the size of a yorkshire pudding and the mashed potatoes were actually made of potato fancy that the meatless loaf itself was solidly good shredded root veg with a cheesy binder wish i had known that prior to ordering but should ve asked but a bit oily and the cashew gravy was goooood so many great looking options for veg heads like myself hallelujah a men and they even have a small wine list and beer i couldn t get through the entire pile of food despite being a hormonal food warrior that day yet i craved a sweet and monty s has soy ice cream wtf other diners i nearly wept at this one i had the mint chip 2 scoops which again were more like two grapefruit spilling over the sides of the bowl that i could do my total bill came to 8 eight i added a 50 tip and blew monty s a kiss as i left i shall return waitress was a sweetie the staff all seemed to be pretty happy and the place was approaching fullness when i left my fondness for monty s justifies the caps
  ive ate here twice for breakfast and about 4times for lunch food is great and prices are good great chef salads blt chicken salad plate great sides breakfast and sweet tea i love when i work in the area and can eat here great little diner
  i was so excited to try this place this area lacks charming locally owned restaurants so i try to support the ones here whenever i can i have been following their facebook posts but never saw an official we are open announcement so it wasn t till yelp reviews started popping up that i realized i could go we went on a thursday night there was not a long line for the drive thru so we were able to get in and out pretty fast here is what we had 3 chicken tacos chips and salsa croquettas and 2 veggie tacos it totalled maybe 16 dollars not a bad price at all i was full too so i have no complaints on the portion size i mean i could have eaten more but its best i didn t anyways i thoroughly enjoyed the croquettas they were freshly friend and very tasty i liked the dipping sauce too the spicy inferno salsa was also pleasantly spicy with a good flavor most places advertise that it is spicy but it is never spicy enough for my husband so he was pleasantly surprised that this actually had a little spice he could always use more spice though he likes to cry when he eats his food the tacos on the other hand were not that great they were just ok the chicken tacos just seemed a little plane with only chicken and pico and sparse cheese he really was not happy with the tacos they were just kind of boring they were also in a floppy flour tortilla it did not really add anything we would have preferred corn tortillas for the street taco experience my veggie tacos were ok too i think i enjoyed them a little more than my husband but its not something i would go back for so all in all it was good not the best the service was fine no complaints i will give it another shot in a few months and see again
  this review is for their lunch buffet i came in around 1pm after a day at the korean spa they are open from 11 30pm 2 30pm for lunch and then reopen at 5pm for dinner yet again i almost missed out on a solid place because i was going to walk out first glances can be deceptive especially when you walk into an empty restaurant in the middle of lunch hours i decided to stay anyways due to all the high reviews of this place i cannot say that yelp has lead me astray the lunch buffet is smaller than other restaurants and does not offer saag i was disappointed to see that their paneer is without the homemade cheese cubes i did enjoy their butter chicken and aloo gobi though in the beginning i was counting all of my favorite items that was missing but after a few bites i was enjoying what they did offer unlike other places the items in the warmers were kept piping hot nothing was lukewarm the fried potatoes retained a crispiness that is normally unheard of in buffets overall i was impressed with how attentive the owner was she cleared plates refilled my water and checked up on me frequently i overheard her conversation about the restaurant having a tough time but she doesn t let it show in the quality of the food i hope their business picks up because it is a solid option for those not too familiar with indian or someone who loves butter chicken which i don t see too often on the line
  i ve been to this place only when art walk takes place i get lost in their library of conspiracy literature coffee is good but with so many people bouncing into you makes it no fun will have to return when it is a regular day
  i get food here from the drive thru about once a week on my way home from work and the food is good and priced right imo i would definitely recommend
  it s really good overall i like their appetizers and beef i used to love beef tongues but their beef tongues are too thick for me
  this place sucks we got a 25 gift certificate from the hotel to go here and it was still awful we got two drinks i ordered mac n cheese and he ordered fried chicken the portions were huge and we still ended up paying over 40 wtf also it took 20 minutes for our waitress to even sort of notice us we weren t going to tip her until our bill came and they d conveniently added 18 gratuity for us what the hell she deserved nothing she was horrible they were all horrible the service is the slowest most awful service ever especially considering how expensive the place is do not go here stay away from this place
  after a few nights in vegas with nothing but disappointments thanks alot bellagio roy s was a much needed positive to our trip we made a reservation for 8 45 pm this past sunday but of course the bellagio burned us not the first time roy s posted closing time is 9 00 pm but we called and they offered to stay open for us until 9 15 pm outstanding who does that anyways we arrive at 9 15 pm exactly and they gave us a table the service was top notch very friendly and the waiter was even happy to stay open for us that is not common of most places after closing time i ordered the thai chicken it was excellent the meat slipped right off the bone not sure what the sauce was it came with but dang it was great my better half ordered the salmon it came out looking like something out of a magazine spectacular all around this was one of the most positive facilities we visited during our 4 day stay in vegas
  first time eating here but i hear a lot about it i ordered the big cheese burger which came with two patties instead of 2 added some good toppings and instead of regular i got the cajun fries the burger was delicious i finished it before i got back to the house the fries could ve stayed at the restaurant they were not really good the burger two thumbs up the place was clean and the staff was friendly and for that it earned this place 4 stars the fries are the reason for the missing star the place is called five guys burgers and fries i just wish the fries were as good if not better than the burger
  made a reservation on opentable for friday at 6pm it wasn t packed at all but the hostess decided to sit us outside without asking where we d prefer to sit it was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable i immediately noticed that a lot of cmu undergrads worked there while i was dining there i saw 3 cmu classmates i started off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty we were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread the spread was ok for the entrees i got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausage for the cavereccia i thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but i was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces the pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok the cavatelli was extremely oily the more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in i had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta lastly i had the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding it was pretty good but i wish there were more raspberries in it service was pretty good and the decor outside was nice although it got really stuffy in the outdoor tent this place is pretty expensive and based on the food i wouldn t go back for that price
  came here for drinks snacks on a friday around noon the place was dark and had way too much empty space we had a group of 8 so we ordered the party platter which is a ridiculous amount of food for 40 everything was way too greasy while the meat was ironically pretty dry i also got the margarita which came in a huge fishbowl sized glass and was plenty strong so come for the drinks get food elsewhere
  i ate at this location once at 1am while in vegas i ordered a single animal style and well done fries plain on this visit the burger was good and fresh the well done fries upon first taste we good it dawned on me that even though i had ordered well done fries on my last visit that clearly they were not well done these were extremely crispy and oily and it was a little too much for me the food came out in about 10 minutes and it was all piping hot if someone were to try to compare both five guys and in n out i think that by far this locations close proximity to five guys would make for an excellent head to head comparison unfortunately i lack the stomach and the time to do that
  went to rufus on the thursday night before the august long weekend it had been recommended to us by a local montrealer at first the girl who greeted us could not find out reservation for 8 the bartender stepped in to help us and we were seated it took about 20 mins for our server the original girl to take our drink order and we should have assessed that that was a good indication of the poor service that would follow i don t know if it was because we are anglo and this area of town little burgundy grifftintown is predominantly franco but she was slow to help us rude and kept ignoring our requests for drinks water napkins etc at one point my husband walked up to her in the restaurant and asked politely if she could come over as we all wanted to order more drinks at which point she proceeded to have a 10 15 min conversation with some guys sitting at the bar i was in awe i must say though the food was very yummy it seems that they change their menu periodically when we went it was a take on japanese street food the soba noodles were extremely flavourful agedashi tofu yum and who doesn t love dumplings cocktails were pricey 14 range i ordered a margarita and it was straight up but not over ice the decor leaves much to the imagination let s just say it looks better under candlelight
  we brought our one year old sat outside and received amazing food and great service really like this place
  note 5 stars for fast food joint not the capital grill this subway experience was fast accurate and no fuss 1 21 11 this subway is busy and efficient i enjoyed an excellent turkey sub add bacon with an assortment of toppings and they made it with excellent fresh ingredients if you need a meal fast and on the cheap you can t beat this i was in and out fast during a busy lunch rush
  when i moved to charlotte from ohio four years ago i prayed for the day they d open a chipotle down here it pains me to admit it but before there were any in charlotte i did drive to the one by hanes mall in greensboro to get my fix yikes i know right aside from the food being great uhh obviously if i m willing to drive 2 hours for it everyone at this location is super friendly i had only been in there two or three times for lunch when the staff recognized me as a familiar face they re very accommodating and in stark contrast to the employees at several other quick restaurants they seem genuinely happy to be making you great food and to be working together i ve since turned several friends and co workers on to this location as it s convenient and quick for many of us during the work week lunch hour as with any chipotle location if you need to get in and out quickly you can call or fax your order in so it s ready when you arrive or if you re feeling really fancy you can order and pay using their online order tool or their iphone app and just grab your food and run at first i worried about the accuracy of this method but not once have they messed up my order or had me wait for it when i got there my favorite from this restaurant steak burrito with black beans corn salsa sour cream and cheese with a side of chips and guacamole their guacamole is absolutely delicious but does cost 1 80 extra on your burrito but is so worth it
  i love this place solid food and service i feel like i need to write a long review but that about sums it up
  not very good at all i stayed at the hotel and that was a great experience i was really looking forward to the buffet i knew it wasn t going to be 4 star dining but i expected more out of this place it didn t have the greatest selection and the food had no flavor i would never go back please take my word for it don t try the sushi
  such an adorable spot if you re in the area and need a beautiful hangout to look at flowers walk around the vegetable farm and grab a bite to eat there s an organic farm on the property and the tea and lemonade are self serve the only main issue is that arizona is hot and everything is outdoors in addition there were lots of flies so everyone was swatting them with their menu at the same time people willing to overcome both of those issues must love the spot very cute would definitely recommend it to anyone near the airport
  24 different types of good beer on tap order your beer in a 33 oz stein and watch yourself get supperrrrr drunk if you ve been drinking already like i was i ended up getting too drunk to finish my beer our lovely bartender handed me a plastic cup and i took the rest of my beer to go after all you are in vegas and wasting alcohol is blasphemy i love the decor and vibe of this pub service was impeccable from what i remembered
  food is good but service is horrible called in our order still waited 35 mins my entire lunch break was wasted waiting all of the dine in orders that came in after us were served first
  i had breakfast at stewart and ogden two mornings in a row in part because we were lazy but mostly because we didn t know we had a 10 discount on the first go round so had to come back this restaurant is located inside the new downtown grand hotel it s small but it has character the breakfasts are decent and reasonably priced for a hotel breakfast and the staff was friendly the first day i had a standard eggs and bacon and toast breakfast and it was all fine the bacon was particularly good but the toast was cold and you have to put your own butter on and you know how butter on cold toast works out bummer the second day i got the lemon ricotta waffles and oddly it was also cool temperature wise not sure what s up with not serving the food hot could be a server issue or the kitchen but it was disappointing both had good flavor the waffles came covered in blueberries and other berries kind of half fresh and half sort of a compote a little odd but not bad my husband had the big breakfast with eggs bacon potatoes and pancakes the first day which he enjoyed and the ranchero scramble the next day which seemed kind of small but that he said tasted good he did not complain about the temperature of his food but he ll eat anything overall i d eat here if i m staying at the grand but i doubt i d make a special trip to eat here
  i love it here the staff is friendly and attentive homey feel not stuffy the food is always skillfully crafted and delicious decent wine selection with fair pricing full bar tonight makers manhattan desserts they look good but i m always too full kind of old school las vegas with local charm
  27 7 for bottomless mimosas and bloody marys wow this place is insane actually not the absolute best brunch i ve been to but it s a close second this place definitely wins the prize for presentation many servings are in super cute single serving containers white ramekins squared off asian style fingerbowls mini frybaskets and wax paper for the chicken mini takeout boxes for the asian noodle salad etc it really stepped the food up don t miss 1 the french toast perfectly light and fluffy on warm brioche yum 2 the mac and cheese w truffle oil 3 the pecan tart 4 the tiramisu ice cream 5 the bloody mary thin but actually really good i had the bacon summer sausage made to order omelette ravioli gnocchi lamb and asian noodle salad as well all very good good experience i d come back
  the voodoo rooms is always a pleasure to visit even without a room full of yelpers to keep you company it s beautiful decor and it s fantastic selection of drinks really do make for a great night out it s not somewhere i d pop in for a quick drink however i would feel welcome here no matter what attire i m wearing despite it s chandeliers and other extravagant items it s tucked away in a nice little corner which mean there not many people just wandering in off the street and yet there still a nice mix of people inside the atmosphere is relaxed and there is usually some sort of entertainment on
  this is not only the best burger in pittsburgh it s also the best burger in the usa cooked to perfection the home fires are off the hook too there is other stuff on the menu but stick with the burgers great eats when in pittsburgh i will make time for a stop at tessaro s
  not what i would expect to see decor wise for an ayce sushi place but don t let that deter you they serve some of the freshest fish the wait staff is nothing but super friendly either definitely a go to spot if you love sushi
  mark s cafe is tempe s hidden breakfast gem the service is top notch being extremely friendly and making you feel right at home shoutout to amber and her talent as the taste whisperer where she will as what you like and recommend something that you may have never thought you d try the food here is extremely filling delicious and well priced with many of the dishes having large portions to ensure maximum deliciousness i had the country waffle which is a large waffle topped with white gravy bacon ham and fried chicken and was immediately launched into tastebud heaven the gravy really sealed the deal and i recommend getting some dish with it or getting some on the side i will definitely be coming back the next time i m around town
  great wings and pizza try the double ipa to wash it down refreshing also friendly and efficient service upscale sports bar kind of feel
  it s a tale of very good good and ugly for me so wanted to love it but alas only a three very good as many on yelp have suggested was the korean bowl with pork just enough spice to satisfy without overwhelming thoroughly enjoyed 5 for this one very good was the selection of cheese and the two that we selected perfect and delicious good was the deviled eggs had a nice siracci mayo we both enjoyed this now unfortunately the bad heard great things about the burgers ordered one and it was raw now the waitress never asked how we wanted it but raw standard is medium picky folks like my wife is medium well but ground meat is chock full of bacteria when you grind meat the outsides and insides mix so simply searing the newly formed outside doesn t kill the former outside that s now in epic fail for high end place asked waitress to cook more and all she said was how do you want it cooked and not so sorry to serve you raw ground beef kinda bummed me out wanted to give a four star but if i get ill tonight may downgrade to two
  this is our goto place for celebrations and a great meal always fresh always good service drinks appetizers dinner dessert entirely yumm o
  are you a beer lover and i don t mean bud light i mean do you truly enjoy trying new and exciting beers if you do then this tap system will blow your mind like it did mine i am an ipa lover and always get a new ipa when i am here if the alcohol content in your beer isn t too high you can get a half yard beer oh yes this is the beer tap system that excites us who truly love beer the food being delicious is just a bonus
  this is a solid restaurant i especially loved the decor and friendly staff ultimately it comes down to the food and the food to me was meh it was okay but nothing great i had the avocado skillet besides the tomatillo which was great the rest of the dish was very average i wish my potatoes had more flavor my sister had the chicken and waffles neither were very good even with the gravy both lacked the flavor or kick i was looking for
  very interesting i came here on a friday night post dinner to grab some drinks with my fellow amateur beer connoisseurs therefore did not try much on the menu though i did notice many dishes i would come back to try but when i do return it will not be for the beer while i would like to think that i am a beer drinker who is open to trying a variety of brews i left here wishing i hadn t my husband and i dove right in and got the flight since we were not familiar with any of their beers but even while looking at the list noticed they all seemed to blur together in regard to flavors descriptions and ibus i m not sure if this is a common occurrence or just something we happened to experience while visiting here but their lack of variety really turned me off while finishing the beer our group got hungry and decided to try their spicy hummus which was the highlight of our visit very tasty and perfectly spicy plus i loved that they include a mix of pita and cucumber and top it off with sriracha can t go wrong there my tip for prospective visitors go here if you like a hipster ambiance hoppy beer and above par bar food my tip for wilderness offer a more well rounded selection of brews and create a more concise and visual description of your beers
  this is my first time here and i ordered the veggie mu shu wrap and it is amazing i will defiantly be back
  it satisfies the craving but delivery is slow if you want spicy you gotta ask for extra super spicy or you will hardly taste it i got crab rangoon and they had only mayo in them i called to inquire and i asked if there wasn t supposed to be crab in them she laughed and said no guess thats just how they make them but every other place i ve had them at has crab and cheese i may still order when i m too lazy to leave the house and craving chines but definitely not my first choice
  i am giving this 2 1 2 stars as it has goods and bads lets start with the positives nice scenery as we were seated next to the flamingo exhibit food was good not great but good large choice of foods and desserts were yummy lets finish with the not so good our waitress was horrible had to ask 5 times for water and still never got it had to ask three times for coffee before getting that its a bit expensive for what it has to offer and the service 20 00 for a brunch buffet that does not include the champagne just doesn t cut it don t think i would try here again
  we stooped for our first time for an early dinner the menu was huge and filled with a variety of items that caught our attention for the good and for the bad ie everything with intestine we were less than daring and ordered three items we tried to order pan fried dumplings but the waiter redirected us to the pot stickers good advice they were perfect we then asked for entree recommendations the first was a beautiful looking and quite tasty beef ginger and scallion plate the second dish of chicken and basil was quite tasty but the chicken pieces were splintered with bones and difficult if not dangerous to eat overall the taste and quality of it all was very good and we will go back we will not order anything from the chicken portion of the menu
  amazing food was great the chef came out and greeted us everything was delicious i would definitely visit again
  after all the great things said about this place i decided to give it a try the carne asada was delicious and their guacamole was fresh
  have to write a quick update because this week i visited fez twice with my in laws since they are in town after picking them up from the airport i took them to fez for brunch this was my first time trying the brunch and i can say for certain that i will be back loved my breakfast panini and it was just the right amount of food my in laws loved the frittata and eggs benedict after being wowed by brunch my in laws insisted on going back for dinner the 5 martinis on tuesday night were awesome my mother in law is determined to figure out the apricot martini so she can make them at home as always the fez burger the rosemary chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries were delish according to my inlaws the lamb kisra was great and heated up well the next day for lunch fez is still the go to place for good food good atmosphere and good people
  overall pretty mediocre i enjoyed the breakfast and it s a cheap alternative and a great way to fill up for a long day of sight seeing or gambling however the lunch and dinner left me wanting more
  the food is so so with poor service this place is dirty the wonton soup we ordered taste like soup from the can i had terrible diarrhea when i got home we don t recommend this place unless you are willing to take the risk of having possible e coli infection our family and friends were disappointed this is one of the place in our blacklist
  we dined here for dinner during our june 2010 vacation in montreal and had and wonderful experince we happened upon this restaurant which was located close to our hotel the food was excellent and the service was kind and attentive the stars of this menu were the fresh homemade pasta dishes i had the best pasta dish i ve ever enjoyed which was their fresh fettucini with smoked salmon it was divine i could ve probably inhaled 3 more plates of this just thinking back on it now i seriuosly had seperation anxiety for the next few days thinking back to this dish my mom had the mushroom risotto which she loved they made a little alfredo penne pasta dish for my daughter and my wife enjoyed their chicken parmigana dish with spaghetti i think she s the only one who ever orders this they also provide fresh warm baked bread with olive oil that my wife daughter and mother devoured i felt he prices were very reasonable and the portions were generous overall we had a great experiance here and i would definitely return again if only to re order that fettucini with smoked salmon
  i have gone here for the last few years the service sucks and the food just gets worse and worse it has gone downhill from here this place used to be our normal hangout with friends but i have not come back in six months
  heading back to bar soba again loving this pub just now drinks are very reasonably priced looking forward to sampling the food for the first time
  tired of the same old ahwatukee restaurants we decided to give joe s farm grill in gilbert a try we actually couldn t decide on joe s farm grill or joe s real bbq but ultimately picked farm grill because i was craving fries and the bbq joint does not serve them when we arrived there was a line to order however it moved pretty quickly i ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and although initially i wanted fries i opted for the onion rings at the last minute both were excellent i rarely order a chicken sandwich because usually a grilled chicken sandwich from a restaurant is inedible but here the chicken was moist and flavorful i was not disappointed the onion rings were great too my man ordered the double dogs with chili two chili dogs they looked really good he also had fries that i shared we sat outside since we were lucky enough to have 80 ish degrees in the middle of a phoenix summer it was so nice the sounds and the smells of the farm reminded me of bbqs and picnics i enjoyed as a child in illinois and made me realize it was probably time for a visit again next time we are going to give joe s real bbq a try
  wow this place may soon become a regular stop i also am hoping that it will become worthy of a 5 star rating the wife and i wanted chinese food and diana and sangeetha s reviews sold us on llv and we were not disappointed the location is a bit iffy but the place was clean we were the only eat in customers but that didn t dissuade us as others mentioned the service was very good and the menu must have changed from the older reviews as the owner let us know that the only meat served is seafood and all other meat is faux also she said that all of their sauces are animal free i had kung pao tofu and the wife had garlic veggies we both had brown rice and veggie wontons the veggie wontons were hands down the best fried wontons i have ever had no cream cheese here just veggies and an amazing sauce they were lightly fried and not oily my main dish was great plenty of flavor and good spice could have been a hair spicier veggies were not overcooked at all the tofu was good i prefer fried but this wasn t which was fine because it is probably healthier the wife greatly enjoyed her dish also a bit spicy the serving sizes were huge and we both have lunch for tomorrow the main dishes non seafood are around the 8 9 range and the wontons were 6ish we will definitely be back
  yum yum you want a great filet come here you want a great filet with awesome service come here i crave this place i wish i had some warning though the first time i came here that filets were al a carte despite this i enjoyed myself immensely all the times i have come here and in reality they do not make you ponder what else you could of spent your money on i hate that feeling go here you will be happy
  i know there are a billion other reviews on this place but since i frequent it a lot i figured i would put my two sense in love short rib fried rice thai style chicken wings amazing and the yellow curry i also love the ambiance and vibe of the outside seating hate not nearly enough seats and can sometimes lead to crazy wait times if your into thai food i think this is definitely a place to check out especially after a night of hanging out in dtlv
  after devouring a delicious wrap from this place they had no spicy chicken left so i just asked the guy to make any delicious wrap all the ingredients are so fresh and the base sauce is lovely in tangy if your looking for some lunch this place is a perfect place for a great wrap
  why the low ratings food was great i had the thai basil w chicken and requested it spicy it was no crowds on saturday for lunch
  nice quiet little place to have breakfast or brunch i wasn t too impressed with the egg halendaise the price is a bit pricey for what the portions all
  this place is my favorite place when i get off of work kitchen is still open with there reverse happy hour beers on tap for 3 50 and couple appetizer for 3 99 server always recognise us and remember what we usually order prices are really affordable and the food really good always bring new friends so they can discover our favourite late stop and dogs frendly patio
  the food here is amazing the service is great the staff of the family owned restaurant knows everyone by name they have a lot of different choices and the the food is a good mix of chinese vietnamese and thai influence they don t over americanize their dishes my personal favorites are the won ton noodle soup the black pepper chicken and the green curry
  gyro fully stuffed and sauce were great couldn t even finish it
  great mexican food and generally a short wait we have come here multiple times since this location opened we have enjoyed the food and like to sit on the balcony when the weather isn t too bad the wait staff is young but attentive we will continue to come here frequently
  tried this place out of desperation and not wanting to stop at one of the many fast food places nearby maybe i would have been better off at one of them the service was ok waitress was friendly very dark lighting and the food was below average maybe it s just me but it seems that the food in all these restaurant chains has taken a turn for the worse we ordered off the 2 for 20 section and got the wings as an appetizer which were not wings at all more like chunks of chicken got an order of the chicken strips with fries for the kids again not very chicken like and an order of the 3 cheese penne with chicken well by now i think you can guess that the chicken sucked here none of the food was hot just sort of warm the food all tasted pretty crappy and very processed i guess that s what i get for going to a chain like this never again
  found this place here in yelp and i love it i was a little worried about getting grocery store sushi the first time i walked in but that is not the case here the service is always prompt and the food has yet to let me down needless to say my girl and i are now regulars
  i have now been here for dinner twice and can fully commit to the 5 star rating in december a friend brought my sister and i here for our xmas present leeann d s review summs up that experience perfectly except she left out the bread basket i swear i could have been happy just sitting there eating bread all night it was such a great selection the last time i was here was for restaurant week as a thank you for the meal in dec the manager gave my friend a 50 gift card for a return visit that had to be used by beginning of feb so we decided to eat here again mixed green salad was good dressing on the side though otherwise it drowns the lettuce porcini rubbed tournedos of beef were excellent and i actually couldn t finish both the mashed potatos were probably the best i have ever had anywhere you just knew there was 3 sticks of butter and a ton of heavy cream in there but they were simply amazing the creamed spinach however tasted like soap bleh our server replaced them when we told her they tasted funny but the 2nd batch just had a milder soapy flavor still this was not enough to ruin an otherwise perfect meal creme brulee to finish up and the chocolate espresso cake to go since my friend doesn t care for dessert was a great ending to the meal with the gift card and the restaurant week pricing it made this meal with 4 glasses of wine and 2 cocktail about 43 pre tip tip on the pre discounted amount and we still walked away paying 60 for a meal that could have been a lot more expensive i almost felt like we were stealing since i know how pricey this place can be
  great low key spot in the foothills awesome happy hour specials and the staff is very friendly
  i was here earlier in the week to meet somebody for a business lunch i ordered an everything bagel with tomato and cream cheese and a bowl of chicken noodle soup the soup was fine but the toasted bagel came undressed with my 2 slices of tomato in a little cup and little sealed pre packed thing of cream cheese this seemed odd since they make sandwiches they can t dress your bagel also the cream cheese had an odd taste to it sort of blue cheese esque i double checked to make sure they had given me plain cream cheese yup plain cream cheese the bagel was pretty bland a bit disappointing for an everything bagel it is what it is the service was polite and fast
  after 10 15 minutes of waiting for the server she started off by telling us that they were short on staff even though there were 10 12 tables and 4 servers as for the food the presentation was good unfortunately it goes downhill from there due to the stale potatoes and bland chorizo and eggs the food and service in its restaurant doesn t match the hotel
  i am a fan from the downtown location and now that this north phoenix location is open i m a fan of this one too the same great lunch special is offered the food is prepared very quickly and they deliver great curry great tom yum soup great drunken noodles great house fried rice and great thai teas the people are nice and do their best to try and get to know the customer in their new area give them a try and u won t be disappointed
  i got the dinner special with a spring roll sweet and sour soup chicken balls and noodles the service was great he was friendly and helpful recommending and suggesting which i appreciated the meal came to just over 11 everything was pretty good but the chicken balls and the spring roll were my highlights i wouldn t order the sweet and sour soup again i m not a soup person but wanted to try it and i would order rice instead of the noodles food came out in under 5 minutes from walk in order i would go there again
  get to terrace cafe stat if you are a professional brunch er life myself the brunch was delicious i ve actually been to terrace cafe twice the first time i got the signature red velvet waffle and chicken it was mediocre at best nothing special about the waffle and the breading of the chicken came off as soon as you cut it i hate that so fast forward to six mos later and my brunch crew decided to go to terrace i was like cool i hear folks rave about it lemme give it a 2nd shot the french toasts are awesome we all got different kinds mine was by far the best it was the seasonal pumpkin the lemon poppy seed was good but a little dry they have removed the banana nut french toast from the menu we inquired about it and were told it was gone followed by our server saying everyone asks about it so why would they remove something so popular so why is this place not 5 stars well i can t forget the mediocre first experience i also hate no reservations and the fact that they won t seat you until your whole party is there i have a perpetually late girlfriend 4 of us arrived and waited and waited and waited they would not seat us until the 5th got there that is an annoyance i can understand why but they d rather leave those booths empty then seat us here s why i say that when girlfriend finally arrived we were seated upstairs in the only tables booths actually that could accommodate more then 4 people well all of the booths were empty so my question is why hold them and make us wait in the coffee bar did they think we were lying about having the 5th person it just didn t make sense and was irritating they also got one of the orders wrong service seemed frazzled we never had the same server twice actually
  i love tacos plain and simple and that is how i like my tacos too plain and simple your taco meat or vegetables for you non animal eating people with onions and cilantro el pastor gives it to you just like that the tacos i ate yesterday were a 4 5 that is the truth i was hungry and i wanted tacos they themselves were brilliant however if i am going to rate the entire overall experience i am giving my experience from yesterday a 3 5 maybe it was because i was crabby from being up until 4 am but i felt like i was waiting for an eternity for my food to arrive when i arrived to el pastor we were seated but it took a while for our waitress to come greet us and i actually believe it was the host that eventually came back to take our drink order and not even our waitress for 2 pm on a sunday afternoon there were people in there but not enough people in there for me to have to wait as long as i did i do believe my linner lunner lunch and dinner was the same as the man friends i think we both had the pork chicken and chorizo tacos bless those tacos i would bill the chicken tacos as my least favorite of the three yesterday with the chorizo being the stand out star it was spiced beautifully and served at a perfect temperature it was slightly more charred than what i would have liked but hey it was still pretty darn good will i be back duh but will it be anytime soon probably not as i am hearing of this new taco hot spot on the east side that i believe needs to be checked out soon
  good food great service awesome atmosphere i had the grilled chicken spinach wrap with ranch bbq sauce home made coleslaw and a garlic pickle spear all very fresh and delicious will visit again on my next trip back to vegas
  you know a place is poppin when you have to wait 2 hours to get in but all good cuz the homie hooked it up with that vip status aka he gamble a lot so we got in real quick i m talking quickbooks son i heard cesar himself ate at this place my mexican homie and even he said me encanta when in rome do as the romans do and man do the romans know how to eat son let me break it down for you guys to make this review easier to read architecture design ain t nobody trying to eat at a basic ass sit down buffet this place is architecturally sound glass everywhere those good old architecturally sound roman arches go learn something and google it are made of glass but it s sparkling glass the type that glistens when lights hit it kinda like vampires from twilight not that i watch twilight just saying lay out is pretty awesome too all foods are separated by segregation that s right racism is even alive in food asian food towards the rear of the buffet crackers and deli in the middle bbq in the front damn right bbq deserves to be in the front even vegans know food let s get to it aweeeesommmee brisket and the ribs are good enough to bring peace on mother earth they got lamb chicken turkey pork beef combine em all and you get la chupa fawking cabra who else you know got la chupa cabra even the people serving the food are happy that s the key you want people creating your food to be happy as pharrell that way you taste the love not in a weird way though you know what i mean seafood is everywhere you want your crab legs you get your damn crab legs and some they have ramen soup though i m not a big fan or ramen soup other people are crackers deli meat and cheese dooo not sleep on this i m talking these are 5 star caliber lunchables people another thing to not sleep on are the horchata guava and strawberry drinks they keep in a glass if you ever have a bad day one drink of either of those and you taste the meaning of life enjoyment baby did i mention there are unlimited mimosas mama say mama say mi ma mosa ode to mj i know ya ll vegas peeps love you some mimosas i see ya ll on instagram hashtagging the shit out of it mimosa dessert where do you start gelato ice cream so much cake it s ridiculous the downside of the awesome buffet is you probably won t have enough space for dessert of course they also have fruit but if you re like me you go straight for the meat anyway if you have the moola and time to spare or you have a homie in the vip brazzers then try this place out you won t regret it
  excellent all around service cleanliness and food i ve been there a handful of times and always great so happy we have them on this side of town
  they close at 8 00 pm on weeknights i pull in at 7 50 wondering will they be open if so will the food be leftovers heck open there was a line at the counter took me 5 minutes to get to the front of the line this was a good thing bobbee s is not only open but thriving a great thing as usual bobbee was there with a friendly greeting service was good and friendly and of course the bbq was excellent i had the brisket dinner and as usual it was delish in every way and as always thanks bobbee
  delizioso this place has got the closest thing to real italian pizza that i ve found in vegas the roman style is just that crispy and perfect flavor their ingredients are quality which make the price a bit higher than your normal pizza place but this is not a normal pizza place the service is spot on the most adorable italian female server forget her name she is perfection ensuring your experience is pleasant with her italian hospitality oh and did i mention the wine get selection can t go wrong with this place
  stumbled across this place when my hubby was out of town and i wasn t feeling well great pricing close to home and they deliver the egg rolls are huge you get twice as many crab rangoon as other places and the fried rice seems homemade just made fresh the first time i ordered delivery they said 45 min totally fine it was a busy night they showed up in 15 the second time we thought they were closing soon and felt bad ordering for delivery the gentleman said it wasn t a problem they expanded their hours as they are continuing to get busier and busier this is def our new spot
  love this place its so unique from any other hot dog place that looking at the menu i couldnt decide what to get because they all look good father got a angry dog i got a chicago because my sensitive stomach but still was amazing got the euro fries as well
  best pizza period its a hidden gem if you are not looking for it you will walk past it if ever at the cosmopolitan make sure you ask about the pizza place restaurant has no name but everyone knows what you are talking about the crust makes that pizza amazing ask for the deluxe slice the white slice and a sicilian the guys working there are all great guys chef jay is the best we will definitely be back whenever in vegas even if its for a couple slices
  food 4 eastern s taco y taco is the exact opposite of tropicana staco y taco and not in a very good way although they serve the exact same food and the same price eastern s serving portion sizes are substantially less than tropicana s the staff here are less friendlier too snotty is a more appropriate characterization customer service sucks worse than an inoperable vacuum cleaner i ve been here twice and my second visit was worse than the first time although eastern is way closer to me than tropicana s i d rather drive to tropicana s to really enjoy all that is best from taco y taco suffice to say the 2 star is for the staff and the customer service this taco y taco spot took over what was once republiq that took over another establishment whose name i don t remember all the previous occupants were short termers and didnt last and eastern taco y taco is deemed doomed to follow the same fate
  unless this place has changed recently i can not see anyone giving it five stars i try this place every couple of years thinking that it will get better the food looks fine and there is plenty of it the problem is that i get sick almost every time i eat it nothing serious just an upset stomach or the like i have heard others mention the same reaction i keep hoping that they will fix what ever it is because it is cheap and plentiful
  great buffet for the price and value unlimited mimosas for sat and sun brunch 8 am 3 pm good selection of food the desserts were alright i liked the prime rib eggs benedict mashed potatoes
  came here for breakfast a few times every time has been just ok nothing great overpriced that s for sure easily 20 without beverage for some eggs and bacon sausage with toast i don t mind spending on good food but eggs and toast is just eggs and toast anyway you make it i wouldn t recommend unless you just want the convenience of grabbing some pretty basic breakfasts right downstairs by the elevator
  my boyfriend i were here tonight stephanie was fantastic the food incredible we will now be regulars thank you
  i enjoy it here every single time i come service is always friendly and quick usually when you order orange juice it comes in a tiny cup here you get a nice large glass of it and the pancakes are a must every single time their syrup is always served warm and it s the best syrup you can find
  hard rock is just okay i have actually been to many many hard rocks but not always to eat usually we are only going to get a guitar pin from the different cities we visit because we know the food isn t that good the food is never bad it s just never that good almost ever single time we go here which i swear is too often i order the twisted mac and cheese i get this for two reasons one i love mac and cheese and two i love cavatappi pasta hr s version of the classic cheesy pasta is a mildly spiced cheese sauce that lightly coats the curly pasta don t expect to have a thick and creamy mac and cheese here you won t be getting that the pasta is then topped with the expected dry piece of blackened chicken why expected it s expected because i have literally been to hr s all over the country on both coasts and every single one serves dry chicken i guess that s what they teach at the hr school of cooking i guess they just put more focus on music than food who knows why i gave hr three stars i will never know why i keep going back is certainly beyond my capacity to understand maybe they put crack in the mac that would explain why i order it time and time again if you haven t been i suggest going just once it s fun to compare all the different hr s
  this is the best place i am from detroit so it s great to have a place that i can go to when i need some comfort food from the motor city love the coney dog and faygo i have sent most of my friends by to get a coney
  be sure to make reservations otherwise you ll be sadly disappointed that they re book solid i ve been to montreal twice and both times made sure i booked in advance during the warmer seasons they open the restaurant windows so try to snag a seat there as it s the best seat in the house or venture further back into the restaurant for a more intimate setting this is hands down the best portuguese food i ve ever had their cod and risotto is to die for
  we went to rhythm kitchen for their cajun thanksgiving dinner we are from louisiana terribly disappointed school cafeteria food better than what they served totally misrepresented the quality of the food and to top it off they served the mediocre pecan pie on styrofoam plate
  i went with lamb and mint i can t really explain or relate it to anything per say but it was gooooood the dipping sauce gravy it came with was really good at first glance it didn t look like it d fill me up but i was surprised the meat and stuff is packed pretty dense so it works the bread is really tasty and crusty but not too dry the beers were like 6 a pop and for two of us it was 30 before tip i ll go back was pretty good lots of other pasties to try on the menu
  this rosaties is super slow they suck as i am typing this i am still waiting on my pizza i don t like this i am hungry this is ridiculous
  word on the street is that the pink pony is sporting a new saddle and by that it s been remodeled revamped embarrassingly enough i have to admit that i have never been to this establishment in all my time living in scottsdale the pink pony is an iconic restaurant and a huge part of scottsdale history so it was worth a little visit i went after a two day long staff retreat and as you can guess my rubber arm wasn t hard to twist as we were all in need of a drink or two maybe three who s counting it s the beginning of july here in phoenix and no one in their right mind sits outside in the late afternoon this time of year so we bypassed the cool looking patio arizona room esqe entry and headed indoors inside we were greeted with a monochrome sleek and modern decor with lots of booths and highboys to gather around the place was pretty quiet but picked up after a bit the demographic tad on the older side but whatevs ordered a drink called the forbidden fruit at the recommendation of the bartender now i know what its deemed forbidden no one should ever taste what i did unless you re a fan of taking an entire pack of sweet tarts shoving it in your mouth and chewing them up do not try this drink i decided to be boring but safe and order some sav blanc and it was the most mind blowing glass of wine i d had all day we went to town on apps pretzels and beer cheese hummus sliders they were to die for blue cheese fritters and chili cheese fries a perfect combination of gut rot and awesomeness not a bad little place to head for a quick bite and some drinks i d go back
  i wanted to love it because i love the name but the pizza was just very bland i got the personal cheese and it was fine i would come back if a bunch of people wanted to go but would not seek it out for myself good service but the pizza is pretty average
  pro food was stellar dessert was beautiful and tasty romantic feeling worth every penny con customer service waited 15 minutes for someone to ask me what i wanted to drink heard hostesses talking trash about every guest that walked in
  serviceable asian like food dan dan noodles were good but enough for two or one really hungry person very loud restaurant the more people the louder it got they play music in the restaurant but you can t hear it over the ambient noise it just adds to the din
  we went here today for lunch everything was absolutely delicious i started off with a butternut squash soup that was probably the best soup i have ever tasted really a 10 inch spicy basil shrimp pizza followed and was awesome
  pizza here is top notch owner is pretty funny and the chicken francese is off the charts for some reason i thought ordering grilled eggplant was a good idea obviously it wasnt but at least i wasnt too full definitely reccomended and i might even feel comfy enough to eat solo at the bar here in the future
  the food is pretty good but i felt that the service was a little too rushed i felt that they tried to clear my plates a little too quickly even when i was still eating from it we tried some tasty rolls and loved with their garlic chicken i d be back for that alone
  let me preface this by saying i am pretty much a yelp lurker i only created an account because my friends keep sending me invites i didn t care much about writing reviews but now thats gonna change with that said texas de brazil will be my first written review yay how exciting last week was my roommates 30th birthday to celebrate in style we decided to spend a week in vegas my friend heard about texas de brazil from all the good yelp reviews i m skeptical as most yelp reviews i ve read over hype most places i was however quite excited to try out a all you can eat brazillian bbq for the first time we only waited less than 5 minutes to be seated and headed our way to the salad bar choice selection was plentiful and quality was great i had the potatoes au gratin roasted mushrooms and the lobster bisque and all were excellent we were now ready for the good stuff the rotisserie roasted meats that make this place famous servers acting as south american cowboys or gauchos come to your table with a choice of meat and cut them for you there was a total of 10 selections and we got to try all of them i would hands down say the flank steak was the best it was so delectable so juicy and succulent you can almost drown in it the lamb gets honorable mentions cooked perfectly and very delicious the top sirloin was also good the fat just melts in your mouth their filet mignon was meh i had the bacon wrapped one and it was a bit over cooked and chewy the service here is amazing our waiter catered to us at every moment and was very friendly the gauchos timing was impeccable you never had a plate full of meat by the time you were finished with something there goes a gaucho offering another selection which is important because no one likes cold meat or missing a selection and waiting longer for it to make its round again i would say the only let down for me was the sangria we ordered a pitcher of red sangria and it was nothing out of the ordinary plain flavors and extremely watered down from all that ice they put in there lame overall my experience at tdb was wonderful i can definitely look forward to this place next time we go to vegas again what made it even better was that my friend had a coupon for 50 off of our meal now thats awesomely awesome
  worst restaurant ever i left my debit card at the restaurant after my payment i stayed in the restaurant for awhile they should have plenty of to tell me that i forgot to pick up my card however they didnt inform me of anything untill i made two calls after i left i called them twice about my lost card they finally admitted that they have my debit card this is hella of disappointing i cant believe they are so dishonest i will never recommend it to anyone
  im soo surprised with the food that we ate im from california and was excited to experience this restaurant especially since it is a local fav i ordered the house made spaghetti expecting a fresh tomato base sauce unfortunately what i got tasted like a canned sauce with minced onions it had no flavor now maybe i ruined the meal by ordering gluten free noodles but i didnt think that would make it this bad im soo sorry because our server was awesome and they even accommodated our big party on a good note the bread was delicious as much as i hate olive garden i would preferred that
  i took my girlfriend there for a valentine s day dinner it was great a very nice menu with wine included at a reasonable price the ceviche was wonderful and the ny steaks were cooked perfectly i will return and bring friends next time
  meh have had much better pies are small single serving and not inexpensive nice crowd and some decent music but atmosphere won t fill your wine glass mine was the smallest serving of a house wine that i ve seen in years these folks are cheap our waiter was slow and when he brought the bill he brought a comment card for us to fill out that was already filled in this restaurant is trying so hard to be cool to have real italian pizzas and they re not making it to the owners i would say it s worth the drive one weekend to visit cottonwood arizona where they can stop at pizzeria bocce that s a true one of a kind gourmet pizza restaurant with the same style of cool they are going for here at the pizza people pub
  love this place delicious cookies and great service love it love it love it my favorite is pistachio and coconut yammmmmm
  i love benihana i had not been in almost 10 yrs and it still was as exciting nothing like being seated with a bunch randoms
  if you re a lover of katsu or teriyaki chicken beef this is a great fast food restaurant the food is cooked after you place your order the grill right behind the counter so you can see you food being cooked immediately portion size is fairly large and they have a nice selection of lunch combos i love that they have the sauces on the condiment bar so you don t have to ask for more sauce parking can be difficult since it s part of the tempe marketplace but not a huge deal
  absolutely amazing food and service sit at the bar enjoy a berry white martini and spicy edamame this is a staple place for me and friends never had a bad roll worth the price dam jumper is my all time favorite
  customer service here is phenomenal food is always excellent unless i overstuff myself
  really good food i love that i can choose between healthy or fattening i ve actually only ordered from the healthy side so far because everything looks so good regardless and the few times i ve been here i really liked the food ahi fish tacos are superb and the acai bowl is bangin looking forward to coming back in the future
  i love this place we always come for lunch and it s always packed i enjoy the fish burrtio but i m not the biggest fan of fish but i like it here bc it has pineapples and other things so i don t get the fish taste i also like the self serve salsas the service is always fast and i love to sit outside on a nice hot day to enjoy my phat burrito
  i thought it was tasty you ll have to add toppings a la carte style good service check out my ramen pic enjoy
  these xiao long bao are better and cheaper than the ones you can find in to the fried beef curry dumplings are also really good my husband can t get enough of the soy cucumber noodle side dish only 2 99
  nice spot for brunch after a long night celebrating halloween i got the smoked salmon omelette the eggs were kind of weird but it was delicious nonetheless we had a part of 7 people and they put at us at table that i can only imagine was intended for 4 the place was packed and we were starving so i m just glad we got to sit and eat
  happy hour specials the shrimp quacomole dish on the happy hour menu is yum i i also had the ahi tuna app which had this great sauce not sure what else was in it the waiter was super funny and a the patio with the sun shining perfect
  if i had rated on the first visit i would have probably gave it 4 stars but i went twice on a week day evening it s quieter and they have live music the food was great the service awesome but on a sunday night things where less perfect the food was o k but my new york 14 oz pittsburgh cook medium rare was dryish inside i think it s more for the piece of meat itself that the cooking that was done perfectly but overall it was the proximity of the tables and loud customers that ruined it feel the place is more appropriate for groups than couples
  this place is amazing good taste great and the salsa is rich in flavor anyone looking for a good mexican food place to eat come here
  george s chocolate banana shake stop omg
  delicious thin crust vpn certified pizzas we returned to california and longed for the vpn pizzas we found a restaurant in marina del rey that was vpn certified and it sucked can t wait for settebello to open their location in pasadena this fall
  i was craving a burger fries but i didn t want just any burger with all the crazy things i read about the beef nowadays on top of that i gave up red meat for lent so what do i do to satisfy my craving i yelped vegan elevation burger came up when i walked in my children i were greeted by this friendly young fellow he told us about their their organic grass fed beef organic veggie burgers potato buns how their fries were cooked with olive oil sold i m all about the healthier lifestyle even though it s a bit pricer i opt for the organic or natural stuff as you probably already know you can really taste the difference plus it s better for you i m very cautious on what my kids eat all these gmo s additives crap that s put in food these days it s scary watch the movie the beautiful truth you ll know what i m talking about the cashier who took my order was a cute sweet young lady she was telling me how this restaurant just opened recently how good the shakes are they use real fruit some organic products they have organic milk if i didn t have dessert earlier i would of ordered one but i will definitely order 1 next time that organic cheesecake shake caught my eye so i ordered my son a organic grass fed beef burger my other son a grilled cheese i had the organic veggie burger 2 when you order they have a list of toppings so you can just tell the cashier what you want on it cheese is extra which i didn t mind because they use real cheddar cheese we also got 1 order of fries which was enough for me my 2 kids omg my veggie burger was so good fresh cooked just right the fries were skinny crispy on the outside soft on the inside very addicting not that salty like some places where they get real heavy handed w the seasoning if you do like it saltier you could always add more not a big deal both my sons enjoyed finished their meal my kids are real picky eaters too i can t wait to come back try the shakes i don t think they have organic condiments so i think i m going to be a little ghetto bring in my own organic condiments next time shhh how exciting that this place opened up for people like me my family looking for healthier alternatives when we go out to eat all this organic eating can be quite orgasmic yay for healthy good eats
  by vegas standards this place is pretty good surprisingly kinda decent vibe inside don t be fooled by it being in a strip mall p s the tea place downstairs is worth a try as well
  one of the best pizzas i have ever tasted i selected the build your own pizza which allows you to completely customize your own pie imagine your order experience at a subway that is basically what you can expect at project pie they have a very good variety of cheese meats and toppings such as ricotta mozzarella goat cheese meat balls canadian bacon prosciutto fresh garlic artichokes mushrooms spinach pineapple etc the ingredients are of very good quality which made the pizza have an incredible flavor the staff was friendly ambiance felt very lively and nice and the price for the pie was highly affordable 12 for the fully customized pie i will definitely be returning next time i am in vegas
  during the weeks prior to our visit to pizzeria bianco we d heard nothing but great things alas the reality did not match the expectations our 18 pizza was no different to the five that we had tried at the pizza festival the weekend before while the atmosphere was pleasant and homey we concluded that the new york times must have been drunk when they rated pizzeria bianco as the best pizza in america we ordered dominos mere hours later therefore my rating is a three star a ok impress your date but not your taste buds
  i never was really bold enough to try gyros until i landed in chambana and was told zorbas was worth a go i do like their classic gyro and the price is good and it always goes well with the crinkle fries the location is great for students on campus but often you need to work around the busy lunch hour or wait until summer when all the undergrads are gone watching the sports on television or listening to jazz on thursday is also a draw in case you decide to come alone for lunch dinner
  nothing special here came here for breakfast and menu options are basically limited to your standard items you would find at an ihop compared to the other food options available in the area il fornaio can be pricey for breakfast considering you are only like 5 away from getting the same food at a buffet i guess the only good thing is that if you sit outside the restaurant you can overlook the casino floor while you eat it would be hard to justify eating here unless you getting a dining credit from ny ny even that i don t know so many choices for good food out there
  after reading mostly good reviews my gf and decided we d give it a shot we ordered the kung pow beef hot and sour soup shrimp fried rice crab wantons and orange chicken the beef was good the hot and sour soup wasn t even edible shrimp fried rice was decent at best crab wontons were pretty good the orange chicken was dry and pretty nasty i wouldn t recommend this place i will say however that the delivery was timely and the delivery guy was cheerful
  came here while in edinburgh because of the high reviews on yelp we came early and was asked to wait while they were still cleaning the floors we sat for about 10 min and was seated i was really looking forward to a great indian meal but what we got was really bland food since this was the second indian restaurant we had while in uk that was bland and flavorless we figured this is just how it is served on the other side of the pond it seemed like the food needed some more flavoring or cooked longer to bring out the taste was very disappointing although the restaurant was very clean and the bathroom was very nice
  this place has been here for years and always enjoy their food for some reason i only go once a year but the food never changes to me this is chinese food when you pull up it looks small but when you walk inside you realize how far back it goes i ordered the 13 spicy orange chicken its a large portion served with a heaping mound of white rice it could be brown rice but i think its white with soy sauce a decent sized egg roll and 2 of those chip things stuck on top if your eating in you get a small bowl of egg drop soup this is the only thing i have issue with its bland its always beautiful and the texture creamy but no spices are used but just add a dash of salt and pepper and its delicious this place isn t packed but quite a few tables taken whenever i go in its good for small or large groups they have these round tables and a turn thing lazy suzanne in the middle so you can turn it to the dish you want the service is pretty good and the restaurant is always nice and clean
  love love love culvers not 5 stars bec they forgot four items and had to go back for 2 of them the other night they were friendly and they apologized the food was fresh as always
  i haven t eaten too many banh mi sandwiches but this was the best by far i ordered the shaken beef very fresh tasting ingredients and outstanding bread the restaurant was very clean and modern the service was very friendly i will definitely be back to try more
  best ramen in arizona hands down
  grabbed a quick bite before a play at gammage found it thru yelp and my two friends expressed they hoped it would be good it was better than good walking up it was had such a cool vibe one woman said it reminded her of seattle another said california and i thought it could have been new york too what s for sure it did not seem to be in phoenix and that it is a compliment it was 6pm on a wed and we were the only patrons there no one else came the whole time until we left at 7 they don t know what they re missing we started with the organic hummus omg the best i have ever had waaay better than that p jungle place which i like i do one woman ordered the spinach garbanzo which is an appetizer but plenty hardy enough as a meal it was scrumptious the best of our three items i think i will order that next time for sure i ordered the protein bowl with chicken very tasty the rice was so good i almost ate all of it and i m so picky on rice i hardly ever eat much score my other friend loved the hummus so much that is what she ordered for dinner btw the naan they serve with it is so soft and melt in your mouth wonderful it was the best i have ever had i am so sorry that gal who wrote that 1 star review wasn t able to eat here on her birthday she would have loved it come back give them another chance you won t regret it the only reason it didn t get 5 stars was because even though we were the only patrons and even though the waiter was very sweet and nice he disappeared and we always had to hunt him or yell out for items more wine etc btw that red argentina wine was sooooo good felt that shouldn t happen when the place was deserted of clients he s young he ll learn i hope and people come here support the delicious healthy places that dare to step outside the boring phoenix box re food sorry no pic s the food was gone in a flash
  stopped in for lunch today with some friends it s a little bit out of the way but i think it s worth the trip if you re in the neighborhood there are two doors and two counters in the restaurant enter on your left for dine in place your order and your food will be brought out to you enter on your right for carry out i decided to order the meatball sub and a side of fries the sub was excellent the bread was soft and the meatballs which are made in house were terrific the fries were average i asked them if they could do some garlic fries and they used garlic salt to season them for me the staff was very friendly and i observed them assisting carry out customers by actually carrying orders out to their cars if this place was closer i d frequent it weekly when i m in the neighborhood i will definitely stop back
  best catfish i ve had definitely a fan of the cajun seasoning i ve yet to eat anythng here thatisn t great authentic southern dishes and service there is a wait but this is due to the food being made to order i m always great with waiting if it means that i am getting fresh food the atmosphere is very welcoming
  better burger fries than in n out but a little pricey for a burger joint with loud music and no adult beverages or dessert i say better than in n out because it s a similar concept of freshly cut fries and grill top burgers with fresh toppings where they excel is the burger patties are bigger and the fries have more flavor
  service is awesome and the food is great nice mexican feel and homey atmosphere
  excellent this is one of my favorite restaurants in montreal and possibly one of the more under appreciated if considering quality of food and nice atmosphere this is what i ve grown to refer to as a chalkboard bistro the menu is provided on a single large chalkboard hung on the wall written in chalk while i m not a big fan of this practice the menu at liverpool house offers an excellent range or options not limiting but also not overwhelming making decisions a bit difficult and leading to a repeat visit everything i ve had here has been very good to excellent but the lobster spaghetti was amazing one of the best seafood dishes i ve ever eaten atmosphere is casual comfortable the staff very friendly knowledgable and helpful
  came here for valentine s day with my boyfriend it was very crowded and we were sitting pretty close to the table next to us but that is to be expected for valentine s day i was just happy to get a reservation this place is pretty in demand for holidays so i ordered the lobster bisque to start and then for my main course i got the petit filet 8oz and my boyfriend ordered the pepper steak 12oz we also got the green beans mashed potatoes and gouda mac and cheese and the butter cake for dessert let me start by saying we got waaay too much food the food here is very filling the lobster bisque was one of the best i ve had it had whole lobster in it and the stock was very creamy i ordered my meat rare and it was sooo good they didn t overcook it and the meat was so tender and juicy all the sides were seasoned perfectly even though it was very crowded for valentine s day then dessert came we were pretty full but we felt like we had to try the butter cake believe me it is worth it it was so moist and delicious topped with delicious berries yumm the dinner was pricey but it was definitely a night i won t forget
  an absolute favorite for breakfast where else can you try a bacon flight with 8 different varieties made in house and served on a pig shaped platter the blt is outstanding and don t forget the bacon donut to finish off the meal oink is a can t miss if you want a unique breakfast experience and lots of bacon
  ambience was awesome 5 stars food was 3 75 and service was 5 stars only con was my prawns was too soggy for my liking great place def recommend it
  it was quite the experience my hubby and i went here before catching our flights back home and it wasn t busy but there were quite a few people there walked into this place and it s a shopping area downstairs and there s an escalator that leads upstair to the restaurant and that s where we intended to go anyway right on top of the stairs there was a guy there who took photos of anyone who goes to the restaurant we got seated right away and because of our time crunch we already knew what we wanted i ordered a grilled alaskan salmon and hubby got the jumbo combo both food was very good especially the mash potatoes that game with my dish they made it with cheese or something similar it was very cheesy my husband s dish was huge or jumbo in this case service was great and the decor was very rocker chique i will come back next time but not on such a time crunch after getting the bill they give you a coupon to shop downstairs pretty cool
  3 piece tilapia very good crispy and not greasy hush puppies were great worth the drive we ll be back for the jumbo shrimp taco
  fast fresh pizza 6 25 for 11 inch one topping pizza or 7 65 for 11 inch with any toppings you can choose your own sauce and cheese friendly staff great service and i will definitely come back soon
  wow del frisco s was simply amazing six of us split 3 orders of their wagyu bone in steak it was so thick and topped with a salty peppery crust looking at the meat reminded me of ahi tuna and the meat melted in your mouth my meal the next day just couldn t compare we also had the crab cakes lobster mac and creamed spinach with bacon tony was one awesome waiter he was very engaged laid back to talk to and accommodated our strange requests great evening great times will come again
  we had a party of 5 celebrating a b day i am giving them 1 star not because of the food it was because of waiting for over 1 hour for our food after an hour of waiting and watching the other par tons leave because they can not wait our appetizers came out then the soup then one by one our dishes came flowing out of the kitchen the b day girl insisted for us to wait because to her the food is one of the best the food was good but not the best was it worth the hour wait no
  now this is what a vegas steakhouse should be like excellent service delicious meal great atmosphere and a stunning waterfall in the distance perfect it was way too hot outside so we opted for an inside seat with a view of the waterfall the crab cakes for our appetizers were divine our steaks mine the filet his the rib eye were both cooked to perfection the creamed spinach just melted in my mouth and the potatoes au gratin was so rich and creamy to our horror we just couldn t finish it all how sad it was to watch them take it away we were too full to have any dessert our waiter was very nice and made the overall experience of the restaurant a memorable last night of our vacation as it should be this is a nice restaurant that prefers their guests to dress accordingly and i ve seen them turn people away nothing irks me more than someone walking into a 5 star restaurant in ripped jeans and a dirty t shirt when everyone else is in semi formal dress make an effort
  this place is great fun atmosphere great fast food and amazing shakes more flavors then you can imagine
  great dinner spot in scottsdale az and with 900 reviews we knew it was a must try spot came here for business and with friends and had a great time the food and drinks were great and the service was awesome i ordered the pork osso buco the portion was fancy restaurant size but every bit was flavorful and satisfying great spot to have a dinner meeting not too loud and given great service by the staff the restaurant is located in a great convenient location where you can walk to various other restaurants or bars
  free champaign and mimosas for sunday brunch until 3 pm nice deal crab legs shrimp and sushi always fresh
  good stuff been to the one scottsdale several times and always enjoyed glad they brought one to the se valley for apps we orders the spring rolls and the pork dumplings the i m in love with the egg rolls at pf changs and these don t really measure up sorry the dumplings were amazing they are steamed and we had them done a bit crispy they were a perfect combination of steamed and lightly pan friend amazing we went with the classic cashew chicken and the kids sweet sour chicken both were great i love this place we passed on desert so no review there
  our server amber was amazing she has such a sweet personality and gave us some great recommendations for the food we will for sure come back here
  this is the best buffet i have ever been to they have all types of food american bbq seafood chinese japanese vietnamese mexican and more the trick to this place is to go right before 3pm because thats when they bring out the dinner food and you can get it for lunch price almost everything is here great but you must get the brisket omg b r i s k e t b o y s the brisket is so good juicy soft and tender i kept getting more like a fiend i actually went here twice and the 2nd time i went i got nothing but brisket crab legs and shu mai the dessert i had was also awesome i got this nutella coffee gelato which was off the hook i told my friend to go get it for dessert and he comes back with a piece of chicken inside of a waffle cone hilarious there is usually a line but its worth it i will definitely be back next time i m in vegas
  i really loved the food the reason i m giving it a 3 they charged all of us more and they also charged us the table because we were a large group calm on that is ridiculous we did love the food and if i come back with a large group get separated tables if not they will charge a lot and also if your not paying all together make sure that you tell them before you pay and they charge what they didn t bring to you
  i stopped here on my way to the airport from my job southeast of phoenix this is probably the best buffet i ve ever had of any type of food and possibly the best indian food i ve ever had in my life i live in tucson where there are a couple adequate indian places but nothing to rival this i think i would even drive to this place from tucson if i had enough of a craving for indian food and a free evening amazing food service etc i ve had tons of indian food all over the country northern and southern style this place is one of the best ever
  for a tuesday night this was one popular spot we had reservations for a party of 4 at 7 15 but our reservation time came and went while we were waiting at the bar we probably would have waited even longer if one member of our party hadn t taken it upon himself to seat us at an empty table he spotted we followed his lead and took our seats at the table and soon were greeted by a friendly waiter thank goodness because after a long plane trip from florida to arizona i was starving i soon had lots of food to alleviate the pains of hunger we started with north s infamous zucca chips for the table as well as a pizza the zucca chips were fabulous a must while dining at north as for my entree i ordered the scallops which came on top of orzo our waiter suggested i also add a few shrimps to the dish as well which didn t turn out to be such a great idea because the shrimp was way overcooked i can eat shrimp for breakfast lunch and dinner but these were inedible the scallops on the other hands were cooked to perfection and the orzo was pretty tasty as well we also ordered a side of organic veggies i m not usually a veggie lover but if veggies were always this good i d be eating them for breakfast lunch and dinner instead of the shrimp i wasn t blown away by the service and or the food but the wine list did look very inviting so i d be willing to go back for a drink when back in phoenix
  i love you bb i don t listen to the children cry all over the page you re perfectly fun and casual i feel i owe you rent for all the time i spend under your roof
  i went there cause i bought their groupon the place is clean and well maintained their staff is okay but the food was yucky i ordered mango lassi it was more of mango syrup and less buttermilk and their malai koftas was still frozen inside which i could tell it came out of freezer and warmed up in microwave rest of the food didn t taste good
  not quite what i expected looks like the old tenant taberna just left their stuff and nimbus put a sign or two on the walls the feel of a pub brewery just isn t there it s definitely not as cool as their tucson location their beer is the same though not my favorite but pretty decent here is the rundown meatball appetizer very good 6 big juicy meatballs and tasty sauce on the side wedge salad huge and reasonably priced but just not that good just had tomatoes blue cheese crumbles and red onions that s it roasted chicken very good pretty juicy and had a nice kick to it service just ok not spectacular our waitress was pretty friendly but i didn t as many diet coke refills as i would have liked and she didn t give us an itemized receipt local dines gift certificate awesome get one before you go because it is so worth it and you can use it for beer http bit ly dfr4eq
  this is the second time i ve eaten here and it was as good if not better than the first the first time i had the meat lasagna and the second time i had the cheesesteak lemme tell you this is one of the best italian places i ve been to in phx it s very back east feel to it and i love all of the authentic italian foods they have there especially the meat cheese and pasta counters check em out you won t be disappointed
  i was going to write a review about hey maybe if you don t like waiting for cheap sushi fuck off i ve changed my mind put in the order for sushi and an egg roll at 6 50 got the food at 7 30 it wouldn t be such a big deal if you didn t see people who came in after you get their shit i m an only child and this the one time i ve felt like a foster child taken into a home that just wanted me for government money here s the thing i was all sorts of boozed up on the happy hour sake bomb at 7 30 when i asked for the check oop got a catch i was soberly pissed off at 7 55 when i actually got the check so here s the deal if you re in a time crunch don t ever go if you like cheap drinks check it out decent sushi cool specials staff doesn t know how to handle more than 2 tables at one time
  this is the best in n out burger in las vegas i have never been to in n out where they have a host that takes my tray and fills my drink i mean who does that at a fast food restaurant
  sunday night in mesa where to go for good pizza that was fairly close to our hotel marriott queens it was and we are happy we did we now live in a city known for its cheesesteaks but the pizza in philly is dang good too this ranked right up there with anything we ve had there we ordered the supreme and it was delicious it was delivered to our table piping hot and aromatic the sausage has a delightful sweetness to it and the red peppers are wonderfully fresh the other ingredients were tasty as well but those two really stood out we had plenty left over for lunch tomorrow the service was timely and professional which is not to say stiff but the right amount of personality and fun i will admit to being a whisker concerned about cleanliness judging by the waiter cashier all around worker dude apron hint david order one in brown or black but our table was clean the floor was fine counter spotless and as the kitchen is not walled off it is easy to see it is clean as well we did not use the restrooms so can not comment deducting a star for a well worn apron would be ridiculous it was a five star evening for us
  i always receive top notch service here pretty good beer selection and the garlic fries are addictive my favorite bar on mill and in tempe
  awesome dining experience the food was great and the service was excellent megan l was my server and she was very friendly and attentive she did a great job and made the experience even better
  so disappointed i called to order pasta and salad and i asked the girl if the spaghetti and meatballs was just like the photo she said yes and that it was good she was more in a hurry to get me off the phone than anything and after over an hour this disgusting dish showed up at my door it was about an entire box of spaghetti noodles with some sort of tiny about of awful tomato sauce and just two dry meatballs awful
  this place really hits the spot when i am craving well season spicy shrimp with a side of corn my whole family loves this place i agree sometimes service is not all that great but it s a hit and miss just like in any other restaurant
  lunch at indian spices on sixth ave was a delight today i walked in got seated immediately was given a large glass of water and was asked if i d like to order off of the menu or partake in the buffet the buffet sounded good to me so without any wait i took a plate off of the table and helped myself to a little of everything if you like flavor in you food you re going to like indian spices everything had some zest to it without being overly so my favorite item on the buffet was the chicken tari it contained large very moist chunks of chicken in a curry like sauce that held a piquancy without being too bold i m no connoisseur when it comes to middle eastern food but my only disappointment from the buffet was the tandoori chicken it was a bit dry and not offering as much flavor as the other dishes and that s a shame since it s usually the main attraction for most westerners who come through the door of an indian restaurant one thing that i notice that i was impressed with is that there was only one person working the dining area she was the sole person greeting customers ensuring everyone s drink was okay busing tables and working the cash register and she made it look easy a lesser experienced person may have gotten overwhelmed but she seemed to have a system remained very pleasant and nothing seemed to faze her my check came to exactly 9 00 plus tip quite a bargain for an all you can eat buffet of quality food in a nice atmosphere the slight dryness of the tandoori keeps me from rating this with five stars but i wouldn t let that deter you from stopping in and enjoying a good middle eastern buffet at indian spices

  i visit chili s with family and friends about two times per month we usually go to the the one at bell and 7th st or 27th ave and 101 the food for the most part is at least average to above average the chips and salsa are a good deal and the green chile and enchilada soups are great the food is pleasingly the same at each chili s we visit however there seems to be an ongoing kink in the service at the one on north valley parkway when they first opened a while back we tried them twice because they are close to home both times the orders were messed up and the waitresses were friendly but not very knowledgeable about the menu the food took forever to arrive and no hint of an apology anywhere a few months later we decide to try again maybe they were just new and by now they have the kinks out again the wait time for our food was incredible and getting a drink refill was just wishful thinking fast forward over a year last saturday nice waitress seemingly nice greeters food was as expected over 90 minutes for soup and salad and water to drink four times with the same problem is probably not coincidence the chilis on 7th st always has the exact opposite great service and normal wait time hope it changes it is a decent place to go
  for a burger joint this place is a keeper we will be back i had the brisket burger with bleu cheese and swiss omg my mouth is watering just thinking of how delicious it was we also ordered a bucket of parmesian and herb fries that was a lot of fries for 4 people we took 3 4 of then home the atmosphere is family friendly and very welcoming the staff was courteous and friendly as well we ll be back soon
  great portions great taste great service i love breakfast food the biscuits and gravy weren t very good but the pancakes potatoes french toast were all so delicious definitely recommend it
  i come to this place often is a small place but looks clean weekends also have menudo authentic mexican menudo
  this restaurant is a heartbreaker it s got great food and their menu is just good enough to justify the really long wait times between courses especially if you are the party ordering a table tasting it s also really expensive 85 per person per table balances out the gigantic 4 person final course of excellently cooked porterhouse the best i ve ever had in vegas and lobster which was done great too the pros the food s delicious and the chefs obviously know what they re doing the tasting menu is amusing and tasty the style of the place is very nice as is aria in general people watching is fun to do while you wait the cons and you will wait the service is very slow even balanced against any tasting menu s normal savor speed you ll be sitting there between the amuse bouche and starter tapping your fingers on the table wanting more the music in the place is blaring loudly and it s just top 40 tunes at 30 decibels more than it needs to be it makes talking normally impossible the place is deceptively expensive it could be so much better if they killed the rock blare and sped up the service the food is great but you can find it a good steak and lobster place anywhere on the strip all in all a middling experience
  this is a good place to go relax and have a drink the bartenders are always friendly and if you do a little gambling the drinks are always comped i wish there was a little more happening here while its fun to have a quiet night out it would also be nice to see a little beer pong or something to bring in a crowed fun place to hang pit with some friends or your gf wife but i wouldn t go here to find someone
  ordered the chicken lasagna which i enjoyed previously except this time the chicken was gray and did not appear appetizing at all i ve been disappointed with this location in the past as well service was good not great they always make you wait when you can clearly see open tables
  the food was great not a carbon copy of other restaurants the staff was really polite and we enjoyed everything
  we eat here a lot love it they are always friendly and know what we want before we order
  you truly can never go wrong with church s fried chicken is it healthy nope but man is it good their flavor for the chicken is just so consistent every time and so tasty their mashed potatoes are also great along with the fried okra the corn has always been bad every time we buy it it always looks so good but every time it s bland and soggy there is a girl that works there that is quite obnoxious she s loud talks to herself and talks randomly to people with the strangest remarks though she s happy you can clearly tell her co workers can t stand her poor girl anyway for the few times we get cfc it beats out any other fried chicken place such as kfc or popeye s
  this place has done me wrong i can no longer bring myself to eat quiche anywhere else because they have done it so perfectly and beautifully right it s soft it s light it s fluffy it s buttery my favorite is the red pepper and goat cheese the chocolate chip pistachio creme filled treats are another go to but please get more real plates and silverware disposable ones are far too much of a waste
  best place in all of phoenix to have breakfast
  awesome pasta with sauce made to order
  this place could have easily had 5 stars they brought my food out to my table the fries were great the burger was big and that is about it had going for it my meat seemed over cooked and dried out i had a huge wedge of lettuce that i had to take off it was so big 60 cents to use a debit card seriously i can not believe that i just paid 11 00 for a bacon cheeseburger frys and drinks and then was charged to pay with a debit card if the prices were lower than maybe i could understand the fee at first glance the restaurant looks clean but as you wait for your food you start to notice the water stained ceiling tiles and tremendous amount of bugs in the lights
  two stars because of the view the food wasn t amazing i think this would be better identified as a drinking spot in fact it probably is a bar turned breakfast in the morning huge menu options but we were on the hunt for breakfast so we didn t go far from the first page i d go back to sip cocktails on the patio and watch the fountain but not for eats
  could have been the best steak ive had ever my ny strip was simply that good amazing their harvest salad was pretty damn good too broiled tomato and grilled asparagus sides were solid but pricey for portion moscow mule was money service was adequate but sub par for price points finished my steak before he ever even checked on us finished my salad before i got my cocktail hate walking into the strip hellhole called harrahs but this is a beautiful location overlooking the strip recommended
  one of several locations in the phoenix surprise glendale area paradise bakery offers primarily sandwiches breads soups salads and pastries all made fresh and daily scales are 1 5 same as yelp ratings atmosphere 5 there is plenty of seating even during peak hours this is not a take your date out type of restaurant but it s not a dump i describe it as somewhere in between the area is clean and there is plenty of parking service 5 you enter the restaurant fall in line one of the employees will ask you what you want you pay at the cash register and you pick up your order the service is prompt and attentive food 4 i have only tried their sandwiches salads cookies and muffins all three are above average especially their cookies there could be more variety in the soup and salad selections but they make up for some of that with the sandwich variety and ingredient control you can buy half sandwich salad or soup combinations and the quality and quantity match and sometimes exceed the price plus you get a cookie with your meal which brings me to their favorite item cookies i am a cookie fiend and their cookies are exceptional soft and chewy fresh and delicious even the cookies they add to the meals are pretty good their muffins are also top notch cost 4 5 their prices do not change from lunch to dinner so a meal during lunch may be relatively costly pros well prepared tasty sandwiches good atmosphere and service well above average pastries cons slightly more costly during lunch needs more soup and salad variety best entrees vegetarian sandwich cookies worst entrees none so far sample size i have eaten here over 3 times in the past 2 years
  this is a higher end restaurant for mexican food so the food may be a bit pricey we came after happy hour which end at 6 30pm when i walked in i was pretty impressed with the design with low light setting only thing is that if a table next to you order anything grill you ll be overwhelmed by the smokey smell we end up ordering combination fajita and fish tacos i was kind of disappointed in the food i think there was only 3 tortilla wraps that come with it in which we end up having to order extra wraps also the wraps is kind of small to fill up all the meats i want in it the taste was kind of bland not much taste unless you dip in the salsa sauce that comes with the tortilla chips same with the fish tacos it was crispy but the fish meat is very bland as for the service it was good we had a friendly waiter guy who s friendly and attentive one thing that stand out is that they serve margarita in a big margarita cup
  i love firehouse subs craving a delicious sandwich this is the place you need to go to their large menu is sure to satisfy everyone and at a reasonable price too my 2 favorites are the club on a sub and the turkey bacon ranch the smell of the bacon cooking is seriously heavenly not only is the food great but so is the customer service so friendly and inviting an extra special treat is going in when george is working he is smoking 5 stars for firehouse
  my go to place especially when i have a major sweet tooth moment i usually come here on my way to work or after work i love love their hot chocolate the nutella macaroons
  nypd pizza was delicious the servers very nice courteous we ordered a large da works pizza and it waas large enough to feed 4 people and still have 2 slices left of course after having a salad the penne pasta we had alicia as a server and she was very nice attentive when we said it was our first time there we were from ca we received free dessert 0 we shared the powdered donuts with chocolate fudge raspberry sauce courtesy of the owner if im ever in az i will definitely go there again highly recommend it
  i was a bit skeptical at first on the taste but their pizza is delicious plus their prices are pretty decent for getting a whole pizza tiny slices though i found out about this place as i drive by it everyday going home for work finally decided to give it a try on my lunch break a couple days ago when i walked in it wasn t busy and the front area is the seating area plus there was no wall to separate it from the business next door which i believe was a yogurt or smoothie shop so i was a bit confused on where the counter to order was kept going back and found the counter placed my order got the pepperoni pizza and saw them make it right then no premade pizzas not sure how long it took but i would guess about 10mins it was a 12 pizza but the slices are small as i mentioned earlier the pizza and crust are thin and the crust got a little black overall taste was better than i expected pizza crust was too crunchy for me though i would definitely recommend this pizza place to anyone looking to try a new pizza place or is in the area i m planning on taking my husband here next time
  another great restaurant by the people that own and operate joe beef again expect massive portions in a tiny setting reservations are a must
  this restaurant had the most beautiful view we left our ordering up to the server and had the most incredible steak and bacon wrapped scallops our server myron was quick and kind even though it was valentines day we will definitely go back
  here to celebrate cinco de mayo it took 45 mins for our food to come out and then it was all wrong it took longer for us to get silverware horrible service tonight food was good but service was not up to par i had a bad service experience the last time i was here too not sure if i will be back
  good salsa but the rest of the food was just so so
  the food here is very good and the prices are excellent i had the fettucine carbonara for only 11 and it was amazing highly recommended if you re looking for good food at a decent price
  awesome little atmosphere food is legit small place away from the strip and it almost makes you forget you are in vegas
  can t beat the pricing plate the food quality has been very good love the chicken wings
  sheer joy being an italian woman and find a place with decent wedding soup lovely entrees and sandwiches
  love the quality and freshness of the sushi here the kabuki roll is a little tricky to handle but presentation and taste make it worth the effort don t miss out on side dishes like the cucumber salad which makes a great refreshing appetizer beware if you sit at the sushi bar the wait staff may reach over you and your food to pick up orders mention it to the staff and they ll hopefully be more careful
  wonderful place for authentic polish cuisine the staff is friendly the food is excellent be prepared to take your time don t be in a rush you will definitely enjoy
  absolutely delicious great selection of sushi rolls we had about a 30 minute wait but it was worth it once seated the sushi was made promptly our waitress also had good recommendations
  so i have been to both postinos not counting the annex in tempe and i have to say i prefer postino central postino has some very good appetizers and sandwich meals as well as some decent soup and salad options but the real reason to come is the wine do yourself a favor an come during happy hour order a couple of appetizers and tell the waitress i never seem to see male waiters when i go what your wine preferences are and let her chose a couple glasses for you repeat the process until you have had far to much wine and call a cab or have a sober friend drive you home all in all a great place to try wines you don t normally find in grocery stores and a nice enough place to take pretty much anyone on pretty much any occasion barring truly fancy special events
  omg horrible service never coming back here again i ve given this place plenty of shots to prove me wrong but it just keeps getting worse and worse this time they took 20 minutes to sit us than another hour for me to get my food the place was not even that busy i m done here
  drove by on a whim and saw it and decided to give it a try absolutely wonderful place extremely friendly staff and excellent owner who cares about his business food was excellent and honestly had zero complaints about this place would recommend it to any italian food lovers great place on the north side of vegas
  sunday brunch was great it was a perfect day to enjoy the good food a sangria and good companionship in the lovely outdoor setting there bread and pesto sauce served prior to the meal is to die for over time i have had many of their menu items all of them pleasing to me this visit i had oatmeal one companion had a very delicious salad i tried it the meal and the surroundings make this sunday a special day i must mention that there was a slight snag with our reservation but the manager genevieve wallick quickly resolved the problem the high quality of the management in this restaurant is defiantly a plus and adds to the overall experience
  the food and ambiance were fantastic we all enjoyed our dinner of albacore yellowtail and salmon sushi chicken yakisoba beef teriyaki a spicy tuna and philly roll and red snapper sashimi with olive oil black pepper and green onions the friendly helpful staff was also a plus i know this wasn t a very descriptive review but i m about to be called to a poker table
  fabulous experience helpful waiter great food and atmosphere entertaining watching food prepared from the bar seats we ordered tapas and untraditional sushi a creative mix of flavors will go back very soon
  this business defies the old adage location location location it s hard to find but oh so worth it you ll know your there because you ll see all the cars the food is actually made with love i had an omelet it was tender and delicious i have never used this term in a review once the manager walked through the resturaunt continuously he asked us how our meal was the staff was happy the customers were happy i was happy i hope you will go and enjoy this wonderful little breakfast lunch place
  great service great food amazing bargain stopped in here for brunch where we grabbed a bite on the outdoor patio would definitely eat again
  never write reviews but have to on this place food was way overpriced for the quality we waited a long time to receive just our house salad when we got our food it was very disgusting bread was stale and food was cold i was so disappointed i wasted 60 on a terrible dinner for my family i
  i don t know where to start most of the reviews are correct the pizza is no good and looks like it s been sitting out for hours i tried about 4 different slices but none of them got more than 2 bites taken out because they were so bad the only slice i actually finished was the oreo dessert pizza the pasta is precooked and they only throw it in boiling water for about 10 seconds to reheat it so the consistency is very mushy and over cooked the only thing i semi enjoyed was the salad bar it s true the lettuce isn t the freshest it was a bit wilted but i still liked it over the pizza and pasta one soda machine was out of order and the other two were out of most of the sodas with the exception of about 4 the service was friendly the girl in the front counter explained the buffet to us and said she gave us a discount for signing up for the rewards program but once we sat at our table there was a advertisement which said it was happy hour and the buffet was already discounted all in all we probably won t be back
  had a nice dinner with my brother and father even though the place was nearly empty at 8pm on a saturday night probably because a fight was in town as far as chains go this was is consistent with every other m s you d visit as always great service
  best greek food i ve had everything was so fresh and tasty ive had many gyros in my life but they are the best small mom n pop kinda place but who cares this is authentic
  there aren t enough words to describe how amazing this place is the food is beyond delicious the potatoes were the best i had ever had the presentation is classic and unique and the service is fast i had everyone eat here the shakes are amazing serving size is large and the wait staff good lord they rock best place
  sls summer menu valid until 31 aug 2015 http slslasvegas com summermenus was here on a sunday about 7 pm happy hour i think 5 pm 7 30 pm was only valid at the bar not restaurant so sat there had the 39 summer menu happy hour 7 katsuya fresh cocktail high recommended and deceptively strong regular price is 15 and the happy hour sashimi sampler for 9 truthfully the philip stark design was my favorite part of the restaurant but the food was great and the cocktail was delicious especially at those prices i ve got 2 weeks left to hit the summer menu at bazaar meat and cleo
  this place is small but had very clean shiny silverware and plates and i was impressed with that i decided to try an entree salad and picked the one that was suppose to be mango glazed chicken it soon came out and the first thing i noticed was the greens were all wilted and dry and warm the greens were topped with a small maybe two oz plain not mango glazed grilled chicken breast that was sliced and very dry the plate was garnished with two sliced grape tomatoes and two half sliced orange sliced the dressing was suppose to be citrus vinaigrette but it was thick and might have been the mango glaze that should have been on the chicken and certainly didn t seem like any kind of vinaigrette almost 2 stars my husband had the shredded beef brisket i tasted the brisket and it was lean for brisket but pretty much unseasoned i didn t try the rice and beans but my husband said they were very good and well seasoned and he mixed the brisket mixture with the rice and beans and said all together that way they were good 3 stars the restrooms are outside i don t know if they are air conditioned 2 5 stars
  i would have given a much higher rating but the nachos we ordered were disgusting they were swimming in the grease from the beef topping i literally poured it off the plate had to ask the bartender for chips because we couldn t eat the ones on the plate because they were mush the minute they arrived made a comment to the bartender who basically shrugged his shoulders found the bar area to be fun and enjoyed the margaritas will give it a second chance but will definitely not order the nachos again it s such an easy fix ordered nachos a million times and never had that issue
  i d say 3 5 stars my barbacoa torta was ok but my bf seemed to like his burrito since it was really meaty don t expect good service from the girl up front though but go ahead and try the food
  the cool setting does not make up for multiple service mistakes wrong dishes being sent to multiple tables the wrong dessert being left at the table etc for the price the entrees are meh this would be a two star review but the cocktails are good enough to ratchet it up one more star i want to like this place more but other restaurants in this town are much better
  delish scallop appetizer lobster ravioli and gnocchi as first course and buccatini special and lamb shank for secondi shame it s closing but we re glad we were able to have the experience before it s gone
  stopped in for lunch and was seated immediately i waited for a full 10 minutes and not one server took my drink or food order i left and will not return to this location they weren t even that busy i am a fan of bbw but this location isn t good
  went here twice in a month both times food was great but the service wasn t so good the first time the waiter was rude and didn t even acknowledge us for 20 minutes and then we paid the bill with a giftcard and he almost kept the giftcard it still had a balance on it we had to ask him for it back which we shouldn t have to do both times though it took forever for the food to come out i ordered the lunch special pizza and tomato bisque and both times half of the tomato bisque was spilled on my plate i just think this yard house just needs to weave out there bad waiters and they will be fine
  i always enjoy coming here i would always come here on a weekly basis because i used to live a couple of blocks away it has a nice ambiance servers are very nice and attentive i always order the garlic short ribs beef panang shrimp pad thai fish herb salad beef sate and thai iced tea to wash it all down with i recently visited this place over the weekend and the menu is updated with a larger selection with photos over the years the place has gotten better and better
  we enjoyed the pizza here we asked for light cheese and definitely glad to have made that request the sauce is very tasty and we will certainly return again the staff was very accommodating to our two year old toddler the garlic knots were a hit too
  quite a nice find rocking an old school diner atmosphere yet the food is anything but much better i had a porkchop garnished with peaches peaches and these amazing green beans would for sure go back
  why the less than subpar reviews i loved everything i got we got the lobster mac and cheese lobster shooter and the lobster roll 20 all of this totaled up to be around 40 bucks but we were so pleased when the meal came to our table they serve hunky chunks of lobster in each order but my favorite had to be the roll because of the mountain of savory lobster inserted into two buttery toast buns get s me so excited great shopping area and quality food in a to go setting i m a fan
  don t know why we like this particular cabo over palace or santa fe locations but we always seem to end up here on our visits back we never seem to get there in time for happy hour but pricewise it s on par with most chain places with a little better quality mom always said don t fill up on chips and salsa before dinner but she never had theirs the spicier the better good enchiladas with plenty of cheese fajitas were tasty too but easy on the onions next time dessert options were so so we just had another margarita instead i m not big into fruit ritas but the strawberry hit the spot one drawback i don t expect every restaurant in vegas to be 24 hours but the best you can do is 9 on weeknights just an idea
  walked in and the seahawkers club had just left the place was a wreck and they were scrambling to get the tables cleaned and the restaurant back in order good service good food and cold drinks use the 4square app and unlock an additional dollar off your drinks even during happy hour
  our favorite mexican place going there for years and never disappointed catering is excellent too
  went to bld last night what a great meal the food is a wonderful healthy portion and so artfully put together but the best part is it taste great great happy hour till 7 pm so that s a treat the staff was charming we will be going back for b and l too
  delicious food absolutely loved this restaurant it was very romantic and we had a wonderful time the food was so good and cooked perfectly we ll go back every time we re in town
  awesome little area was very impressed with their thai chili wings this place is small so the service was zippy and the bartenders were very personal one thing i didn t like is the booth that i sat in along with the rest of them are far way from where the live band was playing it was high tops and a sectional seating that were in front of the band
  i was disappointed i had high hopes i ordered the hawaiian roll yes it was good however the time out took to get my order was unacceptable we were with a large group that took up 3 large round tables you would think that the management would have better prepared for this 2 people at my table had to send their food back due to lack of freshness and incorrect preparation the 18 gratuity they add to your bill its a joke the service was not worth that tip i guess they figure i m getting a tip anyway so service doesn t need to be good getting our bill paid was a nightmare we asked for separate checks they only allow 2 per table well our group was 7 separate checks my portion of the bill was only 21 00 having to pay a tip of nearly 50 for crappy service just killed me not due to the amount but because that tip was not with the service i m giving 3 stars because my roll was good will i ever come back probably not my regular sushi place is bar none hands down number one in food and service
  for bbq i give it a 4 for bbq north of the mason dixie line i give it a 6 this is good stuff between two people we had chicken ribs brisket and pulled pork with most of the available sauces collards chili and coleslaw for me stand outs were the pork with vinegar sauce and the cole slaw but everything was good enough to recommend i will be back any time i m near by
  so disappointed was really looking forward to this restaurant as one of my favorite foods is spaghetti with meatballs was even thinking about coming here for my birthday dinner so so so so glad that i passed on that and decided to get take out here instead the good news is that their chocolate milkshake made from their gelato was one of the best i ve had nice portion size too had to send my take out order back two times before they got it right i m so glad that i checked my order instead of waiting until i got home the first time it was missing one serving of noodles the cheese i requested for the meatballs and the sauce for the noodles the second time it was missing both servings of noodles the second time when i went back to report my findings i stood at the counter with two employees neither greeted me or asked how they could help it took awhile before someone who must have been watching from the sidelines came around the side and tended to me the food was uneventful ordered the classic meatballs with a side of spaghetti and a side of broccoli meatballs were ok except for it seemed like someone had dumped a large handful of salt on it i wasn t able to finish them all because the salt was so overpowering the spicy meat sauce didn t have a hint of spice the spaghetti was cooked perfectly however the portion size was so tiny that it s definitely not enough to put the meatballs on top call it a meal not that it was ever advertised that way i understand it s a side still though it s just pasta and for six bucks i would have liked to see a little more the broccoli was also extremely salty meh
  good tasting dumplings but a bit overpriced what do you expect at hilldale
  if there was a sandwich god it would be earl it s as if god blessed planet hollywood by developing an earl of sandwich open 24 hours of the day to satisfy your lunch dinner and completely intoxicated food fixes after a million visits i m still consistent with the italian sandwich because i just can t seem to get over it salami ham mortadella and capicola ay caramba it s an orgasm in your mouth and the way they wrap the sandwiches in gold foil they re like gold bricks that hold the most heavenly of flavor packed in a sandwich i m drooling just writing this don t let the line fool you it will go by quick because this place is too on point in the end it will always be worth it
  a lot of people should already know a lot about in n out but if you don t i can give a short description the food here is known for it s freshness its food is never frozen the potatoes are cut on site and you ll see them making the burgers fresh they have a secret menu that s not really secret just not displayed they are known for their animal style fries mostly but they have different things you can do like add pickles grilled onions substituting the spread for ketchup and mustard you can also order fries well done which adds an extra crunch to your fries this location is one of the lesser busy locations but can be decently busy depending on the time of day that you visit the service is fast and the store is kept clean if you re in the area take a visit
  las vegas is a city that offers so many different choices when it comes to all you can eat buffets that you have to wonder how some of the lower quality buffets can stay in business since i live in the south west part of town i really wanted to check out the studio b buffet at the m resort i read some of the reviews and many speak about the large variety of options that studio b has to offer there were a lot of negative reviews talking about the long lines disorganization and less than pleasant service but i had to check it out for myself when my husband and i went it was strictly a personal visit and had nothing to do with writing a review or feature story but just to have some down time and enjoy some good food that i didn t have to write about however as you can see it has turned into a writing project we decided to go to what they call the seafood buffet which is on friday saturday and sunday evenings since seafood is something we both adore the line was long and took us an hour to get through to the cashier once we arrived at the end of the stanchions and the next available cashier was finished with their customer we walked up to her and i was told that i needed to get back in line until i was called not only was the comment rude and lacked any form of great customer service her tone and demeanor was anything but friendly smiles were definitely not part of the cashier s uniforms after paying 40 per person which includes all you can drink wine and beer we had to wait on another line until we were seated this took an additional 20 minutes once we say down it took exactly 18 minutes before a server came and asked us what we wanted to drink i kept it simple and chose my usual iced tea with lemon we left the table to check out the buffet and after walking the entire buffet line filling our initial plate and grabbing a beer we arrived back to the table where the iced tea had still not arrived i m going to keep this part of the story short since there is so much more to say bottom line i eventually the iced tea made it to the table and we never saw a refill for the entire time we were there we decided to just leave the food on the plates and go to hash house for dinner the service was horrible my husband and i have both spent over 20 years in the food and beverage industry and we do understand that sometimes you just have a bad day and things don t go well however it was something that needed to be brought to the attention of management i sent a letter into the food and beverage department explaining that the experience was less than desirable in hopes that they would take a look at some of the issues discussed and work on improving them i was promptly contacted back by melissa missy herber the room manager for studio b who was very kind professional and appeared very concerned about the issues at hand she invited us back for dinner on her and explained that the m resort strives to deliver excellent customer service and memorable guest experiences again we apologize on behalf of studio b and the m resort for any disappointment or hardships we may have caused and that we should please accept this email as an invitation for two to join us for the seafood buffet again as i am confident you will leave having the kind of experience the m resort is so well known for your name will be with cashiers please enter through the vip line and let the cashier know that we have your name and they will take care of the rest missy was very correct we would leave with a memorable experience we went back to the m tonight to enjoy the kind of experience that missy said the m resort is so well known for when we arrived at the vip line as stated again there was a very long line once we reached the cashier and i gave her my name she looked in this white 3 ring binder and explained that my name was not on the list and missy was not on property she then asked if i was sure that i gave her my correct name really would i really not know my name for the rest of this review click here http sincitynews org 2012 10 26 studio b buffet at the m resort big on variety does not mean big on quality
  was here to eat on 10 4 before a show at heinz hall i ve heard good things about this place but have never stopped here before so tonight was the night to stop in and check it out and i m glad i did the selection of food is the typical pub style food as you would expect from a bar but their selections were great i thought overall this place is great and will be stopping in again when i m in downtown for a bite to eat great service and all the waiters and waitresses seemed to be on top of their game i would recommend to anyone wanting to check this place out
  overall experience is great i been there three and was happy every time it s a great family atmosphere
  delicious and fresh you feel healthier when you leave all organic and vegetarian recommended
  filberto s 10 near dobson and elliot i ordered a beef burrito and when i got home and took a bite out of it it turned out to be a bean burrito i ate it anyway because i didn t feel like driving all the way back to complain the other part i want to complain about is their website which has a page for complaining but is designed in such a way as to make it impossible to actually send the complaint to the company one of the required fields you have to fill in is the date in order to send the complaint but no matter how you enter the date it comes back with date format seems invalid this effectively makes it impossible to send a complaint now i m actually pissed off enough to actually start a yelp account
  i love a good bagel place i just recently moved into town it was one of the first things i looked for poppy s does not disappoint i got two bagels to go a blt on a salt bagel and an everything bagel with cream cheese for a friend we loved them i am always wary about ordering bacon at restaurants because i cannot stomach the weird limp stuff i m glad i decided to go for it though because this bacon was perfect crisp and they didn t skimp the bagels themselves were perfect and just a little chewy just how i like them
  i was looking to have a nice fancy dinner with some friends and decided that since i was staying at the mgm that i should probably check this place out i didn t want to eat at joel robuchon proper due to budget constraints but i was convinced to try the 3 course meal for about 60 or so i honestly forgot what kind of food i got from the 3 course meal but i enjoyed what i saw i would probably come back again
  i was accompanied by an out of town guest last saturday evening our waiter was robert he was so helpful to us in making our selections and extremely attentive we followed his recommendations and he was spot on we wanted two appetizers and to split the entree we had the beet salad and the corn anglioti delicious the chef was doing a 10 oz not kidding rib eye it was served on a bed of teeny tasty tender baby mushrooms asparagus topped with a very light almost fluffy bernaise not heavy and a bit of crab sprinkled around the plate were tiny crunchy coffee chips so if you took a bite of the steak perfectly med rare mushrooms and coffee chips it literally was an explosion in your mouth such complimentary components that really worked the chef even divided up the plate including the steak for sharing i could not finish my half much to the delight of my friend he was happy to finish to end we had 3 scoops of their homemade ice cream creatively served in a rectangular dish with a thick slice of ice to fit the dish scoops were placed on the ice piece loved it this place is classically scottsdale enveloped by the spectacular royal palms resort a leisurely meal in a truly beautiful setting my friend was impressed
  since outback was packed for days we ventured towards mill and decided on gb i ve always been a fan of gb i called ahead just in case and the girl at the front put us down even though she said there would be no wait you can never be too sure we were seated on the western part of the dining room and we were both kinda worried we didn t think we were going to get any service let alone drinks but our server steven was absolutely great he was in charge of a pretty large section but he made sure to visit each table and take care of everything i would not be able to do that he was great in recommendations and was super knowledgable of the menu i went for the cajun chicken pasta with a golden export beer the pasta was really good it was nice and spicy and had chicken shrimp and sausage the beer was yummy as well steven made sure to check on us periodically and was very nice and could carry a short convo he really made the entire dining experience wonderful a job well done we will be back
  decent for ayce i like the fact they offer cucumber wrapped sushi i just wish they would offer more choices with wrapped cucumber i love getting salmon tuna and red snapper nigiri with a spicy garlic sauce that rocks all their other rolls are standard fair as far as ayce goes waitress was very friendly too
  great new find in henderson nv great italian food desserts homemade cannollis everything is freshly made to order no pre made chicken cutlets here everything cooked in olive oil you don t find that anywhere sauce and bread are made daily had a medium sausage and peppers sub and it was more than enough the bread was amazing
  i was super disappointed with sushi on shea my boyfriend and i split three rolls and he had a beer i ordered a cocktail the purple haze i think and it was not good i asked for a glass of wine instead we got charged for both of the drinks total came to 84 that seemed crazy the lady that was working was super friendly and funny that s the only reason i would give this place two stars and not one
  honestly when i walked in it seemed dark and i was like oooooh nooooo looked at the menu great prices and looked safe then i got my plate and oh my gosh great sushi authentic sashimi with the wasabi between fish and rice fresh and delicious fish definitely a must try when you re in the area
  the god of lvg buffet in my opinion must bow down specially you wynn buffet snow crab legs wine beer selection grilled fish with mango sauce bbq kbbq asianfusion desserts i feel like scoring jackpot every time i eat here d
  my husband and i like this place a lot he has been going to kona for over a decade i have only gone been two times he is a sushi lover i am not but they do offer non sushi foods for the sushi aversive people i especially like their happy hour they have a regular happy hour and then a reverse happy hour which is great since i like to eat later in the night the times i have gone the service has been pretty good the staff was friendly and pretty quick with service i think the decor downstairs is beautiful it reminds me of nice restaurants in las vegas this place will soon be one of our favorite eating venues
  new asian fusion spot now open on the east side complete with a pun ny name they have thai and chinese staple dishes for the traditionalists and some fun specials too you can get any number of thai chinese dishes here and they re fairly solid the pan fried potstickers great dipping sauce and crab rangoon really light on the cream cheese are made fresh daily but my usual picks are the egg foo yung or the crispy pork with chinese broccoli my guy often opts for the orange chicken chow mein or the wor won ton soup giant portion if you re feeling more adventurous they offer some fusion specials i ve enjoyed the thai rrito the thai deviled eggs and the mongolian beef hash and eggs snag the garlic cheese fries during hh beverages thai tea thai coffee torani fruit smoothies blended frappes milk tea flavored teas and great honey boba try the turbo frappe for an unbeatable caffeine rush family owned and operated with attentive and friendly service everything is made to order so call ahead or using eat24 small stage area in the back for performances and special events hh specials available 11am 3pm and they give teachers emt police firefighters etc 10 off with id all day every day december 2015 edit they ve pared down the menu and are trying out a sushi tuesdays special
  just got back from four peaks i had a good amout of patron so dont judge if i dont spell things correctly anyways it was good beer fabulous atmosphere great service aahh once our server finally noticed us she was great but when i sit for 5 minutes without anyone looking at us i get a little annoyed over all i will go back and you should try this spot too
  oh ichiza how we missed your extensive and affordable menu and how we missed your honey toast such a simple item that we thought would be easily found in california or even replicated at home but we were wrong raku may have the new title as the best japanese restaurant in vegas but you are still one of the top izakayas around and your extensive hours make you a winner oh and you even accept amex so cool
  definitely the most unique asian restaurant i ve been to if you go with a group just order a bunch and share it family style the food was delicious and the service was very fast i recommend the braised pork the soup dumplings the dan dan noodles a little spicy and peanutbuttery and absolutely get the egg buns for dessert i would definitely go again the portions are decent but not huge and the prices are very reasonable
  when you find yourself in the more upscale casinos in vegas you ll often find yourself pressed to find affordable food secret pizza in the cosmpolitan is always a fan favorite but sometimes you just want to try something out enter five50 i find the line in secret pizza always really intimidating when i m just really hungry for a quick slice and five50 located in aria is a great alternative lines are never really long and pizzas are just as great what secret pizza lacks in variety five50 offers more unique flavors still i would say the price has something left to be desired 5 50 is a bit hefty for a slice of pizza and although it is a large slice i can t say i was all too happy parting with my cash nonetheless still a very solid pizza place and it definitely is worth checking out if you re ever sick of secret pizza and looking for a change of pace i would just raise one caveat though beware of the soda prices i was looking to grab a quick can of soda and the price ended up being 10 for the combo of a slice and soda lo and behold they charged 4 50 for a can of soda whereas i don t mind getting ripped off if offered in tap it s nearly criminal to try to take that much from a can i can get from a grocery store 2 3 sure 4 50 please no tip get your sodas elsewhere
  veggie quesadilla was amazing perfectly spicy and sour cream came with it good beer decently priced i ll be back if we re in the neighborhood
  this is one of those restaurants that you will probably never go to unless someone tells you to go there so i am telling you go it s so different and unique you have to go with an appetite because the menu is large and inviting i mean the appetizers section alone could satisfy me for dinner we tried the focaccia and peasant platter but the rest of the menu especially their chicken plates is amazing i had to debate between pasta which i really wanted to try and the caper chicken it was fresh and flavorful and the portions were huge next i want to try the pitas the menu is so authentic and the environment is casual yet special you feel like you will never go to a place like this again and that s because you probably won t i went on a date and it was so surprising and not what i was expecting it s a little pricey but i feel well worth it this is no chain restaurant you could go for lunch with friends or a nice dinner and that s what i love about this place i will keep going back
  very friendly with great coffee and customer service locally owned and operated so stop by and support your local businesses
  amazing food and fresh this is 3rd time i ve been here for my lunch their carne asada fries are amazing and i get their carne asada burrito quality is great prices are higher but so worth it and they do have a senior menu
  greenland closely resembles la s korean markets except that its selection is much smaller it sells pretty much all the brands and items i normally purchase but nothing beyond that i like their ready to go side dishes kim bab rice rolled in seaweed fresh oxtail and greenland brand dumplings in the frozen section i was bummed out today because i got there too early and they didn t have the kimbab i usually come out here 1 2x a month because it s a long way from henderson i usually have to stock up on galbi shabu shabu beef and black pig pork belly i would have given this place 4 stars but the customer service stunk i had to bag my own groceries when there were plenty of employees around i don t mind bagging groceries but i was irked that everyone acted like they were too good to bag groceries and didn t help another cashier out lastly the food court is a bit overpriced so i m hesistant to eat there unless i m really desperate for korean food i m glad that there is actually a korean market around here but i wish it was closer so i could get my kimbab fix
  a screaming circus of children and poor service combined with cold food and over cooked fries i could have went to mcdonald s for this
  update 5 2 14 came in for lunch today with my brother in law one thing we didnt realize was the size or lack thereof of the menu if you are looking for more food other than burgers pot roast and appetizers you will be pretty disappointed the menu is single page with the entire back side dedicated to boozin it up i didnt want the same thing as last time but i definitely wanted more options than whats there i know i know eye candy restaurant but as lovely as the waitresses are a restaurant should have more on the menu than that on to the food this time i had a ranch chicken sandwich with spicy fries the sandwich was tasty but the pico de gallo on the sandwich was more onion than tomato so i was a little over aromatic fries were good decently crisp and hot our waitress wasnt as friendly this time as far as any servers go when asking if we wanted refills she didnt make eye contact no personalization to the meal just how was it would u like your check etc very cut and dry as if she was having a bad day sad to say had to downgrade my rating this time im not expecting a gourmet meal but i do expect service to not seem like a burden especially that early into the day will re evaluate again later
  first absolutely the best service i ve had ever we tipped her 50 she was that good the biscuits are better than flying biscuit s salmon cakes were flavorful veggies were perfectly flavored good experience all around
  i wish chris would come up to san francisco and open a resturant i cannot find pizza here that s even near the same level of his wood fired pizza s you do need to show up at bar bianco about 2 hours before you want to eat but it s worth the wait the bread the salads the wine and the pizza all fresh and tasty and damn i can t wait to visit az again
  tacos are small and the flavor isn t worth 2 each either the flavor gets better or the tacos get bigger the food here was really good i don t know what happened
  compared to kanda and odaki i think sushi palace is better i believe they have recently renovated the place looks really zen there seems to be a stage area near the front window however there were no live bands playing while we were there maybe it s a karaoke stage on the weekends but i serioulsy have no idea why they have that the sushi is pretty standard they have a couple of fancy rolls like tango mango which is only available during weekend it s pretty good the sashimi is also very fresh spicy salmon and spicy tuna is better here than at kanda and odaki which i think everyone pretty much orders the non sushi menu is pretty standard too nothing really impressive miso soup was meh i did like the garlic shrimps very much some maki rolls do make an impression like the new york which has shrimp tempura and sweet potato inside maki printemps which is rolled in rice paper dancing eel which has eel on top and salmon inside rock n roll which has no rice and rolled in cucumber i like this place and will be going back it s not the greatest but it hits the right spots for me
  whenever i fly back to arizona about twice a year i drive straight from sky harbor to san carlos bay for fifteen years i have kept this tradition the chips and salsa are perfect mariachis drifting around real families and workers on their lunch breaks all the seafood is perfect especially the ceviche the soups are amazing for the kids i get fried shrimp with french fries and they re the best fried shrimp you ll ever eat flying into phx i dream of this and am never disappointed a cold pacifico beer with those tiny tart mexican limes and a whole fried snapper endiablados style the neighborhood looks like a place you d go to pawn your grandma s walker or sell a hot catalytic converter but inside san carlos bay you ll think you re eating on the square in guymas
  i eat here about once a week as they are one of few places that will deliver to my office they usually accept online orders through grubhub but some days you have to call in to place a delivery order first i love the service my delivery gal is always friendly and smiling when she brings my lunch they can be busy during the lunch rush so if you have to call in be patient as for the food i don t really know what to say it s an all around good hot dog the poppy seed bun is soft and fresh but the last couple orders i got a regular bun not bad but not the yummy poppy seed bun i was expecting you have your choice of toppings and i ve never had them get my order wrong their chili is pretty good too try a chili cheese dog one day the french fries are worth going for by themselves i love the fresh cut flavor that doesn t even need salt but really who eats french fries without salt anyway the onion rings are consistently good and not too greasy get a side of ranch for dipping the fries will be even better the pizza puff was a little weird the one day i tried it it was like a pizza version of a toaster strudel or a giant totino s pizza roll like i said it was weird but it tasted like pizza give this place a try and then keep coming back the price can t be beat for the quality
  chicken pita and a fry all you need best fries with a little salt the chicken pitas are always on point their greek salad lacks a little seasoning but still pretty solid good spot for a quick 10 dinner their garlic bread is good as well
  great food i had the chimi special grilled chicken covered in a cheese sauce came with rice beans and shredded lettuce on the side couldn t eat the whole thing took the rice and beans home excellent my third time here and all very good
  does anyone expect a lot from a chinese buffet should they there were excellent ones in washington dc so i know they exist should i temper my review with the knowledge that most chinese buffets are far inferior to this one does that make this place any better sigh i don t even know where to begin the place is not disgusting inside if you want to call that neat or well decorated i don t know if you can i don t think i d go that far servers are fast and attentive with drinks and clearing plates you have to appreciate their hustle the majority of the items on the buffet are absolutely unequivocally ordinary if your mission is to eat as much food as possible for as cheaply as possible this would be an excellent place to do it seafood is especially fishy and most items seem as if they ve had a long life under the heat lamp mongolian bbq which i m a fan of is a low frequented item here and the veggie selection illustrates this clearly there are maybe 5 roughly chopped vegetable choices a confusing selection of sauces and a couple trays of meat melting in front of you not terribly appetizing and the final product is as lackluster as you d expect the only true deal is the sushi of which you can eat copious amounts of and have prepared for you fresh and on demand it s not exceptionally good quality but at a place as low ticket as this it s a welcome addition to see something being made fresh for you would not go back and the result of reading many of the reviews here leads me to believe that if this is supposed to be the best of the bunch i might as well give up hope on the concept of the exceptional chinese buffet in phoenix altogether
  this place is like going over to moms house everything is simple and excellent i had the chicken fried steak for dinner which was great the mashed potatoes are the real deal mashed reds with the skin mixed in i was so grateful to find a place to get a good meal like a breath of fresh air
  after visiting the marche we stumbled upon this place looking for breakfast brunch we ordered randomly from the menu the norwegian croissant and casserole and were completely surprised the eggs were perfectly herbed and seasoned the fruits were brightly fresh the toast and croissants were buttery and the salmon was flavorful along with the artful presentation and fantastic service this little cafe was a hidden gem
  this place was good good food good service good good good but pretty nondescript for me it was also really dead the night we ate there which is kind of surreal when you re on the strip but i imagine that may be a bonus for many
  stopped in for lunch after bragging about the one near arrowhead food was good but the very bad service basically ruined the meal ordered the brussel sprout beet salad with dressing on the side no dressing had to flag someone down could not get more coffee had to continually flag someone down to get something and it was an early lunch so there were very few people there waitress was not attentive at all in my opinion a side note i do not think it is sanitary to leave plates of bread uncovered out on tables in the patio area with no one seated there gross that may save the servers time but not healthy
  food was very disappointing and not good definitely will not come back here would suggest trying somewhere else for 31 a person even my freakin 10 yr old omg really only thing i liked was crepe station and the desserts a 140 bucks for family of four is ridiculous plus variety and selection sucked go to rio trust me
  free parking wish i did my research i walked in freezing from my walk and was immediately seated my server ben was fabulous he suggested two different teas out of their plethora of loose leaf i chose his suggestion of lemon ginger this actually tasted closer to lemongrass white tea so if you re not a fan stay away from that i tried the breakfast bar roti with chicken this take on the breakfast burrito is a great idea it had a rocket style salad on top to give it a little more savory while tasty i would try it again with shrimp i closed my meal with peppermint patty warm up tasty drink with peppermint schnapps i will come back again and try another dish i d recommend coming and go for breakfast regardless of the time of day
  amazing delicious i eat way too much of it they have shiner bock on tap which is another plus yes it s a wait so go with a group of friends and order some pitchers while you wait or get take out or delivery if you don t have time to be social but don t miss the goodness
  this place just opened up about a week ago and i think it s a great addition to the indian restaurants in the valley my husband and i went to eat dinner here last night and even late on a monday it was crowded beware it s a small space so if you are going on a weekend i would call for reservations the restaurant located next to the india plaza on apache blvd is really inviting it s decorated with bright colors nice thick tables and contemporary lights and wall hangings it has quite a different feel than most indian restaurants in the valley it has fun upbeat music playing too although i think it could have been turned down a little to make it easier to talk i loved the menu because it is quite varied offering the usual suspects as well as some different items like goan fish curry bitter melon curry goat curries and gobi manchurian and it also serves chaat my husband and i however decided to stick with the more typical offerings for the night he got the la jawab kadahi gosht which was lamb pieces and veggies in a spicy yogurt sauce it was seasoned really well and delicious i ordered the malai kofta which was also delicious and seasoned just perfectly the rice and naan we ordered were tasty and i loved the side of raita instead of just a simple yogurt and cucumber dish that the restaurants around here typically serve this raita had some veggies mixed in and i think little puffed wheat pieces yum all the food comes in copper bowls and plates too which i love the service was quite friendly albeit a little slow it took a while to get our food however we felt that was more to do with ironing out some first week kinks rather than an indicator of anything more serious if you like indian food i would definitely recommend giving this place a try
  those of us from hawaii taste the difference between mainland style and local style chinese food these cooks are definitely from hi all the sauces broths and recipes are so familiar warms the homesick soul
  cheap food family owned good mexican beer and even authentic desserts careful not to overload on the orders though this food really isn t all that good the next day
  my friend absolutely loves this place and first took me to the one in henderson at first i just thought it was ok but then i tried their white pizza i was hooked and now that is a must order for me every time this is very thin crust pizza cooked in a coal oven so it isn t what most people are used to and some may be disappointed if they are looking for more chicago style pizza i agree with the other posters that their non pizza menu items are just ok the salads are fairly plain and the desserts are just so so but the pizza is fantastic it could be a little cheaper but their price point is fair considering the portion size
  excited to come back for a second time enjoyed my sashimi which i m always hesitant to order the first time at a sushi restaurant good service
  okay so it took me a while to get to this place it s normally always closed when im in the area but finally my seester i made it the place is located in an old taco bell bulding the retro type so you can totally enjoy the outside patio without much outside interference we arrived just before the last hour was up so we got seated right away unfortunately the momentum of the servers was already exhausted because it took about 45 minutes for our breakfast and it took about half that time to place our order there wasn t ever anyone around except for the bussers who didn t speak a lick o english or so they pretended we even overheard two other tables complaining about not being approached for drinks or the initial order for 20 minutes and we couldn t help but laugh at how long they would be there after placing their order the food was deo but my sister had to go hunt down syrup for her stack i noticed the bar a little too late next time we will sit there it looked as though those servers inside knew what they were doing i asked for coffee with a lot of cream got the coffee with room for only 1 creamer no cream and i had to get into a spanish convo with the busser because she didn t understand cream totally forgot to ad the a and say creama my bad i must say that the prices are good the food looked and tasted good after it finally arrived just don t expect to have a server you ll have to bring in your own condiments and fetch your own coffee dang they must have had a phat breakfast received lotso tips that day because by the time we arrived they had all quit for the day it was a totall out of body experience for them i m sure because i seen people wearing the uniforms if you go visit this place make sure you arrive just as the crowd is winding down not much later or you ll have to don your apron update just found out aaron may owns this restaurant funny thing is at his other place they are outstanding when it comes to customer service
  this is my 100th review and i am glad i can use it for a place that deserves this recognition and honor i ve eaten here twice by now and both times we used the 100 restaurant com coupon in fact that s how we found the place we wanted to find a new place and looked at restaurant com for restaurants for our vegas trip this place had great reviews so we picked it our experience was so wonderful the first time last year that we went back this year again i just can t say enough good things about this restaurant the decor the lighting in other words your first impression is already up for a good start everything is beautiful warm and subtle including the menus their wine list is simply amazing they have all varietals you d like for every budget josh is very knowledgeable about wine and has great recommendations he even let us taste a couple selections by the glass as we were hesitant what to get he gets good reviews here and i can vouch for that he s very professional yet friendly and funny amazingly helpful and simply charming the first time after we decided what we wanted to eat i noticed that at the bottom of the menu they were offering a 3 course tasting menu for a discounted price and it had exactly what we wanted i can t remember what exactly they were but i know i had the sae bass and my roommate had the steak and everything was just wonderful this time last month we had the oven roasted stuffed tomato my roommate doesn t like tomatoes but i ordered it for myself and we still shared it and he loved it in fact after dinner he said that the stuffed tomato was probably the best dish that night since i don t eat red meat i ordered the sea bass again but it never disappoints it s always perfect tenderly juicy yet flaky just wonderful the shiitake mushroom and asparagus garnish is also very flavorfully prepared i had the new zealand sauvignon blanc with my fish my roommate had the 10 oz filet mignon and he loved it they 3 different salts they give you are all amazing i just used it on my bread but one of them can t remember which really goes well with the steak he had a syrah that he just loved you would think that the portions are not that great but with a 3 course meal you really get stuffed we ordered 2 desserts and they were also just mouthwateringly wonderful i wish i could have ordered one of each of the desserts but i couldn t have eaten them all but any desserts we had there was both time amazing i can t remember the names of the two ladies who helped josh out but they were also delightful as i said earlier i can t praise this place enough both times everything was top notch the food the wine the service everything i can t understand why this place is not more crowded we actually like this fact anyway do yourself a favor when you re in vegas try envy you will not regret it
  went in for the first time last night and all the dishes we ordered were amazing great japanese flavor and some fusion tastes i ve never had before were facinating it was happy hour then so we could try many different items on the menu cheaply i also want to compliment on decors on food especially that yellow sauce on yak udon it makes dishes look even more delicious i would definitely go back for more food
  had an awesome lunch waiter had no personality hard to hear and zero energy the shave ribeye cheddar was amazing
  great brunch not a huge menu but it covers most of the essentials and they have daily specials when i ordered an omelet with no cheese and it came out with cheese in it the waiter didn t hesitate to have it corrected friendly service and soothing atmosphere will bring me back again they have cool wallpaper i never thought i d say that about a restaurant even with all the construction on elizabeth parking across the street and walking over is a breeze
  i ve been to this bar about once a week for the last couple months or so it s nothing special but for some reason i can t stop going back the bar has a great happy hour from 4 7 as well as a few daily specials tuesdays until 10 pm offer 2 bottled domestic beer 1 50 tacos as well as cheap margaritas and mojitos i believe there are also specials on monday nights when they offer karaoke the one thing i will say is that they don t offer any draft beers something i look forward to when going to a bar although it is a bar there is no smoking in the actual establishment which is always a con in my opinion but for the smokers paradise cantina has a decent sized patio which is great on the rare occasions ha there is nice weather in las vegas i usually go on a tuesday or wednesday night so it s never very busy service has always been great waitresses are friendly and drinks come out quickly i ve only had the nachos to eat but they are delicious overall it s a nice bar to go to when you re on that side of town it has decent prices but they aren t prices that you wouldn t be able to find at any of the other bars near the unlv campus
  stopped by here last night for dinner the guava margarita did not disappoint as it was as delicious as how i remembered it from my first visit we ordered the shrimp ceviche de camaron and the enchilada de pollo the ceviche came in a tiny portion with a few plaintain chips on the side for 11 it was as unimpressive as a ceviche can be do not get this item if you come here unless you want to be disappointed max said the enchilada was the best he had ever had but he said that about everything so caveat emptor it is best to come here for happy hours and chug a few margaritas down with friends
  i should disclose that when i ate the food from this establishment someone had picked it up so i cannot comment on the service the restaurant or anything like that my commentary is exclusively about the food i loved it i don t even know what else to say the cole slaw which i think is difficult to get just right was delicious the ribs were meaty dripped delicious sauce and were the most flavorful ribs i ve had in the longest time the chicken which i only sampled from my friend s plate was absolutely perfect it was one of those instances where you eat something so good and so filling that you re truly just happy i mean it was a lot of food and it was all so good cannot beat that combo my only suggestion other than to make sure you try to ribs is that you have a ton of napkins available or maybe don t scarf it down like i did
  the freshest sushi i ve ever had will definitely go back
  great place if you want all you can eat korean bbq huge parking lot fast seating good atmosphere great service and food you will not be disapointed with this restaurant all you can eat is until 10 00pm
  the food is the best food i have ever ate the price is good refers to what you get the service is kind and you feel like a vip guest we ordered the pargiot and the schnitzel and it was amazing one of the most joy able places i have been at
  was one of the best steak houses i have been to great attention to detail waiter was fabulous and the bone in rib eye was superb highly recommend this place the wine list was one of the better ones i have seen also
  beer list is extensive and impressive not a fan of beer try building your own old fashioned not sure what they put in the batter for the fried curds but they are addictive the food is always awesome the green bay chili is a good choice on cold winter nights love the supper club vibe reminds me of the bulk of the restaurants back home between lake winnebago and lake michigan tip order all four of the dipping sauces cheese curds and the potato chips to share
  monster portions best club sandwich and the coleslaw is delicious would recommend you try this if you fancy a change from the normal takeaways o
  love going to this place always has interesting music playing a hostess up front and greets you upon arrival and the sushi is incredible their happy hour prices are super low and you can get loaded up with food and some drinks at a fair price i highly recommend getting the yummi roll the name holds true tucked back off of frank lloyd wright i have eaten here several times and will continue to frequent them
  to all west coast tofu eating tree hugging hippies please stay out of my beloved white castle all you do is slow me from getting my crave case i can not begin to understand how someone could evaluate a white castle as if it was some kind of high end steakhouse 1 white castle is not an east coast thing the first white castle was opened in wichita kansas 2 there are none west of the mississippi 31 in missouri one in vegas and 68 in illinois which sits on the east side of the great river i say close enough eat them sober why a shot of tequila should come with four ingredients tequila lime salt and a whitie a twelve pack of beer should be called a twenty pack twelve beer and eight sliders if it was up to me i would add one more option to the menu grind up all the west coast castle bashers mix them with the beef and call it the west coast whitie go back to your over rated in and out burger
  do not order from here i waited 1h 30m for my food and the wrong order arrived missing tons of things it took them another 1h 30m to deliver the rest
  sacks omg i had them for the first time back in 2011 the art of sandwicherie is correct every time we go back we try something new but this one is a house favorite sack s symphony turkey breast bacon avocado tomato alfalfa sprouts cream cheese and mayo on 12 grain bread
  terrible truly awful i guess the idea is to give you really heavy food for when you re either drunk or hungover but i d imagine i d just puke if i was the latter and i don t think any level of the former would make these sandwiches actually taste good i m pretty sure this place was thought up by some stoned frat boys dude you know what would be really sweet right now a sandwich but with a donut for a bun with fries not on the side but in the sandwich and mozzarella sticks and bacon stuffed in for good measure bad frat boy bad avoid avoid avoid
  went to dinner with a crowd of yelpers which is guaranteed to be a good time but one never knows how the food will be a tiny hole in the wall usually turns out to be the best place to go and this one did not disappoint we practically took up the whole place but that didn t hinder the service i tried the gulpi a cauliflower dish cooked with a unique blend of spice and seasonings i m no vegan but it was the perfect meal for me but just to get some variety i ordered a chicken samosa like an empanada but different texture to the dough another winner along with some tips about farmersonly com fellow yelpers jennifer and eirich shared a few tasty bites of their mantoo dish it reminded me of beef ravioli swimming in tomato and drizzled with yogurt sauce everything was good the portions were large and the prices are low another successful adventure with the supper club
  great inexpensive food the only downside is the limited seating but i suppose that s part of its charm
  great place for some new mexican style food i had the habanero cheeseburger and it was insanely hot and delicious it s one thing to just be hot but this had awesome flavor i highly recommend this burger if you can handle it
  this is where pseudo hippies and eco yuppies cluster to drink coffee and cultivate awareness
  this archi s location at village square sahara ft apache is located directly next to the movie theatre recent expansion of this finely decorated thai restaurant offers a nice bright and open dining room always friendly and efficient service the food is always delicious e g pad thai panang spicy basil po tak soup mango w sticky rice jasmine tea more i prefer the original location on w flamingo better but when in the lakes and craving thai food this is the place to be tip dried chilis are usually hotter in the summer so you might consider asking your server about your rating 1 to 10 15 20 etc prior to ordering tip 2 they are closed on tuesdays might considering calling just to make sure
  sure the place is a giant gimmick but its a fun gimmick and for what it is they do it well enough the food is what you would expect from a diner and it really isn t bad at all my boyfriend loves the shakes i can t do much ice cream so i haven t had one on certain days of the week they have awesome deals for kid s meals one other thing that impressed me about 5 diner was found on their website first they have all of their nutritional information available but even more impressive is they have a menu for gluten free choices as well as lactose free choices very cool in my opinion
  great burgers maybe because i was drink but i liked what i had turkey burger with everything on it
  i had heard nothing but good things about roka akor so i was excited to dine there last friday it is a japanese restaurant located in central scottsdale that features sushi and robata grill robata reminds me of a certain song by styx but i was willing to roll with it anyway besides bon appetit recently named them one of the top 10 sushi places in the u s so we owed it to ourselves to check it out happy hour there were four of us dining and we started off in the bar area to take advantage of happy hour before sitting in the formal dining area the look of the lounge is sleek but pretty generic if ikea offered japanese themed interior decorating roka akor would probably be their main customer nothing bad about that but it felt a little sterile to me our server was very pleasant and she was attentive without being annoying happy hour drinks were well priced 3 beers 6 wine and martinis with a decent choice of libations the standout was probably the saketini my girlfriend ordered simple drink done well they also offer shochu which is like a japanese vodka but nobody tried it this go round the happy hour food menu is a nice size and reasonably priced 2 7 we ordered the crispy fried squid spicy sashimi salad and 2 orders of the butterfish the plate sizes were enough that everyone got some of each everything was fresh and tasty with the butterfish being the favorite dinner we finished our happy hour drinks and made our way into the dining room the first thing i noticed was the noise it was about 7 30p and the dining room was maybe half full but the sparsity of the decorating mixed with very tall ceilings meant all the various conversations echoed off everything do not expect a cozy meal with conversation you can easily hear if the place is full our server was nice enough but seemed a little out of sorts as if he were new or nervous the wine list was a bit disappointing with very few worthwhile bottles under 50 there is good wine to be had but be prepared to pay for it wine markup was anywhere from 2x 3 5x retail ordering our wine was a bit of a process as they were out of a syrah i wanted off the main list and the alternatives suggested by the server and the little too annoying sommelier were not doing much for us i finally went with a 2006 canonball cabernet sauvignon fruit forward cab that paired well with dinner the menu is split into different areas appetizers sashimi sushi tempura and robata grilled items sides and entrees as seems to be the current trend entrees are served a la carte no sides as a group we decided to order several things and share them we picked items from all over the menu so there were a mix of small plate and large plate items one thing to note is that the food arrives very quickly and it seems to show up in a random order we were expecting apps and smaller plates to appear first but it was a hodgepodge of apps and entrees a few minutes later more plates of food arrived before we were even done with the first round the table was crowded to say the least the presentation of the food is excellent and you can tell the chefs take pride in their creations food highlights sashimi chef s selection this was amazing the chef chose tuna scallops and yellowtail and it was seriously the best sashimi i have found in the valley robata grilled asparagus tasty soy glaze and grilled perfectly to crisp tender robata grilled lamb cutlets 3 very nice sized lamb loin chops grilled medium rare and served with a korean chili sauce these were a big hit at the table roka akor rice hot pot what a nice surprise this was a cast iron pot filled with mushroom infused sticky rice very savory and just amazingly good we scraped every last bit of it out the only issue was it took so long to arrive compared to the other food that we thought they forget about it food lowlights spicy tuna roll this was surprisingly boring for a spicy roll beef tataki with salad greens and chili ponzu this was a letdown should be renamed miniature beef roll ups with zero character instantly forgettable japanese eggplant tempura slightly overcooked and very bland even with the supplied sauce final take roka akor is bound to be a scottsdale hotspot it has that generic hipster vibe to it that just seems to pervade many scottsdale eateries the food they do well is excellent and easily eclipses the lackluster items stick with their signature dishes robata grilled items and the sashimi and you will be pleased i d also recommend asking your server to space out the food orders a bit to allow you to enjoy each course a bit more i will be back again but i may just hang in the lounge area next time it s a little quieter and the seating is bit more intimate plus i still need to see what the shochu is all about
  this place is small like two and a half booths small on a sonoran winter afternoon this could be troublesome as a cool draft of air will slither in every time somebody opens the door no fountain drinks beyond that the menu is pretty huge considering it s such a teeny space pizzas ranging from small personal pizzas and running the gamut up through a big 24 monster the prices are respectably decent no price gouging the day i went i had a meatball sub with fries which was one of the many lunch specials they offer it was 5 50 but an even 6 bucks with tax not bad at all the male cashier who i assume is also one of the owners wasn t all that personable but he wasn t rude he just seemed like he would rather be in the back doing anything other than manning the register when the female cashier returned which i am assuming is the other owner she was very nice and hospitable she checked on me a couple times to make sure i had everything i needed i m not the biggest meatball sub freak but every once in a while i ll get the urge to take one on i m glad i did today it was great everything was served piping hot if anything i would say the sauce could be a little more flavorful but it s not anything that would keep me from ordering this same sandwich again this place is in the strip mall shopping center that also houses albertson s chen s chinese and az hair company check it out
  definitely the bang for buck value of las vegas it seems like most of the buffets are terribly expensive or total dumps this place is generally reasonably priced maybe a tad expensive on weekends but nowhere near what you pay on the strip but i can t get over how clean it is yes you won t find fancy seafood but what they do have won t make you sick and generally tastes pretty good
  i actually only recently paid my first visit to red lobster as i have just begun to enjoy seafood i enjoyed my experience although i was expecting a little more the appetizer we had was awesome but our entrees were just ok the service could have been better and i wasn t that impressed with the atmosphere i did enjoy my meal even though i didn t love it and i probably will be back to see if they can impress me yet
  busy place over price but is like the strip for mexican lol a few ilegal activities inside and outside go figure it gets duper pack on weekends am wondering if the firemarshals keep track of buldding codes for occupancy and the health department on sanitation steps of services why i give 4 stars the food super good a cording with my inlaws lol team work tables got turn under 90 seconds but 3 for 33 of tomato juice for a beer preparada or michelada once again the pay top on that place wondering went was last time some agency pay a visit to that place atf ice dea or just the snhd ok hate this review u know i m rigth
  amazing dessert section would give 6 stars for that food choice is amazing and there s so much to choose from something for everyone at the buffet took away a couple of stars as the lady who was showing people from the line to the seats we went as a group of 5 was pretty rude to our group lousy service after paying top dollar leaves a bad taste in the mouth no matter how amazing the food is
  we were staying at flamingo and didn t want to go to the hotel buffet or coffee shop for breakfast so decided to try something different and come here this restaurant has 3 levels and breakfast was only served on the 3rd level the great thing about that is it is outdoors and you have a great view of the strip i had eggs benedict and it was ok wasn t the worst i ve had but it wasn t the best either it was busy the atmosphere was nice the service was ok and the food was ok for the price the great thing is that if you are a total rewards member players card for the harrah s family which included flamingo you get 20 off breakfast at jimmy b s and 10 off anything in the retail store not sure if i d come back for breakfast but one day i do want to go back for some margaritas and good music
  love love love it i had the half combo which is a sandwich on sourdough w salami mortadella pepperoni provolone and i asked them to hold the ham comes with their house italian lettuce mayo and mustard absolutely delicious after i finished the 1 2 sandwich i decided to be daring and grab a piece of the cheesecake which was to die for i haven t had a slice of homemade cheesecake in a long time the staff was so nice and friendly and the locale was very clean and tidy i think i found a new fave spot
  love this place the pho is amazing very affordable and who else has love music on monday discovered this place thanks to a group i paddle on the marina first came on a thursday and they had kareoke great time servers are awesome and so attentive clean but the best part is the food you won t be disappointed i don t drink alcohol but the do have a full bar as well
  man this place is great good service great food beer on tap basically everything you d want at a good bbq joint they have several tvs and lots of seating meals are a little pricy but you do get a good portion size my girlfriend and i have been about a dozen times and we ll keep coming back
  this is a state steet type of bar that is not on state cheap tap beers typical bar food it may be time for an update and some new menu items
  well i certainly wouldn t mind living here unless spearmint flavored ghosts wander the halls after midnight anyway i had a lovely evening here celebrating the birthdays of matthew and shannon and even emily whom i hadn t met the place absolutely targets an older crowd but the indoor lounge space above the bar was comfortable enough for our group and nearly private i m not a huge liquor drinker so i missed out on the five dollar cocktails until 7pm and their wine list was okay but had very few by the glass options the chef s taco of the night was cod and even though it was a frozen battered affair the seasonings really brought it to life the tortillas were a disaster though they were literally pulled straight from the mission flour tortilla bag and not even heated sad oh i snatched a few truffle flavored french fries from christina and thought they were just right mmm french fries wrigley s has a beautiful organic feel to it the way it hugs the hilltop and the views are killer briana was very friendly and it was nice to see the chef come up to say hello too the friday night live music was not my speed but god bless that man for singing his heart out to a practically empty room i think this would be a great place for a private party maybe a rehearsal dinner or business party
  i ve enjoyed harajuku kitchen s food at stockbridge market for a while so was excited to learn that they have recently opened a bistro and was eager to try it inside it s streamline and minimalist with cute and quirky little japanese trinkets around the place a large canvas mural on the back wall and japanese tableware giving it character i loved their menu differing from other japanese restaurants in edinburgh by offering some more exotic and authentic japanese food along with scottish japanese fusion dishes from what i ve read the menu seems to be kept fresh by changing according to season availability of the best produce available drinks such as genmai tea and ramune lemonade worth ordering just for the novelty bottle also offer a nice alternative to the ubiquitous green tea and asahi they do not serve alcohol but do have a byob policy without charge i had the agedashi tofu and assorted sashimi including the catch of the day with wafu salad the first thing i noticed were the portions they are generous and a little more satisfying in comparison to other japanese restaurants in town and are certainly good value the second was the quality of the fish fresh perfectly prepared and complimented by crisp vegetables and a sweet citrus dressing even the notoriously flavour resistant tofu had a tasty smoky flavour and light texture served in a perfectly seasoned dashi broth having eaten previously from their stall at stockbridge market i can also vouch for their appetising gyoza and udon dishes the staff are faultless we were greeted by the incredibly hospitable chef owner kaori and served by a waitress that obviously knew the menu and japanese food in general overhearing a number of other customers asking questions about dishes including customisations which were impressively accommodated without hassle my only criticism would be the lack of seating it s in a great location and has been busy the couple of times i ve passed and will undoubtably grow in popularity i don t want to lose out on a table in the future
  if you enjoy mexican food you will love plaza garibaldi s situated on hanover street plaza garibaldi s is right in the centre of the new town area of edinburgh and is just around the corner from the main shopping street princes street and so it is a convenient place to reach it would be so easy to walk straight past this restaurant as it is absolutely tiny from the outside but it produces the biggest flavours in its meals inside plaza garibaldi s offers a wide range of authentic mexican dishes including tacos enchiladas nachos and dips i have been here several times for my dinner and i absolutely love their sizzling chicken fajita just thinking about them is making my mouth water the chicken is always perfectly cooked and full of flavour and there is platy of guacamole sour cream and cheese to go with it they are so yummy all of their dishes are cooked with really fresh ingredients and they are all full of flavour and pretty spicy plaza garibaldi s make their own corn tortillas which are amazing with the salsa the staff in this restaurant are always incredibly warm and welcoming and are very attentive to the customers the prices are super reasonable here too with most main dishes costing under ten pounds a truly great mexican restaurant which is definitely worth a visit
  a nice central mcdonald s with ample fountain drink dispensers for the visitors be aware of your surroundings here it attracts a few transient people the wifi provided by at t sometimes works just like their cellular reception so no surprise there i m a frequent visitor here to grab drinks work before visiting hotels there are quite a few power plugs for laptops inside of the building
  well i love this place it reminds me of a denny s slash limo in one my favorite is capreses ciabiatta burger vegetarian meal excellent with sweet potatoe fries of course with a dirty martini grey goose 3 olive
  one of the hottest restaurants around is located within eureka casino on east sahara before fat choy chef sheridan su former executive chef at comme ca was serving great bao in the most unlikely place a nail salon i never tried it back then because i have an aversion to the smell dining with salon fumes never seemed appetizing in the least bit i never tracked down the food truck and it s taken me sometime to travel to the eastside but i ve finally done it the eureka casino was nicer than i expected and i had heard interesting characters patronize the casino however on sunday afternoon it was clean quiet and no characters in sight not sure what it says about me but i felt right at home we strolled back to fat choy and took a seat the waitress brought over menus they had a limited selection and no rice or noodle dishes we selected the duck bao 7 and the tofu mushroom bao 6 after she suggested it over the pork belly 7 we also ordered the short rib grilled cheese 10 and the nutella roti 6 for dessert we chose a plain old diet coke and diet dr pepper from their new soda machine with dozens of flavors our bao came out first duck and pork belly were brought out the order was wrong but we stuck with it the buns are steamed to perfection the pork belly was fantastic the fat rendered perfectly so it was rich tender and filled with that wonderful pork flavor i loved the freshness from the cilantro and greens and the texture of the crushed peanuts this was indeed great bao the duck was delicious too the hoisin sauce was light and didn t overwhelm the duck at all now i m curious how the mushroom and tofu bao would be tasty i m sure the short rib grilled cheese comes with provolone and cheddar onion jam and a side of marinara sauce i m a purist when it comes to grilled cheese i d prefer it with only one type of cheese i thought the two cheeses made it a bit greasy the sourdough bread grilled beautifully and the short rib was tender and flavorful with the onion jam the marinara was thick from the tomato paste again not my preference but still all the components make and enjoyable sandwich my husband liked it just fine my tastebuds just didn t concur there was nothing notable about the fries the nutella roti had me intrigued nutella mascarpone honey and walnuts on roti what s not to love the wait as it turns out we waited and waited and waited we would ve cancelled had our waitress been around she conveniently disappeared we waited and waited some more it was ridiculous we asked the other waitress and she said it would be right up we waited and waited finally the pancake topped with goo was brought to the table the pancake was incredibly greasy aside from that the flavors were pretty good but definitely not worth the wait i could be more forgiving if it were busy but we were one of three tables i d hope they weren t that far in the weeds with seven diners our patience wore thin we refused to be held hostage for our bill so my husband went to the counter to take care of it the eats are pretty darn tasty i d return for more bao and i d love to try the duck rice and potstickers i certainly hope service will be improved
  went here because i saw this on diners drive ins and dives and i have to say it was just okay not the best not the worst i think it gets by mostly by reputation and being open all the time tried the calzones the buffalo shrimp on many other dishes and didn t find any to be that remarkable or original worth a one time experience just to say you have gone and that s about it
  a great place to come for reservations the food was delicious and so were the drinks are service just wasn t that great the manager did help out a bit though when we were having issues i wouldn t let it stop me from coming again
  great atmosphere and very friendly staff was not impressed with the chips tasted stale salsa and guacamole this is a must at a mexican restaurant however the burrito and tacos were very delicious
  i don t know what s up with the negative reviews called at 2am for pizza during my stay at the fremont hotel and the guy on the phone was friendly and patient i was ordering delivery off their menu from my phone ordered the medium meat lovers and some onion rings it was 29 and change plus tip and was delivered in about 45 minutes just like the guy had said on the phone food was hot pizza was greasy and delicious i dinged them for soggy onion rings edit a friend mentioned to ask next time for fried foods on to go orders to ask for your to go box to be kept open so the condensation doesn t mess up the food 4 5 after ridiculous amounts of boozing when you cannot summon enough strength to go to a cafe or a mini mart this is a good option
  kung fu on spring mountain china town vegas has consistently offered excellent thai and chinese food fresh and savory and served with courtesy and professionalism each and every time thumbs way up
  ok this is not an ordinary airport restaurant it s not the fastest service but it is one of the best fish tacos and the most incredible green chili and cheese tamales i ve ever had and i ve tried both at many many restaurants after spending 25 years living in houston and traveling throughout the u s but since this restaurant is located in an airport most people enter with a bad attitude to begin with the hassle of traveling long lines rude people but people right next door to each other are two little gems in the phoenix sky harbor headache cartel coffee and sir veza s taco garage great sides also guacamole black beans and spanish rice fish tacos available at breakfast too big plus
  i couldn t resist stopping in again today after my trip to the library it s just a few doors down and this is the kind of place i don t mind going to when i m by myself hope that makes sense i m chalking this up to an isolated meh experience but the food was just off today i still loved the soft tortillas of the street tacos but it was the filling that wasn t quite right today i got what i paid for cheap tasting food maybe i should lower my expectations for el burro just a little and it will seem better again
  so we had only gone for breakfast before we have had two of the happiest lunches recently the meatloaf is down home yum the roasted chicken on fridays is amazing it s shredded in the gravy of the gods and those rolls are fluffy rounds of magic this place really doesn t get any better and for dessert if you can get the lemon or coconut pin raps cake you are in luck
  this food is ridiculously good we just moved into the area and it s by far the best chinese food i ve ever had reasonably priced and incredible customer service highly recommend
  awesome decor great service hidden gem in scottsdale delicious and unique menu the lamb fondue was so great the trout salads and chicken interesting bread basket with an assortment of muffins and breads and a diverse dessert menu they need something a bit more chocolate on it great place one of the best restaurants i have been to in scottsdale
  great atmosphere i love the al fresco eating service left something to be desired but overall i d visit again
  has been nothing but awesome every time i ve been here and i ve been going since 2008
  four words better than union grill
  how many times do i have to say my order how many times do i have to say my order again three stars because the food is good but the order line has a bunch of confusion calling out orders and food you can hear frustration amongst the staff taking orders there is no organization whatsoever the girl skipped my chicken all together and i had to ask twice about it management needs to restructure this system
  not that oregano s really needs yet another glowing review but here it is yum
  had a groupon for this place so decided to give it a try pros i really like the idea of having so many options honestly your dining experience is solely at your discretion the toppings you choose make it so i love the fries they are homemade which i like a lot the atmosphere is a lot of fun retro 50 s diner trivial pursuit cards at the table while you wait fun cons pricey for a burger joint i think the prices are a bit steep and although the burgers weren t bad i wouldn t say they were great either i have had better all in all not a bad place to check out occasionally
  eat here at least once or twice each time we re in town individually cajun dishes made in front of you in small stainless gas fired kettles get here early especially on weekends also have raw oysters crab and shrimp cocktails oyster shooters and a great bar selection
  the steak here is only 8 99
  delicious pizza and even better garlic knots delivered hot and fresh to my office which was nice and convenient i ll definitely be eating here more often and wish i d found this place sooner
  i have been all over and had plenty of italian food i looked around my hotel for something good to eat i saw a picture of a little fat man that is pretty much the symbol of italian food i was expecting a pizzaria or some kind of mom and pop shop giorgio is defiantly not either of those i suddenly realized that i was under dressed in my t shirt and jeans still the server showed me to my seat and was very quick to realize french was not my first language and offered me an english menu i always feel bad coming to another country and not being able to speak the language still the waiter made me feel at home trying his best to explain the things i didn t understand i was expecting the olive garden style of food and service it was slightly busy so i expected my order to take a little while but then something strange happened i got my food before my drink and not in a bad way about 5 minutes after ordering my drink and food i had my food and a minute later my drink not only was the pasta fast it was fantastic the portions were very nice sized and i left happy while a little on the pricy side for my usual taste this place is worth every penny
  great for lunch or dinner everything is really fresh here and the service is great i ve never had a dish here that i didn t love all the food is just so well made and presented and it s so delicious they also have decent vegetarian options the service is also very very good the wait staff is friendly and basically will cater to what ever you ask one time they we re out of an appetizer i wanted to order so they gave me another one for free it would be a great place to go on a date if you re going there for lunch and want a quick good bite order the meatball sandwich or the chicken parm sandwich oh my god they re both freaking amazing
  first day ever in vegas we ended up here since it was the only late night place open serving sushi vanessa g took over our ordering upon our request great sushi and sake recommendations we left with a bottle of sake to finish up in the room
  after one meal at the smiling banana leaf i was pretty certain i was hooked a second visit recently sealed the deal every thai meal in pittsburgh will have to live up to the high standard set by the smiling banana we had the panang curry and basil curry and on our second visit the crispy duck soup and noodles along with red curry everything was delicious and the service on both visits was attentive and nice without being overly intrusive which is hard for a restaurant with a tiny dining room now that i ve mentioned the tiny dining room i can be honest my biggest fear is not will i have a good meal it s will there be a wait i m hungry so far so good but just for the record it s food totally worth waiting for
  this was the saltiest food i ve ever had the location was trendy but couldn t save it from the horrible food this is a must miss taco bell is more authentic
  it s not mexican its tex mex so as long as you realize that you re going to be ok the salsa is awesome the service is awesome and most of the food is awesome we drive from the other side of town to go to this place i have not had anything here i didn t like and most of the servers have all been great drinks are great too if you re looking for drinks they just redid the patio and it is super nice
  when i think of montreal portuguese cuisine is not the first thought that comes to my mind smoked meat and poutine may be the dishes that montreal may be best known for but you can add portuguese roast chicken to that list at rotisserie romados their portuguese roast chicken is right up there with some of the best grilled chicken that i have eaten how good was the chicken this was by far the best meal of my trip located in the plateau neighborhood rotisserie romados is about an 8 10 minute walk from the mont royal metro station upon first glance i honestly thought that the outside facade of the eatery reminded me of a church that being said this church of chicken is a fairly small eatery with a few seats if you choose to eat in but primarily a place to order take out besides the roast chicken rotisserie romados also has a bakery that serves up a pretty respectable selection of mouth watering portuguese pastries as far as the food is concerned let s just say that something is seriously wrong with you if you leave here hungry eager to feast on some chicken that i had heard so much about i ordered the 1 2 chicken plate that came with a salad and was covered with a mountain of fries at only 8 cad this was such a great deal especially with the portions being so generous grilled over charcoal the roast chicken was extremely moist on the inside but still retained a crispy crunch on the outside although the chicken was probably tasty enough as is i decided to have my chicken slathered with a spicy piri piri sauce to get the full portuguese chicken experience since i had come all the way from hawaii the spices from the piri piri sauce and the drippings from the chicken were the perfect sauce to dip my fries in to scoop up all that yummy flavor if this were not good enough the lady at the register also added in a free dessert to my lunch this would be more than enough for most people but i always have room for dessert i do not speak any french or portuguese but i made sure to remember the words pastel de nata this portuguese custard tart was the perfect end to my chicken feast and just blew my mind by how creamy delicious it was just writing this review makes my mouth water and brings back fond memories of my trip to montreal
  this is what my mom and i like to call the budget buffet cheap to chow and the food is relatively tasty the food isn t of the same quality as let s say the buffet at the mgm but the price is about half the food here isn t as bland and tasteless as many other buffets either i would eat here before eating at rio again i am giving it 3 stars for the food and selection plus a bonus star for the price
  i ve been coming here for a long time love the beer always have always been very happy with the food the last few times the good has not been as good tonight my girlfriend and i came in for dinner i ordered a staple on the menu knowing that i ve eaten it at least 3 4 other times unfortunately this time again i was dissatisfied with the food the manager shawn came out to my table he explained that they have had some issues with kitchen staff and food prep he was absolutely awesome he made sure my order was taken off of our bill and he made a few suggestions about things he thought i may like we settled on something new and he also said that he was going to take care of that on our bill as well i m very very happy with the way that my complaint was handled i will continue to come here knowing that if i m not happy with my order they will do everything possible to make sure that i m happy with my overall experience thanks again
  what do you get when you mix a college frat party with the meyer s park crowd you get a bunch of drunk guys with shaggy hair and blue blazers pounding beers and hitting on girls while the bartenders roll their eyes that was pretty much the crowd at selwyn on saturday night i ve gotta give this place props for their outdoor space it s fantastic huge with lots of heaters so you will have no problem staying warm while sitting outside in the winter they also have a bunch of fire pits in case you have a group that just wants to hang out the bartenders just don t seem like they want to be there so the service was a bit slow for a place that at the time i was getting another round wasn t even packed so here are a few reasons you want to check this place out 1 it s the end of the night and you re looking to meet someone 2 it s early in the night and you want to go somewhere that isn t crowded yet 3 you want to relive your college frat years with the guys 4 you re trying to find a place that can comfortably seat 10 15 people in one place 5 you like cold beer 6 you love a good outdoor space
  when i first started going here the food was delicious but i noticed they got new people and the food hasn t been that great the food is a little pricey and the wait time can be a little long
  i used to live in napa and was very excited there was a bouchon here in vegas not only is the cuisine excellent but i love the atmosphere and ambiance of both the napa and vegas restaurant bouchon has a bit of everything and i always love trying new items every visit they have a great kids menu as well so don t be intimated rillettes aux deux saumons was an item that seemed odd to me but really delicious when i tried it i m a huge fan of their confit de canard which sells out fast also love their perfectly roasted poulet roti the croque madame and sole billi bi brunch reservations go fast on weekends but sooo perfectly portioned and i love their selections and accompaniments the raw bar has an incredible selection of freshly flown in sea food the desserts are a perfect way to end a good meal i love the bouchons mmm it s an experience that always takes me to a place of relaxation and indulgence
  my bff and i were walking in christown spectrum mall last night when we came upon wingstop leaning over the bar that separates the mall from the restaurant we decided that one day we d return for beer and wings but mostly for the beer and to people watch because that s what one does at cs mall after parting ways i decided to give wingstop a shot and was pleasantly surprised the restaurant was nearly empty when i walked in at 8 there was a young couple with their baby cart on a counter and a lady with a wal mart shopping cart with her purchases including a case of beer wingstop doesn t have a huge menu but they have the basics for survival wings fries beer with nine sauces from which to chose atomic cajun original hot mild hickory smoked bbq lemon pepper garlic parmesan hawaiian and teriyaki there s a great variety of options i sampled the atomic and instantly knew that my mouth and stomach would hate me if i selected that sauce instead i ordered a 10 piece boneless combo and pacifico i was given the option of two sauces original hot and garlic parm in this case and a dip blue cheese after being informed it would take about nine minutes i took a seat to take in the scene first i have to say the customer service was incredible it s truly appreciated when young people exhibit even mediocre customer service skills and the crew here were solid as for the food the wings were very good the original hot are your basic wing sauce nothing too fancy the garlic parm was great with a generous sprinkling of parmesan cheese the fries as the website state are fresh cut and you can tell they re not processed in the normal fashion of fries which is a good thing you can even request more of your sauce or another from the list in which to dip your fries or wings sweet the only complaint i have is the paper towels are only one roll located at the front counter i guess i can understand keeping costs down by limiting the amount of waste that could happen but wings can get messy tuesday nights they have a 2 beer special all beer is only 2 by the time i left the front dining area had filled up a bit more an encouraging sign if you find yourself in the cs mall area stop on by entrances are from the parking lot and the mall
  first time in vegas my friend invited me to eat peruvians food i was a little skeptical about the flavor since i m bored peruvian raise in miami once we got there the warm reception at the door the quick assistance with the table it got me into then there is nothing fancy but exquisite dishes i can say that my short time in that restaurant was unique if i return to vegas i would down to go to to lima limon again i highly recommend this place
  free wifi this place is right across the street from the waterloo hotel and it s one of the 2 places that accepts breakfast voucher from the hotel the distance and the free wifi made it perfect for travelers who wants breakfast but doesn t want to venture out especially in the winter the coffee is very average and food is what you d expect from a coffee bar nothing too impressive for locals it s a good place to do some work not super crowded or loud if you come here for the coffee though you might be disappointed
  love thai food and this is the good stuff friendly staff huge menu our party of 11 adults all had different items and all received high marks the google pin on the map is slightly off and will mislead you this place is in a small shopping center right across from the main parking lot of lowes across the street fantastic all around
  food was refreshing i had the pepperoni pizza and my wife had the chinese chicken salad both were fresh and tasty interesting thing i noticed the male servers had cloth sleeves covering their tattoos but the female hostess was in not much more than a bikini and she did not have to cover the tattoo from her lower back wrapping around to her ribs i am just saying its vegas and i believe in equal opportunity both for women and men
  you have to get the full tacos or governor the horchata was just ok the yelp deal will get you a free large drink the salsa bar has some tasty choices avocado sauce chipotle pico de gallo limes and other choices as well
  tonight was the 3rd night naya has been open 1 service was excellent amanda did a super job 2 menu contained many compelling entrees a wife had lamb chops loved them b i had jenne s penne omg the best 3 portions very generous 4 priced more than right 5 drinks were right as too volume my wife and i eat out very often we think we have a feel for what a nice meal should cost after our meal we both thought of what would be a good value would be for our 4 drinks 2 appetizers 2 entrees one desert one soft drink we agreed that 135 00 is about what the meal should have cost not counting tip the bill arrived and it was 98 00 not counting tip and we were very pleasantly surprised will we go back not until next week naya will be a success larry ps our server apologized for taking a few minutes too long to get our drinks she told us upfront that this was the crew s third night of being open and things might take a bit longer she told us this before the fact and before we got antsy her telling us upfront saved us the aggravation of wondering wtf
  this review applies to all locations this sub shop franchise should be sued for false advertising i had to buy a few lunches at their galleria location and this is my experience 1 the home cooked bread is not even close to resembling or tasting of french bread or like italian either wonder bread and mayo is what it tastes like totally unacceptable in 2012 when you can buy a semi decent french baguette in any supermarket 2 no can toast the bread sorry really 3 there s nothing remotely gourmet about any of their ingredients cold cuts cheeses salads nothing 4 false cheers are simply annoying just a few blocks north on monroe is the southern gourmet cafe now the sandwiches cost twice as much and the service is sloooooooow but the food is a gourmet treat
  have been coming here for the last couple years and in the last year the quality of the food has gone downhill the quality of meat is not to standard as it used to be very fatty and tough some of the cuts were so raw that couldn t be consumed when the prices go up and quality goes down its time to find a new restaurant after giving this place another chance im done wont be going back
  went here for lunch with rand h and this place is big for a chinese buffet it is in the shell of an old sizzler the food here is pretty good i do not think i tried anything that was not at least average with most dishes above average they had a couple of different items as well mexican chicken wings that tasted like they were cooked with oranges and shrimp balls that were pretty good so yes i would go back even though it is not one of my favorite chinese buffet but it is a good one
  terrible experience allergy to onions repeated that and my burger still had onions not to mention my burger was burnt and our appetizer came out at same time as the meal will not be back and dojt recommend
  yet again triple d doesn t disappoint this place is great the atmosphere is contagious and the food was great i will be back and i m bringing friends
  wow this food is really flavorful this is a really cool space inside the saguaro hotel great kitschy cool decor friendly hip service and delicious food the shrimp and chorizo tacos were fantastic and the pork carnitas tacos were very good too the creamy rice with corn and the corn side are both out of this world yummy
  great sushi place in montreal i tried their tasting menu and really love it highly recommended
  casual michael mina little bit pf chang in some moments went for a work function so can t complain and everything was tasty if a bit salty large portions it is vegas after all
  good pizza bad attitude this is vegas if your in a bad mood to be working the register go home if i wanted to deal with someone acting like they are doing me a favor than i would of stayed home remember people come to vegas to get away from reality its ok to fake a smile register girl we all do it in the real world
  tino and ashley are great lucky to have such a cool place close to home try the gilroy pizza unreal if you play video poker they take care of you
  i ve been here a couple of times for breakfast and have found the food to be just ok however i do appreciate that they utilize local farmers and produce for their meals the place is pretty popular so expect a wait if you arrive after 9 00 a m on the weekends they do offer coffee while you wait but i m just not a big fan of their coffee on my last visit which was in oct 2013 i ordered the blazing saddles omelet with biscuit and sweet potato hash browns the biscuit was pretty dry and the sweet potatoes were a handful of cubed sweet potatoes the omelet was a good size and was the best tasting part of the meal i m willing to try other things on the menu but don t have high hopes there are many other options for a solidly good breakfast in charlotte i wouldn t put this place on the list
  lyrics celine dion r kelly i m your angel no sake too dry for you to try all you have to do is have an appetite oh yeah no valley too far for you to make it across all you have to do is review it when you stay and then you will see the noodles they serve and every dish will be tasty as they come serve me some pho cast them on me i just want you to eat i ll have your eggrolls in a fly i ll have your pad thai just to try i ll try your tartare when you make it at angelina s angelina s is probably one of the best americanize modern vietnamese fusion restaurant i ve experienced in the phoenix valley i generally don t venture around on the westside much so i had to yelp around for a restaurant and found this little gem the decors are definitely asian inspired and is a mix of all the major asian cultures japanese chinese vietnamese korean etc a full bar with sake sochu and draft beer was apparent totally dig the imports i sat at the bar stool since i was solo i had fun just reading the menu to see all fusion mix but settled for the beef tartare and the snow crab udon noodle soup the chef came out to great me asking my nationality as first i was confused but later he explained that most vietnamese guest that come in expect a certain type of tartare but his culinary education was french inspired so it was different i told him i don t have a preference and i only appreciate good food the tartare was served like a raw hamburger patty with some shrimp chips and some well seasoned roasted mushrooms the capers atop provided a sour pungent bite as i spread the tartare on top of the chips which of course gave it a crunchy texture to every piece i ate overall i enjoyed it very much the snow crab udon noodle was next and this for me was another exploration dish the broth was extra thick like egg drop soup the beef was well infused in the broth giving it that extra flavorful taste while the udon noodles was slippery and slurpee making it a perfect noodle meal the chef came out with some house made hot sauce which added to make dish giving it a spicy punch i only added a little since i enjoy spicy but not too much and boy was that sauce spicy overall service was great and food was tops the chef and staff provided me with extra attention maybe because i looked vietnamese and i m sure they were wondering what i would think i m not picky nor would i ever complain about hey this ain t like mom s cooking cause in the end it isn t mom s cooking and it will never be but expect to venture out of your comfort zone and be open minded enjoy
  looking to surprise spouse while in phoenix with good german of course the rouladen was not as good as her mom s but then again i am sure there never will be one that competes with mom s other than competing with mom s the food and service were excellent the rouladen though not mom s was thoroughly enjoyed the brats german potatoes sauerbraten and spatzel were delicious desserts wow got to try the sauerkraut cake it s a chocolate lover s delight
  i wish i could find another place that made a dan dan noodle bowl besides pf changs until then pei wei will just have to do extra sauce and bean sprouts please
  make your own scramble my personal favorite is pepper jack cheese chorizo pepper and onion their pancakes are delicious my boyfriend got the cajun biscuits and gravy and absolutely loved them i think when i looked away he started licking the plate their cocktails are different but nonetheless good i didn t love the bloody mary it is made with beets and the stick of food on top isn t great either the pumpkin cider beer was really good and so are all the cocktails i ve tried except the bloody mary overall short stack eateries food is definitely worth it and they are open late on weekends they can get pretty busy but you pay before hand then have food delivered like noodles and company i definitely recommend this place for brunch
  this is by far the worst food i have ever had in my existence the chicken tastes like boiled meat and is absolutely disgusting we ordered several items to bring back to a family party i was so embarrassed by what i served i had to apologize to everyone for the horrible dinner and we ended up ordering pizza do not waste your money on this nasty food
  we had been to tien wong hotpot in chandler t spot about ten times and had high hopes for shabu fondue it delivered and then some the portion sizes tripled and the quality was identical as the old location my only complaint was that it was uncomfortably hot in there needed to be 5 10degrees cooler to offset all the steaming hot pots this place remains awesome
  first time eating here after driving by it many times since it opened and have to say i was impressed we had the coconut shrimp appetizer filet kabobs with grilled veggies and au gratin potatoes and prime rib with loaded baked potato service was also good so we will be coming back
  it s definitely pricey but if you go hungry you will absolutely get your money s worth the dining room is large so you won t have to wait forever for seating and the selection is incredible the dessert buffet along is phenomenal i loved that so many of the items came in small portions pre measured into cups bowls etc so you just grab one and go don t worry when you decide that you love the pasta dish or gelato you can easily go grab another serving i was so satisfied with their selection and quality this is a must try brunch stop
  i don t know why i never reviewed this place sooner but this is the home of some of the best burgers i have ever had period i went there with the bf for lunch so it wasn t too busy and we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a booth i liked the fact that each booth had it s own tv cute the service was fine as well i don t recall waiting forever or having an issue at all maybe it s just the luck of the draw in any case screw the service focus on the burgers i love hubert keller so i was definitely expecting something amazing i ordered the 3 sliders which were simply divine i still have flashbacks to eating the one with cheese and caramelized onions if i could only have one last burger before i died that would be the one there were some more expensive burgers on the menu that i had been tempted to try but since i hadn t ever been there before i chose to be a bit frugal until i figured out if i approved of the burgers boy do i approve when i head back there though i think i ll have to try something with truffles my fav
  ohhhh lalalala yardhouse is the best place to be theeee best spot for a happy hour they served all my favorite dish my husband i enjoy coming to this place atmosphere is great
  i can t think of another place that is like i heart cafe when this was originally berits brown i only ever visited once mainly to quickly leave again after i saw the price they were charging for a sandwich so when this re opened as an independent shop many month ago i was very excited to see the same great food but much reduced prices it s not just the price that makes me love this place though it s the food it s high quality and they make everything fresh when you order it they have a great selection of proper sandwiches the kind that i miss so much from the states these are sandwiches made with nice thick slices of fresh bread filled with lots of fresh ingredients my favourite sandwich is their classic chicken with tender roasted chicken fresh tomato and rocket and basil mayo just yum the cafe also offers a nice array of salads the very best of these is an amazing couscous salad they ve had during the last two visits i made it s a heavenly combination of giant israeli couscous tangy green apples dried cranberries fresh parsley and another ingredient or two that i can t quite guess but wish i could so i could recreate this at home i might need to ask for the recipe next time i m in in addition to sandwiches and salads they have a daily list of specials and soup and also some scrumptious looking cakes and tray bakes they also do take away at a discount to the menu price which means that i can grab a quick dinner on my way home from late night shopping i really can t say enough about how great this place is i just wish edinburgh had more places like it
  my husband ate a burger here on saturday evening november 16 2013 and subsequently became sick with gastroenteritis a few hours later we are wondering if anyone else has had this experience around this date and time please be careful what you eat and please if you work somewhere handling food wash your hands regularly
  this visit was great service my first visit to any smashburger everyone was friendly the burger was really good someone from staff asked how i was doing 3 times during my 25 min visit not only did they ask if i needed anything it seemed sincere not the cheapest burger but did i mention the burger was great i will be back
  planned a little day trip and drive to florence arizona and knew i had to stop here for lunch hadn t been here in about four years but seemed to have remembered liking this place and my memory was correct the beer was good and cold had a couple of shock top drafts the wait staff and bartenders were cheerful and talkative the atmosphere was as i remembered it kinda biker dive barish ordered the road king burger and steak fries burger was good not great three napkins and would have like it a little less done more toward medium and the steak fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside just the way i like them i will definitely be back even if i have to plan a day trip again
  so i am kind of bias because i have been eating here for ten plus years but if you want good to above average food at reasonable prices without the scuminess that comes with practically ever pub in town this is the place i love that it is tucked away in the lakes like some secret because it is the average person would pass by a hundred times and never know it was there my dad took me here one day randomly as he had been eating there for many years with his friends after golf and it is now the place i take anyone from out of town or new friends my favorite meal is probably a common one the steak sandwich
  great happy hour specials i love the frozen margaritas they were perfect and their sushi was delish
  girlfriends favorite place i started eating in here a few years ago after servicing their fire equipment for work 4 years later its still my girlfriends and i s favorite place to go grab some italian shawn
  enjoyed a decent panino here for a late breakfast the other week the coffee was good too aim to get one of the tables that looks south along queensferry street as they afford the best people watching options
  some have knocked the service here but on our visit the staff bent over backwards for us they were attentive but not overbearing the food was good we had the tom sum papaya salad and it was plentiful and tasty not as spicy as i have had at other places but flavorful the panang duck was tasty as well nice thing about duck is it is fattier than chicken so can take some overcooking and i think mine was a bit over it was complimented by plentiful broccoli carrots and snow peas the sauce had a good level of heat for me which is to say spicy but not too spicy i asked for 2 on their 4 star heat scale the prices are a bit higher than i find in winston salem but the restaurant is between the carolina medical center and uncc so i would expect to pay more and the portions are generous i would definitely go back if i find myself in the area again
  i was spending time with some girlfriends on a saturday and suddenly we all realized that we were starving i googled sun prairie restaurants and this place came up the menu looked fine and it was close so we headed over we went in the wrong door after parking in the first legal spot we found we entered the door that had an awning and and open sign it was a bar door and it seemed to surprise the people in the bar who all looked at us with something like shock we couldn t find any sort of host station or even a bartender so we just kept walking in to the restaurant eventually we found a nervous young man who told us to sit anywhere we almost sat in a broken booth a little warning sign goes a long way but were warned off by a nearby customer the place is very run down inside broken booth broken speakers not all the lights on but the food was fine and the prices were great i had the indian taco navajo fry bread with taco toppings on top and my friends had tacos and the southwest burger we all loved our food and the server the same nervous young man from before was attentive
  went to rollin smoke a couple of days ago finally i find a bbq place in vegas that i can eat at this place is great but i did take off a star for no table service they just bring out your order now back to the important part the bbq outstanding covers it quite well i got the trio the brisket the thinner slices were juicy and smoky the one thick slice was a little tough and dryer not sure why ribs were meaty and good with the bbq sauce applied which was a little thin for my taste but flavorful the sauce brought out more flavor but flavor dropped off alot with no sauce but still good though and finally the hot link i think wow covers it a lot of flavor right amount of heat and perfect snap as for the sides beans were great potato salad just ok could have cooked potatoes a few minutes longer were just under crunchy but flavor was good overall absolutely will go back but famous daves ribs are still better not sure why will have to try both again and report back
  it had been a while since eating at el bravo and i am glad to put it back in my good places to eat list great food go check it out oh and they make their tortillas in house yumm
  okay i don t mind country music but when did applebee s turn into a country bar the music was loud and took away from what you want good conversation you have to speak up just to be heard hey manager of this applebee s do you read these reviews yes it did takes long time for even drinks to be ordered
  i was a little bit skeptical when i first came to noodles it seems strange to me that a very good authentic szechuan noodles restaurant could be in the middle of a las vegas hotel i was surprised at the quality of the food the shumai was tasty i ordered the dan dan noodles and they were very good with very tender beef brisket my daughter were the chicken chow mein which was surprisingly tasty not overly greasy in a sea of buffets and all you can eat this restaurant got four stars
  this is a local spot that my husband and i like to get take out from pretty often we love it i usually order the chicken kabob plate and my husband usually orders the combination plate and they are always delicious the rice is my favorite great local greek food and friendly staff
  i can see how this would be an amazing place to go to before a pirates or steelers game beautiful location for that plenty of beers on tap big area and a clean bar i had the turducken burger and it was really unique actually was pretty stoked on it i also had the wings with hot sauce and i was disappointed the sauce had no kick to it and they were bland but all in all it s not a bad place to go get some grub if i lived here it would be one of the spots i d hit up before a game just because of the location and the ambience
  excellent craft beer list and hot fresh food didn t get to experience live music but but the look of it the size of the place probably leads to really loud music would definitely go back for the food
  for vacations i love to browse yelp to look fro great places to eat in the city i visit so for this past winter break i went to vegas with friends and family before we left las vegas i wanted to try out babycakes since it seemed pretty popular on yelp and one of their specialties was red velvet pancakes mind you i love red velvet cake cupcakes yogurt so this was a must try my friends and i came at the right time and we didn t have to wait long this was probably around 8 45 friday morning new year s eve the server was wonderful and friendly i of course ordered red velvet pancakes with cream cheese syrup and a cup of coffee it was soft and fluffy like a flattened red velvet cake i truly enjoyed the pancakes and so did my boyfriend we shared a full stack i would definitely have to stop by here again whenever i come back to vegas
  this place rocks the food is absolutely delicious the hummus is amazing and only fresh ingredients are used we try to go there weekly as it is that good
  the largest turn off about this place was the service we were stoked on a brewing co however after waiting 20 minutes we actually had to go up and ask for help it s really small we had the ipa the beer was great but unfiltered i ordered chicken tenders they were burnt but other than that they would prob be good my boyfriend got the philly cheesesteak he wasn t impressed my aunt got the filet mignon sliders and loved it
  this restaurant is so amazing especially if you like quick yummy flavorful food it is perfect for students and staff at unlv the location is super close to campus and the prices can t be beat the restaurant is also great for pescatarians as most of the offerings are delicious fish i recommend the po boy sandwiches fried clams and the cole slaw yum yum
  i love this creperie in old montreal i sat facing the window that opened up to the street so everything taste better you know had savoury crepe with melted brie cheese sauteed onions and believe chicken the half melted brie did it all it was so good the cafe au lait i ordered was only mediocre though for 3 50 or sth i expect better cup of coffee but it s ok the crepe was so good i was pretty full to try any dessert crepe but for sure i d love to come back
  went here looking for a pint they had only a few drinks on tap but they were all good try the blonde very full flavor the bartenders were very friendly my group was from out of town and it was obvious got several free drinks from other patrons and we returned the favor we didn t try the food but definitely stop by and sit at the small bad to interact with the locals
  fabulous that s all i can say even for the one time i ve been to this restaurant my sister insisted i go knowing i m a fan of bbq for the baby back rib special on fridays i was not disappointed the ribs were perfectly fall off the bone tender the sauce was sweet with a little heat the kicker was the shrimp and grits i entered not knowing what kind of restaurant it was but when i learned about the all day breakfast i was torn between the ribs and shrimp and grits my loving wife ordered the latter and gave me a taste they were fantastic savory tender shrimp ham just a flavor bonanza i cannot over recommend this place definitely going here next time i m back in charlotte
  i went with some friends and made the mistake of ordering french toast the bottom was not cooked and tasted like raw egg i asked for it to be replaced with waffles which turned out to be a bit floppy and not very tasty i tried my wife s chicken and it was okay i don t know why i would go back
  its a typical wine bar and dinning place they have some good food but it is hit and miss on the quality of it i have been a few times and each time the food tastes a little different the meat balls are pretty good if cooked right and the mac and cheese is pretty good as well the inside is nice to just hang out if you want on some couches or there is a nice patio outside but a little small for the amount of people they try to fit in can get kinda loud if its a nice night and there are a lot of people wine wise it is a wine bar so they have a lot of wine and the staff has good knowledge as they should have good pours and good quality wine i would go back for some wine on the happy hour but beyond that it will be a hit and miss place good note they do have a yelp coupon so make sure to check in when you visit
  i ve been here several times and the sushi is so so good it s one of my favorite places to go unfortunately the ice tea needs a little work it s never good here i always just order a beer instead but there s days where i wish i could order tea and be happy
  outstanding i wish i had more time to write reviews of all the places i go but i just wanted to share a quick review in a nutshell definitely a go to place yes the area is kind of shady and its in a seedy little strip mall but come on if you are an adult then get over it food was great service wonderful and accomodating only negative was there isn t a bar you can sit at while waiting for your table we sat outside at the little table on the sidewalk and had a drink the owner told us that the crowd in the rest of the little stip mall wasn t the classiest it was totally fine i never saw the bill so i can t say for sure what the pricing was i am pretty sure it should be 2 signs some reviews say byob but those reviews are very old and i think before the current owner you do not need to byob w
  ah z 1 for the cheap lunch specials 1 for the friendly service and the cute guy at the register with long ish hair 1 for being open past 6pm in downtown phoenix pizza isn t amazing but it s not meant to be the salads are pretty delicious from 2 5 the slices are only 1 plus they deliver within a 2 mile radius and don t charge if you order enough times like me apparently you get a free large pizza oh yeah there is alcohol
  umami burger definitely has a great deal of potential but it s not anyway good enough to currently compete in the las vegas market first of all having a waitress who didn t know what a manhattan cocktail was is a bad sign that they are hiring the worst of the worst to work there i ordered the hatch burger and from the start when it came out i was underwhelmed the food looks a lot better in the photos and frankly the preparation of chopping the chills up with the seeds still in them shows they aren t aware of how to properly prepare a hatch pepper the burger was cold and nothing about it was remotely hot the meet had clearly been sitting out by itself and then the toppings added to make the burger my client who enjoyed eating there the previous night also complained about the same thing clearly the service is not up to par or consistent probably will not go back there again
  i watched the cook drop a hot dog on the floor and put it in the bun and seved it to the customer verry unsanitary place
  have had trouble finding good sushi in the area so i was really happy to find this place i will definitely be going back it s a little expensive for dinner but they do have a good happy hour and you get what you pay for
  i love this place and have been numerous times with that said we stopped in on a tuesday about 8 45 website said they were open till 10pm sign on door says 9 00 we were greeted by the server on duty we asked if there was still time to eat she said we close in 15 minutes grabbed some menus and was going to seat us we asked if we could sit outside she said no no explanation just found out online there is a permit issue with the city when we couldnt sit outside without explanation we decided we would not stay the serve plopped down the menus and said okay bye we are locals and we love going here for lunch and dinner enough to even recommend it friends living here and visiting guests to the city the lady server on duty isn t doing the company any favors by making people feel unwelcome i will give it another try and hope the friendliness factor goes up we need places like bar bistro but hopefully they realize they need customers too
  not an authentic chinese cuisine but still good the fried rice wasnt the best overall experience was good hot and sour soup was yummy and the crab puffs too
  only had 2 things here 3 seperate times the prices here are pretty outrageous for italian food which is easily some of the cheapest food ever to make that aside seafood salad is incredible next lemon chicken very good the sauce is like pure lemon vinegar and really addicting and makes up for the chicken being slightly dry i can make way better chicken on mesquite wood in my backyard but their lemon sauce is great seafood salad you can order half order even if the waiter or waitress tries to jam you for the full portion i have done it 3x and both the 2nd and 3rd time they tried to tell me i have worked her xxxx years and we have never made half of one again bs also half of one is great portion definitely great 2 items the rest of the menu is a major reamer so i will not even mess with it
  amazing staff prompt service and great food all of the staff is incredibly nice here and gives unbridled service to all gusts
  authentic food friendly service and the best mariscos must try and bring some friends their margaritas and micheladas are great
  i had dinner with my mom here on a friday night around 5 30 and we were seated right away no wait service was great very friendly knew the menu and we never waited long for anything first they bring you a warm loaf of bread with butter crusty and soft just like bread should be we started with the warm goat cheese in marinara with pesto garlic bread it was delicious and so hard to stop eating it was a large serving for two for our mains i had the vegetable farcis five stuffed veggies on a bed of quinoa and tomato it was good not amazing egg plant was over cooked and the rest of the stuffed veggies were 1 maybe 2 bites for a side we shared some garlic spinach which was good my mom had the trout it had great flavor and she was very happy with what she had lastly we shared the profiteroles a pastry filled with vanilla ice cream and covered with a hot fug sauce i dont think you can go wrong with that they were yummy i would go again and sit out side and enjoy the views people watching and some good food
  their portions are really good and the food has never disappointed me i prefer going to this place and getting quality sushi instead of the ayce places around this town
  just as delicious as it was five years ago jessica was our waitress and took excellent care of us we split the hog heaven and almost finished it the brisket melts in your mouth and the doughnuts no matter how full i am they are a sweet finale
  this place is really delicious and is the perfect place for a quick lunch or a random snack the salmon sandwich is flavorful and cooked perfectly the iced tea is brewed to perfection and the chips are crunchy salty and delicious i went here after i got to the hotel and was waiting for my room to be ready we checked in early it didn t disappoint
  a really nice place to come and get good sushi i ve never sat in the main dining room but the bar area is perfectly nice for a quick meal the cocktails are fantastic and the food is awesome as well the sushi list has a lot of variety and the parmesan fries are one of my favorites to start i d recommend upstream to everyone
  the food here tastes like food you could get at fridays or chilis or any american chain restaurant but for double the price i got the crabcake sandwich or burger or something and thought it was kind of dry and over cooked the buffalo wings were delicious but you really can t go wrong with it since it just tastes like buffalo sauce i ordered the almond frozen hot chocolate to go but the waiter brought it to me in the bowl thing while it was admittedly beautiful served as it was you realize that it only fills up like 3 4 of a tall starbucks cup when they transfer it and take off the huge amount of whipped cream for 11 dollars what it was good but sososososo sweet but good if you have the sweetest tooth of life me anyway the food was solid enough and still remains one of the more affordable dine in restaurants on the strip i cry saying that since i was crying at the check cries
  cashier was annoyed when i asked if they had gluten free options he told me they don t so we left
  edo japanese restaurant on monona drive is such an awesome place their sushi is amazing every single time we go there one of our favorite things is the kani salad yum their hibachi dinners are great too and entertaining with fire and juggling their chefs and waitstaff are always super friendly they have some great lunch specials too for a good price i highly recommend this place
  awesome food standard delivery time free delivery and they totally hit the spot for late night munchies 3
  my philly cheese steak was killer the bread was so soft but my boyfriends pepperoni slices were mediocre the price is right at this place
  love this place oolong sea bass mongolian beef is to die for we had the best service from nicholas
  went in on labor day 2011 at around 1 30pm with my fiance was told the kitchen was backed up two hours what the hell is up with that who the hell do they have back there preparing the dishes that is a bunch a crap if they can t handle being busy then they need to get outa the kitchen will never go back there very disapointed
  the gyro was amazing and the lentil soup was delicious this is a friendly family owned place that obviously cares about their food and their customers we will definitely be returning
  i was in there today at lunchtime and ordered the following ranch wrap grilled chicken fries soda whoever rolled this thing doesn t know what the hell they were doing are you the only person at this location who hasn t rolled a joint i know most of you are only working there so the welfare ppl don t take your bennies away but at least pretend like you give a damn about what you do the wrap fell apart as soon as i opened the container i did not go to the mgr as i was in a hurry suffice it to say i will not patronize this mcdonalds ever again this review is also going to mcdonalds corporate website
  i m a little late to the kaba curry game they have a very casual vibe here clean setup nice atmosphere and the friendly staff goes well with the good food served here my fav so far has been the curry rice 11 tonkatsu kaarage and fried egg i asked for the spicy curry and it packs a punch it was only a little bit spicy in my book but there was tons of flavor my favorite japanese curry so far i would say the tonkatsu was passable though as well as the kaarage i think the best sides so far have been the chicken katsu and kurobuta sausage personally also tried the curry cheese fries 12 13 chicken katsu kurobuta sausage corn and mushrooms this was much different but tasty recommended if you want to try something new in a less traditional sense we have also tried the curry udon which is essentially udon noodles with a curry broth it is thin enough to drink as a soup without being overpowering the flavor is good but the combination was a little different give it a try if you are looking for something different and to finish we got to try the pumpkin kaba cakes these were pretty awesome they steam the cakes here so they come out super moist rich and delicious this was the highlight of the meal along with the flavorful curry check it out if you are craving curry pics
  been in this plaza and ate at two other restaurants there i m surprised it took me this long to find ichiza the food here is sooo delicious it was a little annoying to find consistent information about when they are open their website on the home page and the contact page and yelp have different times listed their door says 5pm 2 30am with the last call at 2 30am i guess this means they don t have happy hour anymore i went with one other person we sat at the bar it s an open kitchen so we can see what the chefs are doing the whole time we ordered and shared beef tongue skewers chicken yakitori skewers crab meat fried rice yellowtail tartar tuna tartar salmon sashimi beef tataki everything came out perfect the tartar was so yummy we had to order both the tuna and the yellowtail the salmon sashimi was the best i ve had thus far it was so buttery and fresh our bill came out around 70 because we ordered two large beers but it was definitely worth it for the quality i m probably going to come back here every time i m in vegas now it s located in a small plaza with limited parking during dinner time
  better than expected for las vegas the produce is top notch for a steak house and a highlight of the meal the dry aged ny steak and simply seasoned with salt and pepper was one of the best i ever had i am definitely a fan the one thing that needs improvement is the front of the house hostesses who were not as polished as one expects from a gourmet restaurant
  thank you jay and chef payton for bringing boa bistro to east mesa boa bistro is a much welcomed and superb addition to the nonexistent food scene in mesa i now have three mesa foodie spots to frequent and boa bistro might be my favorite in all the valley yes boa bistro is very new and still in its growing stages the staff is in training the outdoor patio not yet complete but i found the atmosphere and service to be top notch the wait staff is very friendly professional and helpful kristen at the bar was wonderful the decor is modern with a large white bar funky lighting and a clear walk in wine room that boasts the impressive selection of wines this location is smaller than the one in tempe but that only adds intimacy to the experience the best part of boa bistro is the wood fired oven and chef payton s station at the front of the restaurant if you can sit at the bar and you ll be able to watch chef payton and his very friendly sous chef scooter in action at their station they prepare the salads roast the oven fired entrees slice the meats and cheeses and even assemble the desserts if they have a moment they might deliver your course to your table and give you an explanation of the dish both chef payton and jay the owner took the time to say hello and welcome me to their new location they are a lot of fun the menu is simple highlighting the fresh locally sourced ingredients there are a few familiar dishes from the tempe location including the mussels and the shrimp starters the panzanella salad and the mushroom ravioli the rest of the menu seems new and delicious i very much intended to have the meatball bruschetta and the gnocchi carbonara but was seduced by the 30 menu special of the night choice of salad to start choice of fire roasted trout for 2 mussel entree or mn meatloaf and choice of dessert tiramisu brownie or cappucino the panzanella salad is the perfect winter medley with marinated mushrooms and butternut squash the trout is beautifully served as a full fish cleanly de boned with skin on cooked with almond butter and capers and served with an arugula salad and green garlic potato puree divine the tiramisu is award winning with the perfect proportion of deliciously fluffy mascarpone cream to espresso soaked ladyfingers the entire meal was excellent and was served at a leisurely pace that is ideal for savoring every bite the pacing of courses is something that many restaurants need to learn and one aspect of my experience at boa bistro that i greatly appreciated and enjoyed relax and enjoy the food boa bistro is a foodie paradise local fresh ingredients outstanding menu and wine list intimate setting and personable chef and staff drive out to mesa and try it you will not be disappointed you can follow chef payton on twitter chefp8n and get great updates on specials and daily ingredients buon appetito
  the best fresh fish in the area delectable sashimi and amazing service the fish tank is a fun touch too
  we hebben de dinner buffet en lunch buffet gedaan er is veel keuze aan gerechten maar dat is ook al naar onze belgische normen is deze buffet overroepen het eten was lauw en de zaal was koud er hadden verschillende mensen hun jassen aan wij hebben al over de hele wereld buffetten gegeten en deze behoort tot de minste zeker voor de prijs die je moet betalen het enige verschil met de lunch en dinner buffet is dat je bij de dinner scampi s waterachtig en krabbenpoten krijgt de soep was wel lekker en het personeel is zeer gedreven en vriendelijk
  one star removed from the last review still slow and disorganized food is still over cooked and under seasoned honestly i don t know why we went back when we were so disappointed the first time we tried this buffet will never be returning to lago and i mean it this time
  worst service ever the waitress was super aggresive the first 5 minutes we were there then we did not see her again for an hour we sat with food we hadnt touched in 40 minutes with no waitstaff in sight to give us boxes when we finally did get our boxes and asked for the check it took another 20 minutes to get it then the cc machine was down and it took another 20 minutes to get a reciept they ended up charging my card almost 3 months later what a waste of time and money i have had great experiences with other locations but this almost makes me not want to go back to any of them
  four words chicken nuggets waffle fries yum chick fil a has the best chicken nuggets they are real pieces of chicken they aren t minced chicken formed into nuggets they have lots of dipping sauces to choose from buffalo ranch and bbq to name a few the chick fil a sauce is my favorite and no one else has waffle fries of course a milkshake makes it a great trio i also like their chicken wraps and chicken soup the customer service is outstanding and the restaurant is always clean it s very kid friendly and there is a play place for them they even have someone who comes around asking if you need refills and taking your trash no other fast food place i know of does that
  finally getting the opportunity to dine at twist i couldn t resist the tasting menu the restaurant is located inside the mandarin oriental and every seat includes dazzling views of the strip without going over each course in detail i will say every bite was absolutely delicious and i can t think of a better fine dining experience that i have had in the last few years it was gluttonous divine and my dining companions left with bright smiles on our faces and full stomachs before we left we each received a personalized signed menu from the evening which was a treat service was impeccable as expected and i can t think of one thing about the meal wasn t sheer perfection the perfect way to spend three hours on a saturday night in vegas
  pike s is right behind my office and when i don t feel like driving somewhere or just want some good comfort food for lunch this is the best option the grilled cheese is really pretty awesome it s got two kinds of oozy gooey super melted cheese on it and when i ask for it to be well done it comes out perfect yay the pecan fried chicken is another good one its sweet and savory and all kinds of bad for you but hey sometimes you gotta splurge it comes with a broccoli casserole which is also delicious and the mashed potatoes which i do not love but that s okay you can sub a different side for 1 desserts are very tempting so far though i have resisted except i was given a slice of the mousse cake for my bday fro my boss how could i say no to the boss its a cheesecake with layers of the chocolate mousse it was really silky and smooth tasting very decadent and very delicious luckily i had co workers help me eat it the prices are very reasonable here service is hit or miss i feel like they just drop you check right after you get your food which is odd because i eat lunch at off peak times so its not like they need the table no matter i sit and read and enjoy my food and leave when i am ready otherwise everything else is great
  came here for a quick breakfast with my wife before work the giant banner advertising their breakfast caught our eyes so we headed over instead of getting starbucks we seated ourselves and raised the flag it was a slow morning as there weren t many people inside i ordered their breakfast burrito with the sausage gravy it was flavorful and huge at first i thought the addition of gravy was strange but it proved to be a very delicious topper my wife had the strawberry french toast it looked and tasted like candy it was very good sharing the two meals made for a nice mixture of salt and sweet while this wouldn t be my first choice for breakfast i wouldn t hesitate to come again if i want a cheap fast breakfast
  best sauces in town can t go wrong with bean and cheese with crispy papas and sour cream
  great pizza and customer service i really like the diavola love the big wood tables
  food was decent but the service was flat out terrible they quoted having communication problems but it was just a disastrous mess of customer service we waited 30 mins for our food without being checked up on only plus was the better than average chicken sandwich i had dtm out
  another sign the economy is improving flemings has tightened up their happy hour gone is the seared ahi and the classic martini the happy hour drink and food specials that remain are tasty but just don t cut it due to the limited selection and small portion sizes
  there is a lot to like about roaring fork however a few hiccups lead me to a 3star review with a couple fixes i could easily add a star maybe 2 went to roaring fork for happy hour last friday it was a fairly warm day although nothing like the summer days we ve been having the bar was packed so we opted for a spot on the patio we got there shortly before 5 so we were surprised that it was already that full that being said easy fix go earlier on a friday the chairs out on the patio are fairly uncomfortable i m not an enormous guy but i m also not 120lbs the narrow weird shape of the patio chairs were fairly uncomfortable the women with us did not notice a problem every guy did the overall value is great for happy hour most drink specials are 5 5 in scottsdale hard to beat the sweet carolina was a combo of sweet tea vodka and lemonade just the right amount of sweetness very tasty the guava mojitos were also a highlight very tasty the wife enjoyed the huckleberry margaritas as well all 5 the food was solid we shared the green chile pork with warm buttered tortillas i m a bit of a tortilla snob so wasn t thrilled by the thicker think mission brand flour tortillas but the green chile was very good not really spicy would have been nice but great flavor the best part of the food in my opinion was the 1 2 rotisserie chicken with tortillas the chicken was perfectly tender juicy and seasoned great bird service was somewhat slow but they were jam packed and we were outside on a hot patio so i suppose that can be overlooked while they were slow they were very friendly very helpful and overall pleasant just needed to come around a bit more often the restrooms especially for the guys are a bit of a trek you walk all the way to the back of the restaurant make like you re walking back into the office building just before you re enter the offices you hit the women s bathroom the men s restroom is actually back inside the office building just a short walk down the hallway a little inconvenient but let s be honest i m not going to count out a restaurant just because their restaurant isn t exactly where i want it i have legs so i can walk overall 3 stars i would definitely return i would love to sit inside and see if service improves i would also prefer to sit at a booth rather than outside on the patio chairs apparently my giant ass was not meant to sit there the food and drink not to mention the happy hour prices make this place more than worth it
  always consistent and the execution is on point the food and staff do not disappoint
  below average food below average service above average prices bad combo spent over a hundred for 4 people before tip and everything was just blah that only included 3 bottles of beer too tough ribs kfc coleslaw steak fries out of the bag dry brisket catch my drift it says on the menu yelp about this facebook that twitter this cheesy i want to say good stuff but the whole place is weird and there is nothing bbq about it before you encourage your patrons to yelp about this maybe make sure it is worth yelping about
  so i was looking for a place to eat my last meal in charlotte and this restaurant came up on my phone so i figured give it a try i went in there and was great by the host i checked out the menu and they had a list of different pizzas i wanted to try two different ones and they said they can put half and half on a whole pizza so i was like cool the pizza came out but it was on a plate which was pretty small if your going to eat a dinner there or a main course that was pretty small like an appetizer i ate there italian one and there chicken garlic one on the other half portions were pretty small and i wish i had a bigger portion for a main course
  not always what you pay is what you get because it s vegas the majority of restaurants go for at the least 25 per person here price is equivalent to mediocrity my party of 3 paid almost 100 including tip for thin steak 4 scallops and a tablespoon of salmon tartar i ve been to france and portions aren t that small they sat us in an area where we could view the strip nothing special but at least the servers were friendly and consistently check on you
  teeming masses of hungry foodies have overrun chelsea s original location making the parking situation difficult but not impossible you ll need to be somewhat creative the problem as i like to define it is this the lure of a fine meal fast service and reasonable prices simply won t dispel the shame associated with blowing a valet hello chelsea s airport a mere five miles from the original located in terminal 4 this location is never crowded and if you re in a hurry they offer a chelsea s express window adjacent to the entrance on my most recent visit the rotisserie prime rib was in order fortunately they had an end cut available making the experience even more enjoyable the sides were equally delicious blanched cold green beans in a light lemon vinaigrette along with a dd cup of garlic mashed potatoes nom nom nom oh and the parking is ample sky harbor terminal 4 charging only four dollars per hour four bucks that s it a lot less messy too any bets on how long it takes for yelphq to remove this one i ve never made their rotd award but i do routinely win their other rotd award removal of the day
  first timer at yagyu i took my parents out for dinner for my mom s birthday happy birthday mom we ordered the family special for 39 95 and there was more than enough food for three people fyi the special offers two bowls of rice and two bowls of miso additional costs for extra starters miso soup house salad california roll assorted kimchi seaweed salad edamame meats kalbi rib eye beef tongue harami and chicken shrimp and sausage too additional items gyoza chicken katsu and karaage the assortment of meats were tender and flavorful the seafood salad was good and the karaage was really juicy i was not a fan of the gyoza or miso soup but the chicken katsu was on point overall the food was great pricing was fair and the service was excellent
  ok so lets just get something straight here this isn t a place for a spectacular gourmet meal or anything conversely burritos the size of your head come on it is just down right monstrous honestly though the burritos and other various menu items seem to be made with high quality ingredients quickly and for a reasonable price it is some pretty good football game food after a few beers i would have to say that although i know the food is good to people walking by it may sort of seem like a dump some simple seating for you to devour your pile of food and no special decorations or theme for that matter within its walls once again though i think of this place more as a place to refuel than an experience
  great service friendly staff extensive menu and excellent execution waffles or french toast are delicious breakfast doesn t get much better
  food was cold took way too long to get served standard breakfast fare eggs pancakes hash browns bacon wasn t expecting much but a little good service since there were only four tables of customers no luck no check back no water or coffee refills and really felt i was invisible while the waitresses socialized with whom i suspect were friends waited 15 minutes after i was done with my meal and finally i tagged a different waiter and told him i ve been waiting for ever for someone to come over his response was it s not his fault he just came on duty no coming back here
  damn good dim sum reason enough to give strip mall chinese restaurants an honest shake finally another chinese restaurant in the valley worth patronizing
  i was treated to a lovely dinner here and found the restaurant to be a ok the service was good and the food was delicious the prices are reasonable too after drinks dinner and dessert we weren t left feeling like we paid too much
  every time i ve ever been here for lunch or with a friend the service has been timely and friendly i ve order simple slices to go and full pizzas the mix drinks are yum i usually try whatever drink my server recommends and i m never disappointed love the remodel and booths that have been put in
  great place great food my family said they loved the food and they wanted to come back very soon the price is extremely reasonable will be back very soon
  we had spent the afternoon out in the hot sun and hadn t eaten all day i m the kind of girl that needs to eat every two hours or i grow a second head and start screaming about any minuscule thing that happens to set me off needless to say i needed to eat before someone got hurt we had been wanting to try north end pizza for awhile so when i felt like devouring 56 slices of saucy cheesey goodness after my day in the sun we decided to finally make the stop no debating for me over what to order margherita special for the day yes in a large please and a side of fries the fries weren t great weren t bad i dumped some garlic salt on them and they instantly improved they brought out the pizza and i was a little disappointed it was a bit skimpy on the cheese after my first slice i was hooked the crust is thin but not super thin the sauce has a lot of flavor and the mozzarella what there was of it was fresh my husband and i ate the entire large pizza right then and there
  i passed this place while paying bills i thought id pick my bf up and try it out for lunch they just opened a few weeks ago so it was quiet inside only two other tables we started off with the crispy asparagus roll 9 it was kalua pork cream cheese around the asparagus wrapped with a fried phylo dough side of lime and sambal delicious next the chicken lettuce wraps 10 not going to explain because it wasn t anything special it was not good however my fried egg grilled cheese brought me back home to the islands i think one of the chefs has to be from hawaii imagine mozzarella grilled cheese with tomato sweetness of the bacon ahhh and topped off with a perfectly cooked fried egg yum and only for 10 my bf got the shrimp caprese pasta 14 i thought it was ok just needed a little more love in the dish but hes a chef and was totally not having it needed salt acidity and yes love well that sums up the food part service was ok but ill give them a break because they had just opened wont be rushing back in but will not be avoiding it as well
  its tommy s what else do i have to say if you grew up in southern california you know what i m talking about if not give them a try if you like old school drive in style burgers and fries you won t be disappointed if you have a weak stomach this probably isn t the place for you but it s damn good either way
  yum i had the green chili burger and husband had mushroom burger both were very good would eat here again
  great happy hour with cheap margs is the best thing blue agave has to offer atmopshere is lacking not fun or authentic maybe after a couple of margs it appears to be decent but really not a hot spot that makes me want to go back there are other local places for hh nearby so i wouldn t go out of the way to come here foodwise i wouldn t really bother
  awesome place great food also great for get togethers very inexpensive as far as partys go i had the best going away party here thanks nicole everything was great
  pros the crab legs are already pre cut yay for no painful and tedious shell cracking for small pieces of crab meat great omlettes really good for breakfast loved the dessert cons overpriced not enough variety would love to go again if it wasn t 35 00
  this place took me by surprise from the outside it really doesn t look like much but when you get inside it s a wide open almost loft like space with an open kitchen and plenty of seating but the true test of course is the quality of the food and i m happy to report that the barbecue here is on par with old hickory house and bill spoon s that is to say it s really good not quite as smoky as midwood smokehouse but still very nice with one way and those others charlotte is becoming a town that can actually boast of having a variety of good barbecue joints each with its own personality i got the 5 lunch special your choice of bbq meat creamy slaw hushpuppies and a self serve fountain soda with free refills and while everything was very tasty i was somewhat disappointed by the small portion size i found it almost insulting that they put only two thumb sized hushpuppies in the basket lunch deal portion size aside this place is a hit i ll be back and next time i ll spring for the big platter
  i like it the bartenders and staff are super nice and the atmosphere is very chill loved the gin and earl grey martini and the posole is very tasty if you re a menudo fan great place to hangout on a laid back weekend night
  i ate at snooze for the first time on sunday and enjoyed the experience i love all of the little restaurants in the downtown gilbert area and snooze is a great addition the atmosphere is great and the service is good we went early so we were seated right away but as we were leaving there seemed to be a little wait the reason i am giving 3 stars is because the breakfast burrito i ordered was very spicy so much so that i did not eat much of it the server really wanted to take it back and give me something else but i really do not like to do that or waste food so i brought the rest home there should be a warning in the menu about how spicy it is our server said a lot of people have been saying that recently so hopefully they do i plan to come back and try it again because my mom loved her pancakes and i really want to try one of the morning cocktails
  great food bar service prices atmosphere waiters will bring over ice cream from next door one time they gave us cookies that they haven t sold for the day the food is great comfort food the macaroni and cheese or ruben sandwiches are both amazing with a delicious draft beer it s a great date spot because of the slight conversational noise but it s not annoyingly loud and the 80s and 90s music they play is always interesting to listen to i ll come back again and again
  this place gets packed at night on any day they actually charge you to get in lol didn t try any food just got some drinks their drink specials are pretty good
  wow simply put this was one of the best meals i ve ever had i had the pan seared salmon the salmon itself was excellent very juicy and perfectly seared but the surprising part was the garnishes there was some kind of garlic butter spinach on top and the plate was lined with a pesto sauce can t remember what kind the tastiest part of the meal however besides the salmon was the creamed white corn that the salmon rested upon i ve never liked creamed corn from the can but this was very good it had the consistency of cream of wheat and not the nasty slimy creamed corn you used to eat as a kid great great food i will definitely go back i d like to try one of their steaks next time i go
  there is something for everyone healthy and tasty i take my clients here often and end up eating here 2 3 times a week i can always try something new and be happy with it
  if your into all things smoked or bbq this place it the place for you the b b ribs are fall off the bone delicious love the ambiance low lights and country music don t worry about not getting dessert they give you complimentary freshly made doughnuts yummy x100 lunch time is the best time love the wait staff good job you guys
  great food and wonderful owner there is a lot of pride that goes into the food here i had a lamb gyro and was still hungry afterwards so i ordered a chicken gyro to go this is the best 10 i ve spent in a really long time authentic greek flavors at really great prices from now on when i find myself near dana park i ll skip the fancy mall and come here instead
  i love this place everytime i come to scottsdale i have to visit a couple of times too no matter what i try i m never disappointed never last night i had the chimichanga sp and it was delicious i felt it could have been shared but it made for a great lunch today
  went here for dinner with a few friends and i must admit i was not totally au fait with giving it four stars it s more like a 3 5 for me than a 4 the menu is good and the place was packed on a monday night it is obviously popular and probably not reliant on my review for success the choices are better than you expect in a vegetarian place and the food is served beautifully and looks good my starter was served beautifully but it lacked flavour for what was a thai inspired starter my main course tasted delicious but it felt like there were three different meals on one plate as none of it went together but individually tasted excellent in general the food lacked a bit of seasoning the wine list is nice and reasonable and the service is also good it is a cut above many places that serves vegetarian food but for the prices you pay i expect more i would come back here however won t hurry back
  a great place to get takeout the restaurant itself is nothing much not a ton of atmosphere they do however have great gyros their world famous gyros are only 5 each they always taste fresh and they are filling i also recommend their spanikopita and baklava the walnut one their appetizer hummuses are not worthwhile
  i recently came to fukumimi with a friend who has been raving about it for a while i must say i agree the ramen in incredible i tried the spicy tonkotsu ramen and thought it was fabulous i think this might be my favorite ramen place just because other places their broth seems so heavy from the pork my ramen s broth was very flavorful without being overpowering i also ordered a sapporo for 2 90 that s a steal the service is very nice and attentive and the restaurant is small but clean big thumbs up i will definitely be back soon it s a great option if you are visiting the aveda institute
  great happy hour specials good prices even outside of happy hour love the pork verde dish on the appetizer menu but you wouldn t go wrong with any of the appetizers or dinner items drinks are a bargain their patron fusion is by far the strongest margarita i ve had in the valley and very tasty you definitely wouldn t go wrong dining here
  i don t live in champaign anymore but i come back to eat here it s of course a no frills plastic fork kind of place but if you order off their chinese menu you will not be disappointed their spicy pig intestine stew is probably the best dish i have ever eaten every time i go i take an order with me when i am eating it in chicago it is so good it makes me want to move back c u has always had better asian food than chicago but this dish and it s always a little different sends me to the moon i can t speak for their sesame chicken or their egg foo young and if i was as talented as the person in that kitchen i would be insulted seeing that kind of order come up that being said they should probably alter the ambience but hell they are mainly existing to serve chinese students who want authentic chinese food not people who want a fine dining experience as long as that dish stays good i will always come back they have wonderful food and i like that the prices are lower because there are no waiters or flatware i would pay 30 dollars for the intestine dish i am glad i can still get it for 12
  my family and i are new to the area the first mail we got came from this restaurant and it was a 10 gift certificate it was very thoughtful i must say so i took my brother and my boyfriend to come and check this place out the first thing i noticed was a very helpful waiter she was awfully nice and seemed like a people person the environment was nice and they put in a lot of effort to give it that chicago vibe all in all it is definitely worth checking out
  i have had my shares of taiwanese hot pot and popcorn chicken and pot of tea s food in general is made with fresh ingredients with no mosh the broth is clear and tasty made from your perfected choice of hot pot ingredients the popcorn chicken batter is light filled with traditional taiwanese flavors also the teas are not heavily sweeten like most tea house too the ambiance us nice and clean and attentive staff i am very satisfied with my overall experience
  well i guess poutine is not my thing at least resto la banquise s take on poutine wasn t i know there are lots of foreigners and locals alike who love and swear by this restaurant but i m just not a fan my thoughts on the regular poutine i wasn t a fan of the gravy i thought it was bland and watery combined with the fries the poutine was very heavy and soggy i think it would have been better paired with fries that could withstand the gravy so it won t turn out gloppy i agree with another reviewer the poutine had some sort of strange sweetness not sure if this was the combination of the ingredients or just one ingredient portion sizes were massive we asked the waitress for her recommendation on portion sizes and she thought that between two people we d be able to eat a small poutine for a meal and regular sized poutine to share plus other food my boyfriend ended up eating his small size but we barely made a dent in the regular size for sure a regular size would be able to be shared with at least three people i did enjoy my montreal style hot dog though a steamie on a buttered and toasted hot dog roll the line was pretty long to get seated but it moved around dinner time we managed to stay in line for about 30 minutes we opted to sit outside in the patio where we were serenaded by some early 2000 s pop and hip hop music totally geared towards the younger crowd for foreigners they only take local canadian cards no mastercard visa so cash is best hopefully my next trip into montreal i ll find another poutine place to try out
  my wife and i get breakfast up here on the weekends sometimes we have to wait for a table but if you get there early enough that s never a problem the food is great she normally gets the ham scramble and i love the pancakes
  one of my new favorite places you can tell they pay attention to every detail from the ingredients they use to the quality of service everyone is friendly love sitting inside to watch the line the burgers are amazing as well as the chips i am confident everything on the menu is amazing
  i was really looking forward to cut and was hoping i would have liked it better than i did it was a good experience its a sleek modern ambiance and the service is top notch the waiters go above and beyond they re helpful pay attention to detail and educate a bit too much i don t care if voss water is from norway service wise it was what you d expect from a top notch steakhouse they bring out the steaks on a platter of course pointing to the most expensive waygu ribeye and recommending it very heavily i went with the bone in ribeye and was disappointed granted i m very particular of my steaks and steakhouses i kept on thinking how i could make a better steak myself i ordered the steak medium rare but it was more of a medium cook it had a dryness that didn t bod well with me i was surprised the marbling and bone didn t give the steak much flavor either sides were good mac and cheese was mac and cheese solid but nothing special potatoes were good went well with the steak i ve heard some people say that they love this steakhouse which i find surprising with so many other great steakhouses in vegas i wouldn t come here again
  i feel like i just spent 15 on a puny salad and french fries i could ve got in the freezer section at von s i ordered two meals to go one for lunch and one to bring to work for later i ordered the falafel sandwich and the chicken shawarma for lunch i tried half of each and both were completely disgusting the falafel sandwich tasted like the sauce had soured like milk i opened it up and the lettuce inside was completely rotten and brown the falafel tasted old and terrible the chicken shawarma was dry as hell and almost paste like so needless to say the only thing edible was the french fries and the puny salad that came with the meal now i feel sick and have nothing to take to work for food yuck never again sad day
  after hearing so many good things about pikolo i had to try it out and it did not let me down the coffee here is excellent and they always do a little foam art in your coffee which is a nice little touch i get the latte usually which always hits the spot their baked goods are also worth trying i ve only ever had the brownie but it was a mighty good one just note that the cafe is kind of small so seating can be hard to come by especially when it s exam time at mcgill the cafe is located in the heart of the mcgill ghetto so it s a popular study spot don t let this discourage you from checking it out though it s definitely a great coffee shop
  i took my niece here for her birthday i believe our server was named jared he was very friendly and a great server he really made my niece feel special on her birthday we always come here for special occasions because we know we will be treated with great service
  went for lunch and was impressed with how express their lunch menu was the server made me feel like i was bugging him a bit at first but was friendly once i was leaving maybe telling him how good it was helped my case too the salad was super boring but the jerk chicken was really tasty a great find for an escape from work at lunchtime
  another example of how pittsburgh restaurants are killing it lately we made reservations for this place early in the day at the recommendation of family who live in the area throughout the day i asked locals where a good place to eat was and most of them pointed us here went here with some family the design of this place especially the ceiling behind the bar was amazing i would describe this as a dim sum meets tapas sort of vibe alot of shared plates mainly a asian and french feel we tried the roast pork ramen this was enough to bring me back perfectly cooked 5 minute egg the pigface sandwich i need this in my life daily the roast pork dim sum the kimchi get this with anything you order it is the perfect tang the scorpion bowl watch out for the fire had a small paper umbrella set a scorch on ours but my boy scout training lead me to extinguish the flame no worries i am craving this place as i type pro tip if you get the ramen and are a slurper like me wear a bib i lost a shirt to their amazing ramen broth but it was worth it
  man look at those ratings either love it or hate it anyway i was so excited to go here but was kinda let down because i expected it to be an extravagant las vegas all out type of deal but it just looked like an old run down hotel too far to walk to from with a new hooters sign i mean the hooter girl slot machines and the big orange jeep or was it a hummer that was on display was pretty cool eh i was just expecting too much i guess
  a friend and i ate breakfast there this past weekend and we both really liked it we arrived around 10 00 am on sunday and there was no wait at all we got seated right away though within 30 minutes or so there was a queue lots of people waiting for a table an hour later as we left i ordered a belgian waffle a side of bacon and coffee coffee was okay normal restaurant coffee belgian waffle was delicious light and airy great taste and still hot which is always an issue when eating out as they seem to cool down really fast the bacon was too crispy for my taste and i would ve much preferred thick cut but it was okay my friend ordered the french toast also with a side of bacon she orders french toast almost everytime we meet for breakfast let me say it was a large plate of food i think 5 slices of french toast and she ate almost every bite and she s a little thing she said it was fantastic our server was really nice and cheerful and the interior was clean and neat though small lots to choose from on the menu and i ll try something new next time i ll definitely eat there again
  i have eaten twice for lunch since it open and has become my favorite buffet here in vegas even at lunch there is a huge selection with several live food stations need to come back here to check out their dinner the only downside of this place is when it is busy for me i hate crowds probably why i have avoided coming here for dinner even at lunch there are lines to to get food their meat station is heavenly prime rib slab bacon smoked sausages ribs lamp chops and the list goes on if your up for it get the tomahawk ribeye steak large piece of ribeye with the whole rib still attached favorite section here is the chinese food pretty decent chinese selection for a buffet try their xiao long bao soup dumpling did not expect it to be as good as it was the skin was not too thick or dry especially sitting on a buffet line the ginseng soup was on point though i don t think it was made with black chicken service was excellent our plates were cleared immediately after we were finish the waiter waitress came by frequently to check on us
  i ve tried the poutine all over montreal and definitely decarie s is one of the best it s the sauce that has some zing to it check out the chicken club sandwich that s made with real chicken breast and not that pressed garbage
  i have been to harley s twice and both times the service and food have been great the food is always hot and has great flavors the wine is a pretty small but good selection i would go here again to avoid the chain places like olive garden or oreganos
  we have been going to fleur de lys for years there are so many reasons why we love going here the food the service the people the atmosphere the wine and the cocktails jason makes the best drinks we really enjoy his pomegranate cosmo tonight we went for dinner and we had a fantastic meal we arrived early so we could partake in the 59 early evening tasting special my in laws are from boca raton florida they were speaking their language we were lucky to get one of the cabanas and that was perfect with our four year old she was delighted to have a place that seemed like it was made just for her and she was an angel of a guest for the evening we thank the chef for his special rice that kept her occupied was there cat nip in there purrr we opted for a tasting menu that included the fantastic onion soup with truffles it is what onion dreams are made of it is not your traditional onion soup it is an updated version that is creamy and delicious we loved every spoonful and the short ribs were tender and tasty my father in law enjoyed the salmon and it looked beautiful every dish is a piece of art for dessert we had a selection of treats we had the chocolate souffle along with a mocha shake and a scoop of ice cream yummy what a great ending to a perfect meal chef keller created a fantastic haven in las vegas and we can t wait to go back again and again
  the food here is amazing try the of the hook burger it s delicious the name definitely fits the ambiance is pretty cool they have all the current sports games playing will definitely come back
  good solid meal nice choices on the menu i had the purple drink very tasty chicken just lacked the flavor i was looking for nice atmosphere
  spak is by far my favorite pizzeria in the city and not only because it s a half block from my house i have sampled most of their menu and enjoyed all of it their seitan wings are crispy saucy and delicious the pittsburgh steak and pittsburgh steak are two of my favorites sliced seitan or steak with a kitchen sink topping scheme that includes fries and a fried egg perfection their pizza is also really great but i think they really shine with their subs
  still the best tofu soup i have ever had and i have been in seoul for two months of the last year this is about as authentic as this soup can get warning spicy means korean spicy and if you aren t familiar with that then be prepared koreans know spicey
  this is a review for their banquet menu as i was here with a group the first course is a trio of pastas each with their own sauce a few tortellini s a ravioli and i don t remember what the third was it was a little overcooked but the best thing i had next was the salad wow what tough lettuce leafs other than that is was ok just a basic dinner salad nothing to set it apart for the main course we had a choice between filet mignon sea bass or chicken they ran out of my first choice the fish so i went with the chicken the description sounded good but it wasn t i didn t realize it was going to be breaded and the breading was mushy underneath the chicken was dry and overdone who picks these places seriously i need to figure out who plans these company functions and introduce them to the wonderful world of yelp i think it would have significant positive impact for the company as a whole employee morale would go up individual performance would soar productivity would increase we would gain market share and before you know it we would be topping forbes top companies to work for lists
  food was awesome and the stoli doli was great service was great atmosphere was top notche
  we sat down and waited for five minutes only to be completely ignored only one other table was seated so they weren t busy we finally walked out we won t be back if i could give it half a star i would
  wow when you walk in here you can tell this is a real food joint as you get a strong aroma of seafood and garlic my friend mentioned the better deal is the shrimp as you get more meat than the crawfish so we ordered a bag of shrimp with sausage each i also ordered some rice to soak up the juice we prepared for the meal by putting on the clothes protecting bibs that they provide you 2 bags came out and we digged in man the flavour of the sauce with garlic is just amazing let me say however that there is a ton of garlic so much garlic that it stayed on my palate the whole night however it s totally worth it for the experience to wash it down we had a couple of blue moon s so damm tasty these places don t come around very often
  sorry kona grill we used to have a decent relationship my fiancee and i used to hit up kg for happy hour and easy you know what you re getting sushi however i am writing on behalf of my mom and step dad who both got poisoning from the chandler mall kg within a few hours of eating there they both fell really sick i ll spare you the details my mom called that night to let the manger know and just see if he could look into it they weren t asking for their money back or any kind of compensation at all the manager said he would look into it and call her back the next day i was there when he called and literally blamed my mom step dad for whatever food they had eaten prior to coming there he stated that actually food poisoning doesn t occur until 48 72 hours after eating the contaminated food really check your facts buddy it occurs within 4 6 hours of eating the bad food which is exactly when they got sick the real disappointment of this story is that the manager didn t take any responsibility whatsoever i don t care if you think your restaurant is perfectly clean and clear of food contamination if 2 customers fell ill after eating there then you at least apologize and admit it could have possibly been the source instead of telling them they re wrong and misquoting facts in trying times like today s economy you would like to think that businesses owners manager would like to keep customers at all costs i won t be going back to that kg and i know the word was spread on facebook about my mom s experience others chimed in about similar experiences so the least we can do it spread the word since kg won t take any responsibility update i wrote this review with a 1 star rating originally as you can see from my notes it was not a pleasant ordeal however i would like to personally thank llyod hawhthorn for taking the time to reach out to my mom and rectifying the situation lloyd is the district manager and i have to say that it means a lot to know that they took our experience and concern seriously the one thing my mom was hoping to achieve was some form of concern or positive feedback from kg and that is what ended up happening so thank you lloyd for making it right and we will be returning to kg even got some gift cards as christmas gifts i hope all goes well from here
  i came here for lunch and was rather disappointed with both the service and the food we were a large party of 8 but the restaurant was not very busy and service was still slow the waitress had to be asked multiple times to bring napkins etc and didn t really check in even getting the check and getting out was slow the food took a long time to come out i had the pulled pork tacos and was very disappointed they were so greasy and didn t have a ton of flavor i got the bottom of the barrel fries which did not impress either i wanted to like this place but would not recommend it based on my experience
  very excited to have this place near me we stopped in for a quick dinner on saturday night the place is nicely furnished and simple and clean the menu is the perfect size not too overwhelming we tried a few things the zaru tofu was really good very filling we had the toro sashimi and that was delish the yuzu sorbet was yummy too will definitely go back and try more they have omikase which i want to do
  amazing views of las vegas from our outside dining location favorite items ordered tuna tartare and the scallop entree great service
  this is the best place to eat in north town i am constantly there the lemonade is delicious you should try it with strawberries and there milkshakes are to die for even better when theyre half priced from 3 5 but the coolest thing about this place is the super tall employee that walks around the dinning room he says his name is lemmon which is a really awesome name but he is the best employee they have there he got me all the sauces i asked for and even offered to get me a refill when i was running low on my beverage i only go when hes there because he knows my favorite sauces and my choice of beverage i recommand this place for everyone
  loved it went here for lunch today kind of weird because we were the only people in there the whole time which is usually a bad sign but the food was awesome we both had plain old burgers which were juicy and cooked perfectly got the 1 2 fries and 1 2 rings rings were the best and i ate all of them prices were fine will definitely be going there again sometime
  so i must be crazy because every time i see a groupon for this place i buy it i think my memories and actual experiences do not line up so i had yet another deal for this place and i decided to go there with the bf for lunch today to celebrate end of school the place was fairly empty but the decor is still nice i ended up ordering the bhan mi sandwich at the suggestion of the waitress and the bf got the turkey sandwich we both got the side of the day which was a sweet potato corn bread with honey and fruit butter so the sandwiches come out and i was a bit confused on the menu it said that the bhan mi was roasted pork with carrots cilantro cucumber and a sriracha mayo well this sandwich was not roasted pork it was strips of ham like deli ham wtf this sandwich costs 10 50 i could go buy some deli meat and veggies and throw it in a pan for 5 seconds for about 2 i don t even like ham and would never order a ham sandwich isn t this restaurant supposed to be all about freshness and organic and whatnot because deli ham is anything but why can america s tacos sell delicious roasted pork for about 2 and this place doesn t even really use roasted pork in addition i was about half done with the first half of the sandwich and i found a whole slice of jalapeno in my mouth my mouth was on fire i couldn t eat anymore of the sandwich my eyes were watering and i like spicy and use jalapenos in a lot of my cooking ugh i liked the turkey sandwich but on the menu it states that it comes with bacon well no bacon really center bistro why have a menu when apparently you just put whatever you feel like putting in the food the corn bread was good and the butter that came with it was good too but i felt extremely ripped off by my meal there today it was unacceptable i find myself wondering if their breakfast or newly added dinners would be better as the dinner menu looks good but i m worried if i go for something on said menu i ll just get some random other thing that i did not want so we ll see if i give it another go
  8am in vegas half the city is still asleep praline truffle piping hot americano woke me right up love their clean fancy chocolate display cafe chairs setup right outside but it s odd to me that one can enjoy yummy eats in a smoke filled casino bonus for easy grab just a step from the room towers
  we ordered delivery and when the driver got to our house he gave us a total that was 2 higher than what we were told on the phone we asked why the total was different and he proceeded to explain that it was an additional delivery fee my husband suspiciously paid him and gave him tip on top of that then we checked the pizza box and realized we were right and he completely overcharged us by making up an additional delivery fee we called the store manager he told us the driver read the total wrong and sent the driver back to our house to give us the overpaid cash back wtf why would you put a customer who just got intentionally ripped off by your employee into such an awkward position when we told the manager we didn t want the driver to come back and would rather just keep the credit on our account he said he didn t have a way of getting in touch with him and he was already coming ha are you kidding is the manager in on this scam the driver came back and yep it was pretty awkward worst pizza delivery ever buyer beware don t pay extra delivery fees
  not a bad place to go have a beer and some pub grub the food is not bad at all with the exception of the wings which are bland and unimpressive and they have some good bottled beer unfortunately they only have two beers on tap i would stop by more often if they would add a few taps the atmoshphere is pretty standard for a sports type bar and the waitstaff seems to be friendly and attentive overall this is a great place to stop by and have a beer or to bring your kids but please add a few more taps
  don t waste your time i am giving 1 star because the dj was good food tasted like salty bar food servers looked and acted as if their lives are miserable we attempted to joke and lighten up the mood no smiles not one by our two servers instead of engaging with us the servers were more concerned with cleaning up our table while we are eating dinner taking flowers away the flowers weren t so bad worst service we have ever experienced in a restaurant or whatever it is
  went to which wich for lunch yesterday and as always wonderful service and yummy sandwich jen b must have taken her nasty pill on 6 1
  upon arriving to this restaurant we were greeted by a host that did not even look up at us he asked us can i help you while staring down at the counter we said we would like a table for 2 he showed us to our table did not even bother to pull out my chair for me and proceeded to hand us our menus handing my fiance his first we were seated about 10 15 minutes before our waiter showed up we ordered an appetizer main course and i ordered a glass of wine our appetizer came out beef carpaccio and it was delicious about 2 bites away from finishing our appetizer 15 minutes after i ordered it my wine showed up next were 2 caesar salads which we each took a few bites of and were done with the dressing was bland and the salad was overall very weak also when our waiter offered us pepper on our salad he again went to my fiance first our meals came out i got the veal piccatta which was actually very good my fiance got the chicken parmigiana and a side of pasta of which both were swimming in sauce now on their menu it says all fresh ingredients but it is very obvious the chicken was previously frozen on a scale of 1 10 i would rate my meal a 7 and he rated his a 3 i finished the meal with the spumoni gelato of course not true gelato but it was seriously delicious after our meal we were waiting for quite a while while our server and the piano player chatted finally the player pointed out i was staring our guy down and he brought the check for a 60 meal at best the place itself is very cute and enjoyable the service and food is nothing to boast about we will not be going back
  this somewhat out of the way restaurant is well worth at least one weekend afternoon visit even if you re on bus from town i see there has been some disappointment registered regarding the evening i can t comment as i ve only done the afternoon several times but i would i will go again booking at the weekend is advised imperial palace is definitely one of the best dim sum places in edinburgh it s best experienced in as large a group of dedicated dim sum fans as you can muster while a point is lost for occasional stodginess it s a large busy place with a penchant for steaming you can go all out here with your sweet and savoury baus lemon tarts siu mai har gau chicken s feet if you dare and great duck and char siu the works matthew s chinese supermarket beside is also fantastic if you consider yourself a fan of chinese food this is an edinburgh must even if you end up thinking it s not worth the journey 30 40 minutes on bus from town you ve got to go and try it go fill your bags with chinese groceries and reward the work with a dim sum feast
  excellent and friendly staff the food is terrific as well if your looking for mexican food near sahara and decatur don t pass this place up
  this checkers location recently opened up on the corner of jones and tropicana in the smith s shopping center i ve never been to checkers the food was decent for fast food and the prices were low i wasn t too excited about this location but it s good to have a little more diversity in the area for junk food
  awesome food and great atmosphere been here about 5 times within last year and it s always been a pleasure
  good food better service nice recommendations by my server make sure you get steve or jessica she s hot
  food was ok more mex than tex my wife tried the hot sauce and from the face she made i didn t touch it too vinegary food was ok ambiance was 10 tables in a store for fast food ok for a nice texmex dinner look else where
  great place in the roosevelt neighborhood the savory crepes and italian soda were delicious excited to go back for a sweet crepe next time
  omg the beer band and crowd are amazing when we go to vegas we have to go there real german beer and bands both imported from munich i usually just eat a snack the obazter cheese spread w big pretzel but all my kids eat the food and it is good a bit pricey but so worth it to us i think everyone should go here once now me and my kids want to go to munich
  omg did you know that light fixture on top of the ceiling is gordon ramsay s hand movements while he makes the famous beef wellington i m being sarcastic i guess it s a creative piece of art but seems somewhat too abstract to awe at when the hostess pointed it out before we sat down i think she expected us to look up and be amazed at his delicate intentional hand movements to procure his famous beef wellington anyway we went with the foie gras for an appetizer the american cap and the beef wellington foie gras will always be good was happy to have it since it was banned in the state of california a couple years ago the american cap was juicy fatty and tasty highly recommended the beef wellington was good but nothing life changing i mean with those hand movements outlined on the ceiling light fixture i should ve better appreciate the countless hours mr ramsay spent to perfect his art sarcasm i otherwise had a really good experience here and had fun laughing at gordon ramsay s hand movement light fixture service was excellent and everything was elegant from the placemats to the uniforms of the wait staff i highly recommend checking this place out for an extraordinary dinner
  pretty cool place bar pool and foosball and dancing for the ladies the price was a little expensive but it was nice playing pool with my buddies while the girls were off dancing across the room i would go again for sure
  looking at other reviews it looks like this nathan s is unique in its grossness we went there for breakfast on our last day in vegas as we didn t want to spend time going to another hotel the line at mcdonald s was long and there was nobody at nathan s now i know why the express breakfast which is the only breakfast option is 8 or 9 the food was horrible and greasy my wife was literally gagging trying to choke down her food and ended up just eating the soft moist toast i m a bigger eater than her and even i was having trouble just disgusting the food on my plane ride here was much better if you re trying to decide between the two go for mcdonald s
  love the smiley faces at the entrance also the food variety if you had to choose foods between this and old country i d go with this both good though loved the desert placr and the chocolate fountain
  okay i had them at four stars due to liking some things but missing some of the mucho gusto items but they have shifted still new items but some of the favorites from mucho gusto are back on the menu like the gaucho steak and the chiles rellenos i went with some friends from work after a training and we played cards against humanities they have several card and board games over drinks and dinner i also noticed the price point on items has come down as well so the cost is more in line with what it used to be i think this is a good example of an eatery trying something new and then shifting back a bit to incorporate things that people missed but still having new items like the selection of cocktails and the larger wine list on thursday night they also had live acoustic music which was wonderful i have to say i m much more inclined to start coming back to revival on a regular basis after this experience and they were quite busy on thursday night so i hope they are doing well
  food is pretty good but it s a little greasy that being saif you should be here for the brew mostly anyway very nice vibe inside true sports pub feel friendly staff and huge portions we have plenty left over for dinner we used an entertainment coupon no problemo we will be back it s a cool hangout can t wait for football season plenty of flat screens wherever you are in the pub
  i ve been here a couple of times my thoughts my boss introduced me to this place and i thought it was okay no complaints whatsoever but didn t think it was that great either but i thought i would go back again but that was then this is now a friend from reno moved to lv to study and she said she misses her pho back home so i said i ll take her to a good place so i took her here she ordered exactly what she would order in reno but boy was she disappointed when she tried her order i didn t really know what the difference was compared to what she was used to but i guess it was really that bad since after having only 3 spoonfuls she gave up to the point that she decided she didn t want to finish her food i felt embarrassed because on our way there i was prepping her to look forward to some awesome pho but the only thing that she had was disappointment
  been here a couple of times got the omekase dinner both times straight good almost too much food for both myself and my wife to finish the flavors of the sushi sashimi are excellent the drinks are great the atmosphere is cool we ll definitely be back again i m sure
  this was a really pleasant surprise the normal friday night ritual erupted last night and that is finding a restaurant interesting enough for me and flexible enough for the lady s particular tastes she was going to be nice enough to go to dish although i know it s not one of her favs mantini s also came across the radar screen however i wanted to try somewhere new and we both wanted to try something budget friendly annie s mom gave us an entertainment book for christmas and papa j s was listed as an option i checked out the website and was less than enthusiastic unlike its sister restaurant in carnegie this spot has a stripped down menu i m guessing because it does most of its business during lunch hours and maybe happy hour i called the restaurant and they did have many options not on the internet menu including a couple feature dishes note to restaurant please update your website you don t even list any pasta dishes as an option for the downtown location we decided to check it out after calling her brother lee who goes often we get there around 730 pm last night friday upon entering the extremely old classic building i m struck by the interior which is truly old school it s dark wood exposed brick ornate lighting and the like there are a group of regulars i d guess sitting at the bar imbibing loudly the bartender notices us and asks if we need a table for two we are then greeted by a friendly gal jj who takes us to the back dining room which is a bit crowded and she senses our hesitation and takes us to the other side of the bar which only has a few patrons annie confirms with jj that we can use the entertainment card she confirms and we save 12 bucks she brings us over some decent bread unfortunately not served warm the bread is served along with the obligatory oil and vinegar mix she left a big bowl of parmesan cheese for us to add as much as we wanted which was a nice touch annie started with the wedding soup which was okay but not memorable i tried the potato soup which was pretty tasty although a little bland annie then ordered the chicken romano which was really good the chicken wasn t too eggy and the coating was almost light which is hard to accomplish with this dish in addition the portion size was pretty large and the chicken was cooked perfectly and not dry at all they also accommodated her request to have thin spaghetti for the pasta and serve with alfredo sauce which they did for a dollar more the whole dish i think was 15 i ordered the salmon with green beans it was a reasonable portion of fish cooked well the green beans were crisp and fresh the salmon was served on a chipotle pesto i found the pesto a bit overpowering and could have skipped it altogether but if it did need to be served on pesto i would have preferred a traditional style pesto service was spot on from start to finish i think jj s family owns the restaurant we inquired about the rumors of the place being haunted and the former incarnations of this place being a brothel jj took us down to the basement and showed us the underground tunnels that used to be used for the local politicians to make their way to the brothel unnoticed she also took us upstairs and showed us the madame s bedroom incidentally the headboard of the madame s bed is now the bar downstairs i took a picture and posted the whole meal with a couple of martinis was only 45 after the entertainment card discount not including tip and we both had leftovers we stopped at the bar for a nightcap after dinner and the bartender said they are redesigning the menu and trying hard to make this more of a dinner spot than just happy hour there was also a band setting up as we left it seems like they are trying hard and i intend to be back however be warned if you re looking for a hip happening spot a la tamari this probably isn t it but if you re looking for decent 3 star food great value and service you could do a lot worse i ll be back
  it s open 24 hours and serves ok mexican food not anything to write home about but hits the spot when you are cruising late night for a meal i find that there food is on the greasier side and usually my stomach can t handle that they do have some specials during the week that make cheap meals for the family prefer rivas mexican grill which is around the corner
  pretty good place with great appetizers and entrees that you will probably be to full to eat by the time you eat your apps and bread i have nothing bad to say about it but for some reason nothing really draws me into this place
  we love the hub we used to drive 30 minutes to eat there but recently moved closer wings burgers onion rings everything is delicious and the staff is always friendly and helpful
  midwood smokehouse is a welcome addition to the charlotte bbq scene located in the ever burgeoning plaza midwood neighborhood midwood delivers on the q while at the same time adding modern flair with dishes like smoked vegetable bruschetta smoked turkey and sausage and a cuban sandwich the pork bbq was smoky and delicious and i love that they have 4 sauce options to choose from the mac cheese was a standout side and the hush puppies were tasty too i look forward to going back to try the ribs the pimento cheese fries and the desserts
  only went here on st patricks day because of the event on the linq tried the irish special 9 hotdog there was nothing unique or tasty about the hotdog i was very disappointed paying 9 for a bland hotdog that didn t stand out to me interior was nice but defiantly won t be coming back
  attended the soft opening here this week and it was well worth it the location is great and the decor and atmosphere was causal and laid back newly remodeled with tvs everywhere on the 2nd level any sports you want to see i am sure they have it here for you too watch the food was great and our server was attentive and very helpful can t wait to come back especially once football season kicks off
  i enjoy coming to this location because it is never super busy and the customer service is great the staff is very friendly and the food is terrific since the temperatures are semi dropping i do like that they have an outdoor patio because it s great to enjoy the evening weather the bathrooms are always clean
  got hungry for a taco while driving back from the covalent surfboard factory by the mesa gateway airport yelp suggested rudy s i tried and loved the california burrito which is terrific carne asada with potatoes peppers and other stuff i had them roll it with the red hot sauce already in to make it easier to eat on the go rudy had a steady flow of customers while i was there mid afternoon so must be popular with locals fairly nice inside for a taqueria looks like it was a new take out pizza place that went out of business and then rudy took it over i m sure this is a huge improvement over the previous tenant
  in my final meal in pittsburgh i finally had the closest thing to a pittsburgh sandwich and that was the big ben hot dog with cole slaw fries and a cheese sauce it oddly worked and i enjoyed the meal before i had to hit the road the fries our table shared was also a winner as they were crispy and uniformly cut and fluffy potato goodness in the middle definitely a great cheap eats spot
  i love grimaldi s pizza it still amazes too think it all started with the one location all the way in henderson for me opposite side of town and now they have multiple locations all over the valley so whenever have my itch for think crust pizza always grimaldi close by it was my first time at this particular location the food it was par with all the other grimaldi s the perfect think crust love the sauce and love the toppings am two topping type of pizza lover only because feel with this style of pizza only way too go because love the crust less is better the fresh buffalo mozzarella not but loving there pizza awesome like always the service our server was very friendly never had empty glass and management was very much present checking up on us it smaller location compare too two other locations been too i always fan of the decor with the brick style walls the red and white checkerboard table cloth the simplicity of the menu and the empty win bottle for lights the old rat pack style of music playing in the restaurant or specifically frankie sinatra it nice that now there so many options in fashion show mall not just food court
  semi hole in the wall restaurant in chinatown service was good probably because we were the only ones there at the time mo worries three other fame came in when we were there crab cakes were a little salty but still good husband didn t like his potatoes but eggs were delish over good for off the strip breakfast
  i vebtried just about everything and it is always delicious best burger s ever ever the pineapple ketchup is amazing as well even their milkshakes are like no other just go order one of everything and prepare for the best week of your life d
  love hana sushi try the mars roll and the arizona roll you won t be disappointed the sitting area is small but intimate the staff is always friendly they have non sushi items available as well calamari beef bowls etc
  bww you get wings and you re happy great for watching sports i get the parm garlic and salt vinegar traditional wings ranch love this place
  amazing all i can say is fresh the menu is in the smaller side which ensures that everything is made fresh everyday soups sandwiches bread pastries breakfast sandwiches coffee all awesome i have tried almost everything on the menu and would order any of it again favorite baguette in town and extremely reasonably priced
  this is the first time eating here but it was amazing we told them it was our first time and we got a free appetizer and a coupon for another one the food was all very tasty the waitress made great recommendations and our 3 year old enjoyed all the dipping sauces we will be back for sure
  this place is okay we didn t wait long for a table but we did wait to get our drink order taken and then about 20 minutes for our food which was one crepe and one cinnamon waffle our waitress was busy i guess because she didn t seem to check on us often and she didn t really speak up which she needed to do because that place is loud i got my waffle and wanted a steak knife to cut through it i remember going to a waffle place that had waffles like these before and they were done in 5 minutes and i didn t need a sharp knife to cut through them so this waffle wasn t my favorite waffle on my list of favorite waffles it comes in right under that weird store brand frozen waffle i bought one time because there was a picture of a meadow on the box in retrospect what does a meadow have to do with waffles i don t know my friend didn t like the coffee but my frozen mocha smoothie was pretty alright he got a gyro crepe and said it was basically a salad stuffed into a crepe the potatoes au gratin were pretty good though one thing i didn t like was the lack of sides you could order i figure you can order sides but it would have been nice to see what was available instead of having to rely on the soft spoken waitress who i could not hear
  excellent meal from the start this was something special the warm bread with the warm cilantro oil to dip it in awesome bone in rib eye was done so damn right creamed corn with candied carrots are perfect sides and the sides are really large a dozen oysters to start they were baby size oysters smallest i ve ever had but good and fresh wait staff was top notch every need was met immediately this is a rare meal that i couldn t eat dessert i was full after the entree this is vegas top grossing restaurant its not to pricey in my opinion well worth every penny
  i love pho this place has pho that hits the spot i ve been here multiple times excellent fried spring rolls food s always hot and fresh and the service is great the rest of the food is okay they do use msg in their chicken stock fyi wonton noodle soup didn t have real wonton noodles so will not be reordering that particular dish
  we love the peppermill quick service great food large portions and we love the amazing staff we were greeted by larz the host whom which we believe should be promoted to manager and tells us there appetizers are gangster we had a shy but willing to take one for the team server yancyyyy who we convinced to pose in our complimentary group photo we love mary the manager she coo too maryyyyy we will see you tonight go to the peppermill and get your experience
  my friends and i came here for dinner while in vegas and actually had a decent time i m generally hesitant when headed to a corporate chain restaurant in fear of an over priced and mediocre meal i guess aaron sanchez is the chef here honestly the food was pretty decent our meals ranged from mac n cheese to the chicken sandwich ribs and jumbalaya all was thoroughly enjoyed and savored they didn t have live music playing when we were there but they did have music playing in the background the vibe is pretty modern upbeat and fun not bad i was pretty impressed
  first time here did not have tapas but the cubano sandwich for lunch it was good not great sweet tater fries were good didn t love the yogurt dip that accopmanies them service was good and the decor was unique kinda of like the office former tenant of this space but dressed up for a night out the cubano won t bring me back but i ll go again to give the tapas a shot
  i recently went to nakama for the first time for a first date many firsts that night starting with the bad we made dinner reservation for 7 15 and were a few minutes late we were told that we lost our spot and had the choices to either wait a half hour to 45 minutes sit at the sushi bar or just order food at a table without the hibachi experience we opted to get a drink at the bar and wait it out this was a wednesday evening and the place was packed no seats available at first so we checked out the drink menu and finally we got a couple of chairs the drinks were decent i m a lightweight so they were good for me it worked out that we waited for the hibachi because we were able to be squeezed in within ten minutes i got hibachi seasame chicken and my date got nakama tuna steak he also ordered sushi but our waiter had forgotten to bring it it was really no problem because the portion sizes are pretty big and we probably couldn t have ate the sushi anyways i have no complaints about my chicken it definitely exceeded my expectations based on the other reviews i have seen for it my date goes there on the regular and so his tuna steak obviously has his coming back for more the onion soup was by far one of the better japanese soups i have had it has a kick to it that i haven t tasted anywhere else our hibachi chef was wonderful he was entertaining easy to talk to and was really good at his job he even let us all try a little fried rice i always have had reservations about nakama because i thought it was an overexposed restaurant that jacked its prices up because of its trendy reputation i really enjoyed my time there it was clean and had a lot of energy i ll be back again
  the food here is amazing everything we had here was good our waiter was good too why the 3 stars first star lost for the 30 minute wait even if we made a reservation 2nd star lost for crappy hostess no idea what they are doing ask me to wait at the bar but not around to take my drink order also don t know how to transfer my drinks to the table i get better service in at mcdonalds
  yup super good highly recommend the sexy roll good roll great sauce late night happy hour for late night revellers buy one get one for all alcohol from midnight to 4am sun thru thursday
  i had some of the best ahi tuna i have experience in a long time rare actually did mean rare i am glad to see that their cooks have been trained in the are of tuna searing the tamari tuna is basically a sesame crusted seared tuna on a bed of rice and veggies with a great chile sauce think of it as an upscale jap mex fusion the tuna itself was of a very high grade sliced thinly and a dark ruby red it was tender and lacked the sinuous bits cheaper ahi can have the flavor was fresh and well accompanied by the tamari crusted sesame seeds i also had a small salad with their sesamee ginger dressing which is so good that i would order in cocktails if it were not frowned upon there was also a copious amount of corn bread so i could get my south western starch fix
  went in for an early dinner on a tuesday i had a groupon for a value of 40 i ordered and presented the voucher and was shortly thereafter informed they would only honor it for 30 they claimed it was some sort of glitch by groupon while their food wine my service were outstanding i was only one of 2 tables occupied in the entire restaurant what a stupid way to disenfranchise a guest especially one who has dined there previously as i live in the immediate area i certainly enjoy helping an establishment by dining there through the lean summer months but that s just horrible business acumen guess i ll go to some of the other restaurants in kierland next time
  yes yes yes yes yes i love this place crazy delicious food amazingly friendly service and their ingredients are pretty good some local etc i wish they were open all day because it can be difficult to get out of bed early enough to come here but it s totally worth it when i do
  ordered a pizza and wings on friday night used the online app that said it would be delivered in 30 40 minutes an hour and a half later i called to cancel the order when the driver knocked in the door i told the manager that an hour wait over the quoted time was unacceptable and he said well it is friday night not my problem staff up if you know it s going to be busy let s see if the email for a free pizza ever shows up
  we my uberyelper husband jim w and i ate dinner here long ago with fellow yelpers heather and ryan c i am truly remiss in my review writing it seems i m giving them four stars but it s not an easy four in fact i think they re benefiting from the quality of the company we had a great time we always have a great time with these particular yelpers so in some ways that benefits the restaurant because we re already happy but i digress we all agreed that dessert was the high point of the meal their tiramisu makes my top five list of best tiramisu s ever dinner wasn t as big a hit chicken parm one of my favorite things ever was merely average though i can t remember what everyone else ordered average seemed to be the feeling all around the place was lovely and the service was good i doubt we ll go there again because we moved to la in the time it took me to get to this particular review but if heather and ryan want to meet there for dessert i might just make the drive
  my husband and i live in the area near this bar and have passed by it at least 100 times we were always so skeptical because of the area there are a few really great hidden eateries in lv but most of them we ve heard by word of mouth last night we decided to give elements its first chance upon entering we were greeted by almost everyone in the restaurant the restaurant is amazingly decorated inside there were a few people eating at the bar and a few in the dining room and it was just perfect the lights were dim and the ambiance was just right for our date night out we immediately sat down and were served this amazing baked french bread and kalamata bread that our waiter informed us that was baked in house by the chef himself it was served with a side of butter and house made chutney that was out of this world are you hungry yet we spoke with our knowledgeable waiter peter for quite some time about the menu and how it changes frequently he suggested the proscuitto wrapped jumbo shrimp and the bruschetta which were both amazing the only disappointment there s never enough we each ordered a drink off their extensive martini menu which boasts over 300 custom martinis yes 300 and they are all alphabetized and described to suit your needs after another round of bread we were still chatting it up with our waiter when catherine the owner came over to introduce herself and talk about the menu she informed us of some of the specials for the night and told us that her husband luis is the only solo cook in the restaurant he s argentinian and very passionate about food which we were starting to understand we both ordered the house salad with home made gorganzola cheese dressing as our main course my husband ordered the sea bass and i ordered the special veal scaloppine first the presentation of these meals were amazing they were plated so beautifully it was a pleasant surprise to have something this amazing not on the strip and without the chaos both were served with an amazing mashed potato which changes frequently and vegetables that were prepared divinely they both came with reduction sauces that beautifully complemented each dish i m not a big fish eater but the sea bass was encrusted with black peppercorns and just melted in your mouth almost by the end of our main course the dining room was empty and basically the restaurant had closed they close at 9 30 but continued to treat us like family all the way through dessert by this time we had met the head chef and owner luis who had personally come out to introduce himself this allowed us to gush over his meals which i think he enjoyed last course dessert a specialty by catherine she hand makes all of the desserts herself in the restaurant that s right everything is made in house we tried the butterscotch bread pudding which was completely amazing it was warm gooey and like a slice of heaven it was beautifully prepared and a complete pleasure to eat catherine had also brought out a sample of her truffles and a piece of cheesecake to go for breakfast after dessert luis and catherine sat at the bar and chatted with us for a little while when we again expressed how wonderful our experience was it has definitely become a place we will go to more often and bring along friends and family just another reason why you should never judge a book by it s cover thank you for a very memorable meal that has been added to our top 5 list
  almost always delicious locally grown offerings with only two downsides relatively small portions for the price and uneven service staff is always very friendly and accommodating when they re around all in all it is moving in the right direction since opening but the bang for the buck quotient needs to improve a bit
  oh taco guild i bitterly resent having to give you a single star pretty much everything is a disaster from high top stools designed by torquemada to the brazenly over priced drinks fetched by surly independently wealthy cocktail servers our server looked like a lumberjack yet acted like serge from beverly hills cop i had two tacos torn lettuce cups what i got was half a head of wet butter lettuce with a neat tablespoon of sodium soaked protein in the middle the pork adobo was indistinguishable from the coffee braised brisket truly stunning for 3 95 each i have eaten more satisfying fare out of an mre packet it is loud inside which amplifies the horrific choice to put a jukebox in a restaurant there is a ton of service staff none of which will make eye contact with a patron begging for a drink the chips were fresh and crunchy and the salsas offered were not bad perhaps that merits the single star i was forced to give
  i don t even normally like philly cheese steaks but the sandwiches here are amazing they put cheez whiz on them what i know sounds completely revolting right turns out it isn t i though cheez whiz was e z cheez nope it is something completely different combine that with the grilled onions and perfectly grilled steak chunks hello taste bud meltdown experience and the cheez whiz fries with grilled onions holy mother of god are those goooood i don t even want to take a guess on what the caloric intake is on either but if you don t care or only want to eat once that week anyway take a trip to corleone s you won t regret it well you may if you don t wear your stretchy pants when you go
  trying to figure out where to eat for lunch during week takes creativity after realizing i never tried mr k s which supposedly is a staple in charlotte i decided to make a quick pit stop last week it s good to know their air conditioner works well cold air blasting in the tiny joint looking at the menu board all i could think of is damn this is not cheap 4 for just a cheeseburger oh well too late to leave now so i tried the homestyle cheeseburger carolina style 0 50 for the chili and an order of fries another 1 90 i asked the nice lady what s the difference between homestyle and non homestyle and she said it s seasoned and made from scratch but should all burgers be seasoned final verdict it tasted ok nothing out of the worldly awesome fries were just frozen fries for almost 7 i would have wanted more
  great healthy place to go if you are in a hurry service is quick and food is great can t go wrong with the lentil soup any of the salads and the hummus is very good
  this is a real let down of a steakhouse are they even serving prime beef i really hope so but can t tell from their steaks that being said their kobe burger is pretty good for lunch and you can get sushi as your side talk about a decadent vegas lunch it s my signature
  a disappointment for me it s not even about the argument for authentic mexican food or whatever this restaurant offers poor service a number of cold and oily dishes at an unreasonable price and watery drinks a waste if the restaurant is framed around this fancy tequila library they re so proud of i was in a medium sized party seeking to get some drinks we were a maybe on food none of us had planned to eat full meals when we asked for a table we were told that tables had to be saved for customers eating dinner ok totally fair when you re slammed with reservations and have a line out the door but this was a sunday evening before the dinner rush and the place wasn t even half full we really had to insist before the manager signaled to the hostess that we could be seated so we get to looking at the menus and things look interesting despite the high prices we end up ordering food after all i decide on the special tacos gross another commenter mentioned pork tacos filled with big chunks of awful overcooked rubberized things that was exactly what i was served these chewy pork nuggets were piled on top of what i was told were going to be crispy taco shells in actuality oil soaked corn tortillas and topped with some weird applesauce like chutney that was so sickly sweet i couldn t bear it on top of all of that my dish was barely warm no wait on top of all that my dish was 14 you can get good juicy spicy hot pork tacos in town for three bucks paired with a measly 5 oz cocktail that cost 10 and had a giant thumb shaped lemon zest garnish in it a total scam if a cocktail costs 10 you invest a little time in the garnishes the temperature of the glass other little details all the mentions of slow service in other reviews are true like another commenter we sat around with our plates all sad and dirty for 20 minutes before our table was cleared just gross a yuppie scam
  i really wanted to give them 5 stars but both times i have been there the hostess gave off a seriously bad vibe what s funny though is that both servers were so nice and did a really great job maybe this is their technique the food is very tasty i had the halibut and my fiance had the tenderloin the tenderloin was better but for being in the middle of the country the halibut was pretty damn good also both had terrific sauces that really made the dish kudos to the chef i also had the steamed clams with chorizo as an appetizer that turned out to be a real winner the residual sauce at the bottom of the bowl was perfect for dipping we avoided dessert this time but last time had the cheese plate the cheese s were all wisconsin cheese s big surprise and were all excellent i saw their desserts at another table and while i was happy with the cheese plate realized i would not have gone wrong getting the other instead besides the massive calorie infusion the interior of the restaurant is pretty classy and comfortable but on a nice night grab a seat outside with a view of the square that is the way to go props also for the excellent wine selection they had a long list of pi not noirs with many of them out of oregon that means their sommelier knows his business
  came with a group and had a great lunch lots of food and i m stuffed i ordered the manhandler aka chopped pork and sausage good sandwich but in my mind i had something else planned i guess service was great and food was timely i will come back but will try a different sandwich ps change the name of the sandwich
  we recently moved to this side of town and were hopeful that umai would be our new go to spot for sushi having been spoiled like crazy by the wonderful sushi and value at new zealand on monroe and still saddened by the closing of mai sushi at colony rea we ventured down to quail corners in search of our new neighborhood spot while the atmosphere is great the food was not our cup of tea we started with an order of edamame which is difficult to mess up but the beans were clearly not fresh they tasted like they had been frozen too long because the texture was mealy and the pods were wimpy move on to the sushi order a couple of sake salmon nigiri and a spicy tuna hand roll well it was all okay the fish was fine but nothing special it was all pretty much tasteless in fact i think the sushi i ve picked up from the fridge in harris teeter was tastier and half the price i mean i would eat it if i were really desperate for sushi but considering how close we are to southpark park road shopping center etc and the fact that umai s prices are pretty steep for what you get i would definitely head in another direction the next time i crave sushi now let s talk noodles for a second because my son is pretty much a ramen afficionado he is only 12 but has been eating ramen noodles since he could eat solid foods not the kind that come out of the wrapper he has an amazing palate and he certainly does know good ramen and this was the worst he s ever tasted according to him the broth was just wrong i tasted it too like maybe they added some miso then boiled it which is a huge no no or maybe the broth had been revived from the day before one too many times i have no idea but all i know is that we re not fans the ramen noodles had pork as the protein and the texture was tough and inedible i ve never seen my son leave a bowl of noodles uneaten but despite our best efforts to salvage it with a touch of soy sauce and some sriaracha we just had to let it go just for full disclosure i did order a seafood stir fry dish carry out for my husband and he ate every last bite but he s not really that picky and he was really hungry the dish was 18 so it should have been way better than good in my opinion it didn t look any better than the seafood dish we ve ordered from chi thai in arboretum harris teeter for years and years and was much more expensive anyway i ve had better in charlotte if you like authentic tastes and textures of japanese food you are probably better to steer clear of umai
  they took over 30 minutes to prepare our food i asked for my meal to be well done crispy they brought my entree out and it was as soft and white as a baby s behind i sent it back the dish came back darker but not crispy andfrustrated i gave up my family on the other hand enjoyed their entrees a sub and a fried food platter
  seabass w risotto amazing it might be the best seabass i ve had in my life kobe sliders okay i thought they would be better filet mignon i didn t taste it but my girlfriends said it was good but slightly overcooked side of asparagus asparagus were a tad overcooked but the sauce that accompanied them was mindblowing the service at fix was impeccable they were very attentive and made sure that we were very satisfied with our meal
  service was disorganized and extremely slow they made up for it with free drinks and ice cream but we were left with a bad taste in out moths mouth when the manager insulted me to my face and proceeded to talk about inappropriate things on the way out of the restaurant i won t be going back here
  fantastic food and service i came last weekend and it was packed the next time i come will be strategically planned around the rush hours
  first time having puerto rican food and absolutely loved this place family owned and operated and they go out of their way to make an enjoyable experience not a dine in place but they have tables set up outside and will be fun for take out would recommend to anyone loved everything but my favorite was the empanadas meat pie and coconut drink definitely worth trying
  my husband and i celebrated our anniversary with a fabulous meal our servers jeff and dan were incredibly friendly and the level of attention just right the food was cooked to perfection sure it s pricey but it was meant to be an experience not just dinner and they delivered
  oh pittsburgh oh man mixology is kind of old hat at this point you really need to be at the top of your game when you do this because there are really goo places out there for this most of this place looks to be patronized by people who look around as if they have never been in a nice bar before bros in one corner chanting at one another round out the patronage experience in was that i can describe as creepy we were given to seats at the bar where someone has just left the bartender did not 1 wipe down the bar 2 greet us 3 provide us with menus and water if you guys cant get past this basic service just stop i don t know what standards are being used around here for what is good this is not it oh and if you really want to throw tacos into the mix which you are ripping off from one of your coworkers going to chicago and eating with the natives at big star http bigstarchicago com do it way better than you are now
  the other day at gymnastics the teacher asked all the kids about their favorite restaurants every kid said mcdonalds until mine they both answered souper salad it is a less fancy sweet tomatoes and their soups are not nearly as good but the price is unbeatable they have regular coupons and on wednesdays kids eat for 2 the salad bar is pretty good and even has options that sweet tomatoes does not like cottage cheese the salad bar is always clean and stocked the staff is always polite friendly and remove our dishes promptly the pizza runs out often but lately it has been replaced very timely my daughter loves their pizza they also sometimes have steamed broccoli with cheese which is great for getting kids to eat vegetables for dessert they offer pound cake and strawberries for strawberry shortcake topped with soft serve ice cream for 6 the average coupon price you walk out of there very full content and with happy kids
  since there were so many complaints about slow delivery i decided to be a reasonable person and order delivery i ordered online had my pizza in about 40 minutes which since they make cook it when you order it that is totally reasonable to me however prettttttttty sure they gave me a size smaller than what i ordered but not 100 positive i was too hungry to bust out the ruler
  this review is for breakfast only unbelievably bad breakfast wobbly table bad service had to ask for salt pepper napkin and silverware cream for coffee was old and curdled sausage was disgusting eggs not the way i ordered them coffee lousy too i recommend you eat anywhere but here for breakfast seemed like cafeteria food
  this place looks like a total hole in the wall but it is really good everything seemed so fresh and made to order the salsa varieties were excellent and quantities are large enough for two meals
  yuck the food was terrible the crowd was awful i would never go back here the end
  love this place the food is excellent and so is the service i highly recommend it the staff and manager are very friendly too
  we arrived late 9 45 10pm for dinner on a friday night we each ordered the red sangria which was great then the empanadas to start which my husband who is from argentina thought were below average having lived in argentina a k a the land of empanadas for 3 years i ve had the best empanadas you can imagine the ones i had at alma didn t even come close to the better ones i ve had in nyc or even the ones i ve made myself at home to be fair on the menu it indicated the empanadas were chilean there are many versions of empanadas depending on which latin south american country you go to so ill give them some slack i haven t had empanadas from chile before so maybe i m comparing unfairly i will say however the empanadas were served lukewarm which is a no no they should always be served piping hot i also ordered the arugula salad with mango almonds and cilantro it was way too salty although the arugula was very fresh my main dish i ordered the arepa with veggies and platanos it was so so it had a lot of different flavors but i didn t feel like any of the flavor was fluid across the dish i don t know how to really explain it my husband s dish he had the brisket with rice he really liked his dish the meat was tender and flavorful he gave his main dish 3 5 5 stars since we arrived late we opted not to order dessert since they were closing we could hear them vacuuming while we were eating overall i d give our experience 3 5 stars if it had cost more i would given it fewer stars although the food wasn t the best it was relatively cheap and ingredients were fresh probably wouldn t go back until i ve had the chance to try other latin american south american options in pittsburgh to compare it to i hear seviche in the cultural district has great food
  driving down 5th windows down music bumpin on my way to class stopped at a red i pulled up yelp to see where i could pop in and get some grilled chicken quickly this place catches my yelp eye so i turn on oakland and spot it i noticed its tucked in next to a chinese spot oh decisions skipped the chinese and went w my initial plan i m unsure if i ve ever tried turkish food but boy oh boy this is delicious the spices the seasoning the size of the helping the service the price the taste the healthier option all made me extremely happy i went for the chicken shish kebabs which came with tomato pepper onion lettuce cabbage bread and tahikihi sauce simple prep and absolutely flavorful i m lovin this place
  my review is for my experience on 04 26 13 i was in phoenix to celebrate my 50th birthday in my birth town and decided to have lunch at alice cooper stown overall i had an awesome experience i like how the women get into the theme with cutoff denim shorts black tanks and tees and ac eye makeup everyone i encountered was friendly and helpful but i want to make a special shout out to susie she took outstanding care of me i decided to go with the tuna casserole based on her suggestion recommendation it was wonderful creamy great flavor not fishy smelling or tasting onion rings would have been a great side hint hint i wasn t familiar with kilt lifter and she gave me a sample with my hefe it was so good i had two full glasses susie was attentive without being overbearing and invited me to walk around to check out the memorabilia good waitress bartender she is she gave me a covered cup of water to keep me hydrated i especially liked the decor a combination of music and sports memorabilia with lots of alice cooper influence the music totally rocked the restaurant also has a nice selection of tshirts and sweatshirts for sale maybe a bit overpriced but hey they re in business to make money here s a tip go at lunch i m sure the dinner crowd is exactly that a crowd next time i m in phoenix i m definitely going back thanks susie for taking care of me
  i ve since been back multiple times and have been happy each time love their bbq burrito and their waffle fries
  stopped in tonight it s the day after christmas and i am not the only one in the area sick of the christmas feast i walked in to find a very busy restaurant but service was still good there were many people working hard never skipping a beat it seemed i ordered cashew chicken and sweet and sour shrimp with fried rice pretty delicious the shrimp were a good size and the cashew chicken was a huge portion good flavor and well worth the wait i will definitely be trying this place again
  good but not great see and be seen joint with a pretentious attitude regarding their vibe food frankly after all the raves and top tens i expected more blueberry pancakes good bacon very good eggs runny ordered over medium fresh fruit very good while eating our breakfast my wife and i were lamenting that we didn t go back to the daily dose one block down again the bc was good but just good live and learn
  terrible bar smells like a dirty locker room the bar tenders are rude the drinks are terrible and when you ask for a new one they call you a drunk and argue with you about it bathrooms are the most disgusting room i have ever been in if you go there do not use them only good thing is that music isn t overly loud
  i loved our server we asked her about a few things off the menu and gave us her honest opinions our wings were great and beer was cold
  we have been going to this place since it opened and we love it the menu is good and they will bend over backward to accomodate you it is not fancy but it is good the portions are big and the service is friendly we live close by but we still have to drive so we could go anywhere when they first opened my husband asked for scotch which they didn t have the next time we went int hey had his chivas and he is happy also the food is always tasty not just a protein thrown in sauce and served this food is flavorful and well spiced
  i ve been to vitos about 4 5 times i live 45 mins away totally worth the drive the bread and zucchini are my fav way to start my meal don t eat too much because the food is going to make u so full the deep dish pizza is to die for i admit to being a food snob i believe in using good ingredients and creating flavors that you can t get in every other pizza shop vitos is king they make their own sausage sooo good and their sauce isn t too sweet from the basil their crust has some sweetness to it it is not over powering or distracting to the food the sweetness creates a balance to the overall pizza the texture is perfect i m making myself hungry really this place is a big surprise you will love it fyi byob if u want soda or iced tea they got u covered
  i have been to emilianos 3 5 times over the past several years the service food and margaritas have always been ok or good never terrible or great i dined here most recently on friday night with friends and ordered a margarita and chicken quesadilla the margarita was all right but i believe that mad mex serves up a much tastier margarita the chicken quesadilla was pretty tasty though i personally prefer slices of chicken to the shredded chicken in these quesadillas our waiter was nice enough but could have offered better service our chips and salsa were quickly eaten but never replaced and i was never offered a second margarita overall i don t dislike this restaurant but would select to dine at a mad mex instead any day
  fantastic you can t get any more food for these prices it is open 24 hours yet it is very clean breakfast food is great and service is fast
  definitely worth the wait worth the smoke smell that your hair and clothes will carry after said wait debateable but you re in vegas and that does come with the territory oysters on the half shell were good not stupendous primarily due to the varying sizes and not quite being properly shucked having the bivalve disconnected from the bottom shell is pretty standard where i grew up and the gumbo is again good but not great i think that the roux would need to be darker to garner more flavor from it and to deepen the overall taste of the gumbo but again you re in lv not nola the pan roast is everything people rave about seriously not even something small to pick at here i loved it as did my husband his second trip go to experience it at least once return to bathe yourself in the cream sauce that is the pan roast
  i love beto s having said that i acknowledge that their style of pizza is not for everybody do you love cheese do you love it so much that you want it so thick that it doesn t melt i do the sauce has chunks of tomato in it and the crust is thin and square cut it tastes like no other pizza but if you grew up eating it nothing else is as good
  well we went there today and it was actually packed because of the football game but the service was still and courteous we started of with these cornbread cakes which very good it did take some time for the food to come out but i figured it was because of all the people being a southern belle i was going to be a critic on the good because of being from mississippi it was quite good what really surprised me the most was the diplomatic solution on the take next to us from what i gathered was that the food was taking way to long and when it came out some of the order was wrong the server have her the plate with some of the wrong side dishes and got her the correct one at no charge so instead of 3 sides she got 5 also desserts was on the house for the table from working in the restaurant industry she did what she needed to make the customers happy i can t wait to go back to try a new dish the next time
  i gave this place three and not five strictly due to service and ambiance the food is delicious typical fresh organic vegan vegetarian restaurant they have some beers you normally dont see which is nice the thing i didn t like is how it takes so long to get anything also all the staff seem strait out of a comic book too hipster they all were skinny jeans deep v shirts fake glasses chomo mustaches and you can never tell who is staff and who is a customer
  we really were not going to go out for fine dining at all but we won so much money i thought it would be nice to treat my wife to another nice restaurant we had eaten at craft steak house mgm the night before and just like last time it was delish back to onda we were gambling in mirage and were hungry and decided to hit onda service amazing waiters and greeters alike were all so wonderful and very helpful my wife and i honestly felt like royalty food omg omg omg hands down one of the best meals i have ever had not in vegas but period we started out with the beef carpaccio and it was divine i had the veal for dinner and it was really good but what was amazing was my wife s osso bucco it is her absolute favorite meal and they did not disappoint at all i had several bites and it melted in your mouth omg it was to die for not to mention the portion size was rather large the price is a little on the expensive side but not too expensive compared to other fine dining in vegas
  great caribbean food certainly the best i ve had in montreal tried the oxtail knife barely necessary great flavors jerk wings were flavorful and falling apart but a bit soggy most definitely worth the trip
  two words breakfast burrito they are cheap huge yummy don t forget to ask for the red sauce to heat things up a wee bit
  we tried this place for the first time tonight it was great i had chicken lo mein and my husband had the combination fried rice the veggies in our food were super fresh i loved the lo mein it had squash mushrooms bean sprouts in it the shrimp in my husbands rice were huge overall the food was great and service was very friendly we can t wait to try the rest of the menu
  love it i had a summer salad strawberries cranberry s candied walnuts apples pears romaine spinach raspberry vinagrette and chicken omg it was so good i love this place you should go try it
  smells and tastes just like the food my burmese friends make delicious yellow curry pleasant wait staff and prompt service make this a very appealing place to eat in or take home to enjoy
  this place is great enchiladas are excellent and the prices for lunch are awesome
  i only come here for pho their pho is the best in town beef soup delicious much better than saigon s noodle staff are friendly the place is clean and spacious service is fast for pho not sure for other dishes though i ve tried pho in kim s noodle and it was far from comparable to vietbistro s now i think this really depends on the chef
  i am a sushi lover and any place that has great sushi and is ayce win the quality was great too the service that i experienced was great i went to another todai in san diego it definitely wasn t up to par with this location
  cool place to hang out and drink not a ton of seating and the downstairs is pretty small other than that the place was crowded and there was a nice patio area outside they also have cornhole which is a big plus
  we will not be back from the moment we walked in it was absolute chaos a waitress bumbed into my husband and did not apologize a man was yelling loudly into a mic what food needed to be replaced and no one greeted us for at least five minutes no one else was waiting we literally said man this food better be good it was not the sushi was completely tasteless the dumplings were so hard fried they cut my mouth the chicken was chewy it was cheap but cheap for a reason just bad buffets like this are rarely great but it is difficult i think to be this bad honestly i would not go back if it was free
  went here on saturday night with my husband and his friends and it was ok nothing amazing the food was ehhhh but they have good mozzarella sticks there are tvs everywhere so if you are a sports buff as i am not then this would be a place for you not my scene
  great food and it was fun to cook it definitely try the korean prime kalbi we got a little bit of everything my brother got the bibimbap and it was the best bibimbap we have ever had we will definitely come back
  awesome tapas had a great time on valentine s day live music and food you can t go wrong with that
  i really don t want to leave a review for blt because i love this place so much i want to keep this as my pocket list for steakhouses in vegas but i want this place to do good so it doesn t close down the food are reasonably priced and you get a discount if you have total rewards card you can also go to dinner4tonight booth for discounts off your meal on to the food popovers are to die for but don t stuff yourself with this save room for entrees the chicken pate is super delish goes great with popover of you are not butter sea salt type of person i love their butterrrrrr bone in ribeye is very flavorful and comes with bone marrow and roasted garlic in cast iron pans love their filet mignon too must try if you are a filet lover oh wait don t forget the charcuterie plate and the fresh oysters as starters overall the price the food the service are great and this place has become my new favorite steakhouse
  another tasty fun upward projects restaurant location just north of camelback and central near the other upward projects restaurants parking can be problematic at certain times though the lot to the south of windsor is large it has been full and valet also has a max sometimes i ve parked at ajs and walked up food though salad restaurants are usually yawnnn the windsor salads are vibrant interesting and flavorful i have ordered various salads and am always glad i did i enjoyed the pretzel appetizer with cheese and apples i think it came with sausage but did not eat that the drinks have always been delicious and well made service similar to the other upward projects restaurants service is excellent the servers provide the bill in a timely manner and are helpful and quick ambiance trendy hipster fun i like it
  i love this place the food is 4 stars but the view of the bellagio fountains are 5 stars i ordered the trout with string beans and my boyfriend had the sea bass special with mash potatoes and mushrooms the food came out so fast it s almost questionable how they made the food so fast but i have no complaints the fish was cooked wonderfully moist and flavorful with 2 drinks and 2 entrees the bill came out to 60 the price is pretty reasonable when you consider the breath taking view i ate my food slowly and got to enjoy the fountain show at least 5 more times
  when i asked a friend where his favorite places to get dessert were in pittsburgh one of the places he named was dinette for its chocolate pot de creme i decided to try dinner there making sure to leave room for this magical dessert i split the fritto misto lightly battered and fried slices of sweet potato fennel and onion with my dining partner in crime the lemony flavor from the salsa verde went well with the light crisp batter i ve never had fried and battered fennel before but it was good as my entree i ordered the beet greens pizza with chevre fresh mozzarella and sliced inferno peppers this was a good balance of flavors not too salty or spicy but just right the crust was just a little too thin for my tastes though i would have liked a little more chew and a little less crunch for the finale we had the chocolate pot de creme of course very rich and chocolaty definitely a solid dish but i m skeptical about it being one of the best desserts pittsburgh has to offer overall i d give this restaurant a 3 5 the service was fine but not particularly friendly or warm
  good burgers that aren t so enormous you ll have to break your jaw just to take a bite can you tell i take issue with those corporate places who serve huge burgers hoping the size will cover the fact that it s tough and under seasoned house made chips are pretty good there are a number of toppings to customize your burger quick service easy to park straight forward it s one of my go to burger joints oh and the burgers are served on delicious locally made brioche buns
  good tofu burritos are hard to come by in champaign urbana in fact the cactus grill offers the only one i know of at a restaurant in town with some nicely grilled veggies it s an independent tasty burrito joint in champaign il so of course it s not quite what you might find in arizona or california or whatever but the food is good and the folks behind the counter know how to use a tortilla
  great neighborhood pizza place the italian beef pizza and sandwich are delicious everything i have ever ordered has been fantastic wings cheese sticks subs pasta dishes they never disappoint and their delivery is fast and friendly
  food and drinks were amazing the bar even made my girlfriend s drink in a smaller size because she didn t want a goblet portions were good and dessert was great wait staff was attentive and was seated right away even though it was during a busy lunch time only issue is that the tables are too close together we felt a little crowded when eating
  no ranch that s like a deal breaker the special sauce was ok i mean everyone has a special sauce let s think of something more creative nonetheless good was fresh and fast fries were a little soggy no strong distinct flavors tasted like your average chicken fingers and fries
  i have eaten at this terrace cafe location 3 times and arranged a business dinner there last night for a group of 15 for one thing this place is so much better than the village bistro that was there before hopefully this will be the anchor restaurant that ballantyne village has been needing the food here is very good and the portions are generous enough that i alway have leftovers an oyster spinach salad i had on one visit literally had at least 20 oysters on it i ate half and took the rest home on my last visit i had a capuccino and the hummus platter the hummus was freshly made and the capuccino was delicious i have not visited the bar here but they seem to have a good selection i also did not attend the business dinner but received very good reviews from several of the attendees there is a private room there but it only holds 12 comfortably so glad to finally have a good full service place nearby
  excellently prepared cajun food set in a laid back atmosphere i love this place because it s quieter and less crowded than most of the nearby restaurants but doesn t skimp on the freshness and quality of the meal don t fool around and go straight for the bourbon fried chicken
  great for football sunday but a tad expensive
  so curious to finally visit the internationally acclaimed line of restaurants by the chef with the most michelin stars ever and instead of being disappointed by the hype like i often am i thoroughly enjoyed it cost to worth it rating 3 quite expensive but if you do the tasting menu it s on par with other fine dining michelin starred places eve award best amuse ever shot glass of foie gras parfait with parmesan foam highlights setup relaxed counter seating like at a diner but fancified version with fine dining food love the concept since i love high quality food but could do without the stuffy formal atmosphere that often comes with redefines a dinner show you re looking right into kitchen which is amazing live entertainment for a top chef watching foodie like me loved watching the precision in the process of one of the best kitchens it s crazy they aren t allowed to talk to each other which so not like you see on tv or read about in anthony bourdain with those yelling chefs different levels of menus from a small set all on one plate to a 4 course and a 10 course don t all have to do the same menu awesome option for the hub and i as most places insist on the whole party being in synch and complain about timing discrepancies etc unique presentations amuse was served on a lava rock pumpkin soup in a martini glass in a circular vase with fall accents scallop with chives never had this tender preparation before more delicate fish like texture than traditional seared style onion tart sounded so simple but was almost like a small pastry disc of a sauceless pizza with bacon and hearty mushrooms and shavings of amazing cheese sole with baby leeks light yet substantial and purely delightful hanger steak melt in your mouth with fried shallots delicately placed on top dessert quartet of tarts including snickers and passion fruit were scrumptious but the real star was the peach confit infused with moscato d asti in an apricot milkshake unexpected and refreshing sweet dish service excellent and professional easier for them to be around more with the smaller space to work all of the staff was happy to chat as well as simply present the food and disappear for a more pleasant well rounded experience wine when i inquired about a wine plan the waiter served few glasses to work well with multiple courses teppanyaki when i ve been in fine dining kitchens i don t remember seeing one of these long flat cooking areas so i found that interesting lowlights overwhelming when you see a la carte menu prices for appetizer size items around 40 go for one of the tasting menus instead they don t advertise wine pairings so i had to ask about it and they did have one to offer loved this meal best i ve had in a while with every course being fantastic i d be more than happy to return soon
  overpriced bouncers are weird play the same music over and over came here to celebrate my brothers bday our waitress was okay guys go around picking up empty bottles and cups and sometimes pick up your filled cups and bottles wth not impressed with this place
  777 special was good ordered a side salad as it doesn t come with it anymore but steak was well done and they immediately took it back and prepared a new perfectly medium rare for me otherwise i would have given 5 stars however other than the specials menu items are way overpriced such as cool looking nachos but 12 15 for chips cheese and some meat isn t worth it stick with the specials and you will enjoy your time
  free mango lassi with checkin that being said i had the lunch buffet the highlights for me were the chicken tikka masala tandoori chicken garlic nan and keer the potato pancake was interesting as well similar to what i ve had in korean cuisine but this one has a bit of sourness to it there are different types of chutney and also salad some of the vegetarian dishes were tasty as well but i m disappointed there was no paneer overall it is good service is excellent as the staff was very friendly and helpful i think we had 6 yelp checkins and they were so happy to give us our free mango lassi so much so they even gave us an extra one there is also pineapple n cantaloupe for those who like to end their meal with fresh fruit
  local review so i may be biased because of course you can find better priced meals anywhere off of the strip but it was my birthday so we decided to venture out we had the choice of having the pre chosen courses for 120 person or just decide on our own we decided to choose our own and it came to exactly the same price per person we had lemon crab arancini 19 okay but it sort of fell apart pea pesto crostini 15 good arugula salad 15 it was supposed to come with candied lemon whatever that is crispy pancetta there were maybe 3 pieces of pancetta it was basically a plate of argula and olive oil balsamic vinegar for 15 definitely not what i expected caprese salad 19 the mozzarella was very good fresh risotto 32 good very creamy and light and fluffy ravioli 36 ok surf turf 56 this is when i had to remember my italian that i took in college that plural ends in an i so when i saw raviolo instead of ravioli i thought it was strange that you only get 1 raviolo really giada so your turf is a poorly cooked piece of meat be sure to check and send it back if your medium rare comes out medium or well done and your surf is 1 raviolo stuffed with crab this was very disappointing for 56 dollars salmon 39 was okay slightly raw but i d rather have slightly raw salmon versus dry and over cooked salmon but here s the kicker it was placed ontop of lima beans and corn pretty sure the lima beans and corn came from the freezer section of my local grocer i was disappointed again maybe it s because i m a local and i could eat elsewhere or even my own kitchen for a whole lot cheaper and probably the same if not better prepared cooked food but it was an experience an experience i probably won t have again but an experience nonetheless and i m okay with that
  we had lunch here and was super solid and prices were fare for a steakhouse and for the quality of ingredients the goat cheese baklava appetizer is out of this world with shaved truffle and pistachio with drizzles of hot honey the quality of the goat cheese can not be understated small portion but extraordinary flavor the boa cobb presentation is very nice and the chop chop salad a solid starter featuring toasted pine nuts salumi and chick peas is a winner and although they no longer had the steak sandwich on the menu they used to have the waiter had the chef make it for me very nice grilled beef tenderloin on french bread with oven roasted tomatoes maytag bleu cheese and garlic mayo wow so good got bowl of fresh fruit with it instead of fries fresh quality great lunch 2 salads 1 entree size appetizer steak sandwich with side 2 sodas tax 20 tip 75 we enjoyed lunch
  i absolutely love steak and craftsteak did not disappoint it was my last night in vegas n decided to go all out n order the a5 wagyu new york strip japan it was delicious cooked a perfect medium rare i also ordered the gratin potatoes also delicious jus the right amount of cream apps i ordered were the raw chilled oysters cimes with 3 diff sauces i shouldve ordered 6 instead of 3 so fresh n yummy for dessert i cant remember the name but it was chocolate heaven divine excellent food n service especially my server he was friendly n helped me with the menu recommending the dishes i ate will definitely be back
  burger joint inside the cosmopolitan with great art all around the restaurant from a local vegas artist burgers were great i had the rising sun burger the spicy mayo and avocado on it was amazing highly recommended will be back to try the lobster mac n cheese
  i had a weekend warrior gig with a friend s band back in october of 2010 in charlotte and i immediately yelped good bbq i quickly found out that charlotte wasn t really known for bbq and it was more renowned for prime rib or something i wasn t as interested in luckily i found mac s speed shop up on here and my plans were set i even ended up bring a vegetarian who broke veg and got a flinstones esque bbq beef rib he was a little bit overwhelmed but satisfied i got the pulled pork and had a field day with the various sauces laid out on the table the meat was moist and delicious and the sc mustard style sauce was the reason i relished the opportunity to visit the carolinas even if i was in the wrong one the perfect blend of tang sweet and spice unfortunately i spend most of my time on the west coast and have no immediate plans to return to the south which is truly a shame since bbq is the ultimate comfort food and it s hard to find a great bbq joint in ca that isn t a chain
  we went saturday night 10 11 14 at 7 30pm hostess estimated our wait at 10 15 mins after 25 i asked where they were at with calling us and the hostess stated we were 2nd to be called we waited in view as approximately 6 other parties were seated at approximately 50 mins after first putting our name in we complained to the male manager white male 50s and he immediately sat us he offered to immediately put in a couple appetizers while we were looking over the menu and got those out asap he brought them out personally saying they had a cook standing by to quickly turn around our orders and those did come out quickly the food was good as usual nothing crazy but still nice our waitress was also on top of things they comped the appetizers we appreciate the manager writing the wrong and his sincerity
  my friends from oman were in town and asked me about the eiffel tower so i checked on yelp of course the 3 of us went for dinner on 3 12 12 and it was wonderful omg it was really really awesome the sommelier quickly came to recommend a nice red which was spot on we had 2 bottles the selection of breads was delivered with a big smile jennifer the manager came to welcome us and i mentioned her good job at replying to yelpers reviews we were just so excited to be at the eiffel tower restaurant that night valentino our waiter was patient as we were unsure what to order he made some suggestions and we quickly decided i was sure to mention that i m allergic to shellfish and it was noted immediately while our meals were prepared we received some kind of cold soup in a tiny glass i enjoyed it more than my friends then we each received a trio of tiny appetizers which was unexpected and delicious for appetizer we ordered cold foie gras rich smooth and velvety pepper marinated raw beef beef carpaccio to perfection trilogy of imported osetra caviar with different little toasts pancakes to serve it on simply delicious something i had never had for main course we ordered muscovy duck breast my friend ate it before i could try it so it must have been great it certainly looked good boneless organic rabbit super tender pieces of breast the rabbit sausage was a bit salty but sausage generally is still easy to eat though rack of lamb a refined combination of flavors and juicy tender lamb we accompanied these dishes with the potato gratin and creamed spinach and mushroom which were great sides to our main meals we felt too full to do dessert but somehow a tray of sorbets made it to our table and it was certainly refreshing one of my friends had an after dinner liqueur i can t remember which but it completed his meal i hope my friends took good care of our servers cuz i didn t get a chance to look at the bill it was one of the best meals i ve had in a long time i sure hope i get a chance to come back as there are so many things on the menu i would love to try
  we at here again tonight my husband got the linguine and clams and said it was absolutely delicious i had the lasagna and it was so good we also started with the zia s potato and sausage soup it was so good service is also great
  this place is odd but in a good way it seems like all food and beverages aside from bottled stuff is made in house you can order breakfast lunch and dinner and it looks like a home cooked meal the set up and flow is probably the most unappealing i think everyone who goes here for the first time might feel a bit uncomfortable because its hard to know what to do or where to sit they have free wi fi which is cool but there are always 100 people there using it which slows it down quite a bit all in all there needs to be more places like this phoenix is missing a real nice internet cafe this place is the best by far kudos for them
  i have been in vegas a while now and everyone says try this place i tried it once for my graduation from unlv because someone else set up the dinner for me and even then it was not as good just like my recent experience i have sat in the front hall and in the back and both have poor service the guy yolding singing dancing and so forth was semi entertaining but not enough to make me like the place i am german i love beer but this place did not satisfy my taste buds beer and food wise i tried everyone dish too because i hated mine chicken sausage and i did not like any of them not a fan at all
  best steak eggs benedict also came with fruit to start which was very refreshing two choices of beer laurentide is a local beer 710ml for 6 dollars not bad at all
  the more i come to lebowski s the more i love it i been here at least 6 times in the past few months both for lunch and dinner especially since they ve been having living social coupons like crazy man i love a good deal my boyfriend and i can t get over how a little dive bar like this has such outstanding quality food as much as i still love the veggie burger and garlic fries here i ve totally fallen in love with their salads my favorites the spinach organic baby spinach feta cheese red onion and dried cranberries and the mission bay garden greens tomato roasted corn black bean salsa sliced avocado i order both of these with a vegan patty on top and the creamy cilantro lime dressing best dressing ever my boyfriend is not a vegetarian like me but doesn t eat as much meat as the average omnivore he usually orders a veggie burger instead of a hamburger but he s totally fallen in love with the quality of the certified angus beef burger here at lebowski s this past friday we came here with a living social coupon so we wanted to try out an appetizer and we were particularly jonesin for nachos but the niagara street nachos are the only ones on the menu and are centered around grilled chicken but no worries i simply asked our waitress if they could make a vegetarian nacho plate and man oh man the chef brought on an epic order i couldn t believe tri color tortilla chips with queso shredded cheddar grilled spinach zucchini peppers tomatoes mushrooms and a side of salsa what this blew my mind
  first off i m from chicago i was raised on meat and potatoes the thought of going to a vegan restaurant has never sounded appetizing to me a few weeks ago my friend mike a fellow chicagoan took me there for lunch i m hooked been back two times in a week and a half forget about it being vegan green is just a good restaurant i have tried the argentine sandwich buffalo chicken sandwich teriyaki chicken chili cheese fries and more everything tastes great the prices are reasonable and the service is fast and friendly i love the decor it has an earthy hippie vibe my favorite thing at green is the the soynami it is their version of a dairy queen blizzard
  came here for dinner and we were starving i found the general experience to be similar to chipotle but honestly the food was better i had a burrito with chicken and guacamole that didn t come with and extra charge chips and salsa great environment i ve found a new favorite
  always enjoy the time spent there foods great and everyone is very friendly very good value for money
  monta chaya you might wonder if the quality is as good as the original one the answer is yes it s actually to our salon luxy nail salon we are regular there more like it s almost my 2nd kitchen lol monta chaya offers more appetizers than the original monta 5 stars
  the food here is yummy for the money i tried the birria de chivo lamb in a tomato type of gravy came with rice and beans as well as a stack of small thick flour tortillas all for 6 75 the lamb was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth totally delicious and definitely ethnic mexican cuisine at it s best
  delivery was by some well dresses guy with a large cheap gold watch i knew things were off after a hefty tip i opened the bag and things were missing plus the chicken was like scrap meat they scrapped off the cutting board grissel and oily i had such good food the first time this was out 2nd attempt when i called they said the chef was out on a delivery and he was the manager on duty too humm that s odd i asked them to bring me the three missing items and new chicken i paid for them they never showed repeated calls went answered all night so sad it was such a great first impression problem is owner may not even know what s going on i left several messages if your the owner of this place let me know please the first time was soooo good what happened
  just ok as it the only sit down style mexurant for 30 miles i ve eaten there a few times the food is so so it was better before the quality has dropped off however if it s busy they fall apart on service big time all the locals know just keep driving if it s full inside
  is it pronounced bath elona like the football club mes que un club trendy flash done clearly this place does not follow the same motto as the football club this is pretty much a standard ho bro spot fun but i m not really that into it cool place in moderation cheers until then get the beers in
  we got ripped off i went here last saturday night the price in the menu for hookah is 25 when we went to pay our tab the owner said it was 20 each including the person in our party who did not smoke and only had water not only were we deceived about pricing the service was mediocre if not below average don t come here
  big fan of their burgers
  if you re looking for a lot of good food and a place that will take care of you go here we had a group of 12 and they accommodated us without a hitch
  came here today service has improved immensely food is still so so i like this place very relaxing environment 7 or of 10 would recommend
  i have lunch here whenever i am at caesars the sushi is good and appropriately bite sized and i never have to wait the wife tried some of the izakaya food and it was passable i know that you can get fancier and better sushi in vegas but not as quick and easy
  we went here last night and thoroughly enjoyed everything about our experience the food was perfectly on the mark we had the grilled cheese appetizer chicken and dumplings and braised short ribs for mains and peaches and cream for dessert now all this sounds very ho hum but it was the extra touches that made it so incredible once we placed our orders they brought us out rolls served with this incredible sweet apple butter heaven the outside of the roll was crunchy and the inside was so soft and tender the grilled cheese is made with crispy pancetta perfect a blend of four cheeses that are melted to the perfect gooeyness and toasted on a foccacia that was light and crispy this comes out with a side of tomato soup that compliments the grilled cheese perfectly the chicken and dumplings was sensational the perfect blend of homey comfort food with those extra touches that made it special like using sliced snap peas which maintained a nice crunch rather than the traditional sweet peas which tend to turn mushy and the subtle herby flavor hit the mark the braised short ribs were incredibly tender didn t need a knife at all and the mashed potatoes were great perfect creamy texture but so flavorful on it s own and the green beans were cooked to just the right crispy ness by the time dessert came around we were already so full we almost didn t get it but we opted for the peaches and cream which came with a delightful light mousse atop poached peaches topped with streussel it was very tasty it was a nice sweet end to a wonderful meal
  underwhelming for last two visits few items served individually were not fresh and for a weekend night at dinner crab legs were very small service was great and i did like the prime rib ribs seafood needs to go up two notches in class compare against wynn paris mirage half the size
  pretty decent new york style pizza the crust was really good and crispy we tried the sausage which is okay if you like sliced italian sausage not crumbled we also tried the garlic knots which were okay very garlicky not sure if i would get them again
  i wish that i could say that i m exaggerating when i write the following review however i am not looking back i see that our first warning of what to come was when the non welcoming hostess corrected us when we asked if they served breakfast no we serve brunch from there we were sat at our soon to be table of dismay and frustration as we were overlooked by every single staff member there at last the bartender who for whatever reason became our server came to take our drink order of which we each ordered alcoholic beverages that lacked flavor with a hefty price tag to boot the waters we ordered no where to be seen our server who was never to return was no help in this matter so we had to do the unfortunate thing of asking other servers for it this took over 10 minutes as they forgot all about us even though our table was literally in the center of the room by the time we received our water we had a good guess that refills would be out of the question at last we put our meal orders in by our new server whose blank stare really portrayed how happy she was to be there i d like to say this story ends happily however when everyone else at my table s food arrived mine was never to appear as apparently she forgot to order mine and never checked up on us after the busser dropped the food off if she had she might have noticed doubtful that clearly a plate was missing at the table by this point as my group had begun to scarf their food down i no longer wanted to prolong our time there so when i did finally get her attention i asked her to cancel my order if she even knew what it was that i had ordered to begin with no apologies but rather looked perturbed that i was bothering her our bill as you can imagine was not timely and was missing the drinks that we had ordered with our original server weird how he suddenly remembered us now that the drinks were missing and came back to our table with the second check and asked how was everything being in the service industry myself and having a degree in hospitality it is quite upsetting to go into a restaurant such as this and have absolutely no type of apologies or even sympathy toward the above circumstances that happened i let him know of the terrible experience in which he said it couldn t have been that bad and took my check and charged us to be honest at this point i was not looking for anything free because that certainly didn t happen but rather some sort of courtesy and understanding of just how miserable the experience was if i could rate this with negative stars i would unfortunately i have no other option but to put one undeserving star
  tucked away in a corridor next to chompies sushi ko is a solid asian restaurant they are small and their menu more extensive than you would think for a small place but every time has been a pleasure i haven t been during busy hours so i cannot comment on long waits as i have had none they do close a bit early for an establishment that i would think would be open later given the crowd they would attract everyone has always been friendly though and the food delicious
  if you think that you are there for the food hot dogs are alright but a bit pricey but if you care about your whole experience the manager is the worst manager i have ever seen he is too arrogant and his only relevant customers are the ones that he is interested in if he didn t have cooks with him he couldn t have taken the orders it s good to stop by if you are hungry and around besides that it is not worth to go there
  if you come to vegas this is a must for drinks but i would pass on the food tried almost everything on the food menu and it s not impressive at all the goblets on the other hand are amazing and a must try my favorite was the gummy goblet so yummy fun
  we had 3 people in our party and decided to go to del frisco s after reading the other great yelp reviews we did not have reservations but were seated right away the bread was bought to our table right away but we did not have anything to drink our waiter came and took our drink order but still did not bring us any water 2 of us ordered the 99 power couple special a great deal both of us ordered our steaks medium well they were more like medium rare i don t like sending food back so i ended up taking my steak home the lobster mac and cheese was fantastic when it came to desert one of us ordered coffee but it did not arrive till they were almost done with desert the banana bread pudding was also great service was slow it was my birthday yet no one bothered to ask if we were celebrating anything we are local and may go back again
  milos estiatorio means restaurant in greek is a popular place in the cosmopolitan at citycenter we heard they offered a great prix fixe lunch and we ended up waiting a day for a reservation upon arrival i was surprised to see a few empty tables despite waiting customers in the lobby perhaps they were short staffed there s a small bar to the right as you enter then a large dining room with a view of the strip ask for a view table if that s important to you the prix fixe includes an appetizer a main course and a dessert for 20 13 a decent deal for a strip resto the staff were very attentive but i was a little disappointed our waitress wasn t more knowledgeable i asked her the source of their salmon and she knew only that it was farmed we decided to go with the meze plate and canadian classic for appetizers the lavraki and lamb chops for the main courses and we both had the karidopita for dessert the meze plate came with pita and three dips one with cheese and roasted red peppers tzatziki and a dip made with some kind of white fish all were pretty good but none stood out the white fish dip surprisingly didn t taste of fish at all the canadian classic consisted of nova scotia smoked salmon and half a st viateur bagel one of the best bagels you can have served with cream cheese red onions capers and a lemon wedge this was a delicious appetizer the smoked salmon was creamy and briny and the bagel tasted like it was just baked a few hours prior lavraki is a mediterranean seabass a fairly firm but mildly flavored white fish the lamb chops were available for a 10 upcharge and was served with french fries both were served a a broccoli shrub i guess they don t believe in chopping things up the bass was lightly seasoned with salt and pepper and a touch of lemon but that was enough the fish was fresh cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth considering the 10 charge i expected a bit more than than the two small lamb chops that were served they were also a little underdone i asked for medium and they were served medium rare but very tasty karidopita is a greek walnut cake flavored with cinnamon and moistened with a light simple syrup it was served at milos with an interesting mint and evergeen flavored ice cream the cake was moist and sweet but not cloyingly so and airy the crumb was a bit rough but that could be normal for this cake the ice cream was really the star in my opinion i wouldn t call it delicious but the flavor was so interesting i wanted more than the dollop atop the cake all in all we thoroughly enjoyed the meal here and particularly thought the prix fixe was well worth it for the quality of food a great find
  buffet is okay good variety of good not the best but pretty good for the price i had the prime rib sushi crab legs fried rice which was a little dry the green beans and some other stuff it was pretty good considering i was a little tipsy
  one of the two best new mexican style restaurants in the east valley and to boot it s been here for a long time rustic southwest decor with fun friendly and at times eclectic personalities to serve you plus flavorful dishes with hints of red and green chile or both if you d like we went there on new year s eve well after the bedroom community schedule keeper s had eaten and rather than close early like many places they were open and running on all cylinders having fun alongside all the guests if you re thinking of giving this place a shot try the carne adovada as it s the best in the county hands down if you ve been before and have tried the carne adovada give the meat loaf a shot lastly very good salsa and a full bar and there s a window for pick up orders and that s something all restaurants should have
  let s talk about sushi better yet revolving sushi great for a bunch of friends or just a cute little date night right before the movies super inexpensive and you can leave that place with a belly full of yummy sushi for just under 10 00 bucks i mean a lot of sushi for 10 00 go try it they are great and friendly
  delicious got the gordon burger perfectly cooked good job christina she even took a moment to take a picture with the kids
  very good food but maybe making it for so many people at the same time doesn t let the food cook throughly still very delicious and fun place
  always great customer service for sure the best burger in the west valley the topping are either free or cheap and the mushrooms are always so flavorful try the haystacks you won t be disappointed
  sorry folks but this place is terrible i had heard my friends raving about it for awhile but finally had the uh opportunity to try it out myself when i first walked in i noticed it was just 9 for a big bowl far cheaper than what i m used to paying at genghis grill sounds good right well when i got to the food selections i noticed a few things first the meat was frozen second there are only four meat options frozen chicken frozen beef frozen turkey and frozen pork third the vegetable selection is limited you ll have your lettuce carrots cabbage tomatoes onions mushrooms noodles tofu and bean sprouts but there s not much more no eggs baby corn or anything else that might be interesting oh and no dry seasonings the sauces were encouraging i liked the idea of mixing and matching the different components after i tasted my food however backtracked on the sauce my bowl was quite soupy but very bland the sauces have almost no flavor whatsoever now i know why they provide that hot mustard you need it if you want to actually taste something the portions were great but i didn t even finish mine because it was just a bland soupy mess of frozen garbage i think i ll spend the few extra bucks on genghis
  last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back both times i was with a group 6 the first time 7 last night and was fortunate enough to get a table outside which makes me the happiest person ever to be able to eat and watch the bellagio fountains from the host to the server to the bus staff everyone was very polite and professional we initially wanted to eat at olives in the bellagio but were told by a stone faced hostess that it would be impossible without a reservation i won t try going back there even if it s empty the food at mon ami gabi is very very good my husband and i had our two sons and three of their friends with us all ranging from 19 22 years old so my husband ordered escargot without telling them what it was when it arrived they loved it and even had another piece after we told them what it was the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he s ever eaten i had the trout and it was outstanding make sure you get the pomme frites with your steak they are crispy and delicious i will definitely plan a meal here every time i m in vegas
  the hubby and i came here at a strange time on memorial day there was no line the food was excellent this was the largest burrito bowl i have ever received from a chipotle they were very generous it tasted fantastic i love how they marinate their chicken we left very happy
  i give this place 4 stars because it takes so freaking long to wait in line and the layout of the buffet could be better the food is great though
  mario s is better on weeknights it gets waaaaay too packed on the weekends monday nights they have live music it usually sucks
  this is my go to spot great coffee and good food i love to go here to catch up on work at night it s the only 24 hour late night coffee house near summerlin only gripe is it s small usually busy and can be hard to find a table to get some work done i guess that is a good problem to have
  loved it little pricey but so good
  note i did not have a shake as i am allergic to milk but my friends did and they loved their shakes so three cheers for their shakes the burgers looked good to me but i didn t want to be bloated when we went out later so i ordered the pork belly in the steamed bun with hoisin sauce the steam bun is taco shell shaped and was perfect but the pork belly was definitely overcooked i was looking for the juicy melt in your mouth pork belly that compliments steam buns so well and i got overcook chewy burnt on the edges pork belly pieces that i had to dissect before eating really the ambience is really nice but be warned they do not take reservations during the weekend we were lucky that we were able to get a table right away but were prepared to wait if we needed to also the woman s bathroom is a single stall style bathroom and for a restaurant of that size it was a little small and there was always a line they are located inside the cosmopolitan hotel
  they have ny style egg rolls are traditional fried rice love that they are friendly too atmosphere is a little stuffy but it s a given with this location
  it s been a good 2 years since i was last here and that was a sober up sit down post moon but damn there are some deals to be found here fremont street prices right on west flamingo 3 99 for a really large ham steak hash browns 2 eggs and 2 big slices of toast is a knockout deal that i will be back for they offer this from 10am 10pm my brother doesn t dig on swine so he went with the steak for 3 more and finished even quicker than i did we marveled at some of the new deals they have if you have a palms players card some standouts included late night specials like ayce pancakes for 4 99 from 11pm 6am and ayce ribs chicken cole slaw corn bread on wednesday for 9 99 there would be a line out the door for some of these if binion s offered them you can check them all out here http www palms com dining las vegas 247 cafe fortunes the chinese restaurant is also there and you can order from both menus they also have a bunch of deals granted the food could be awful but i would consider saving up all day for some of these if i were a homeless bum http www palms com dining las vegas fortunes
  ended up here because soul gastrolounge had a 2 hour wait but im glad we did because everything was so good the grilled calamari with eggplant so good small dish though baked brie brulee it was okay but way too much and heavy for one person good to share the jelly and chutney was semi on the edge of too sweet but still good came with a variety of chips breads tried friend s chicken with pumpkin really good the pumpkin bread was delicious friends also enjoyed fried brussel sprouts and mussels so cute inside good service would totally go back
  lets face it the food court can get pretty boring my coworkers and i often visit f2o during our lunch break the appetizers are nicely portioned for one person i totally recommend ordering the chicken fingers and or calamari i m guilty of ordering chicken fingers with a side of mac cheese this will fill you up another favorite of my pallet is the blu cheese fig salad yassss this salad completes my life seriously of course it s enough to feed two people so it s well worth getting oh the freshly made dispense beverages are so amazing you may never have another fountain drink in your life personally i love the mint lemonade best ever anywho i ll probably have lunch here tomorrow this review is not over foodie
  went back for the blueberry pancakes best in the area great breakfast experience
  i m a sucker for a good hot dog and with the options for hot dogs here you can call me the hugest sucker in the world i only just visited this place for the first time last week and i m hooked in the two visits i have had three of their unique dogs and all i can say is oh my god they are so good and so worth it each hot dog can be customized several different ways to your liking from the type of dog you get to the bun it s on the three dogs i tried were the pittsburgh memphis and mexican all unique in their own sense and all righteously delicious the pittsburgh features a smashed pirogi and cole slaw the memphis features bbq sauce and potato sticks the mexican features fresca salsa fresco queso and guacamole each mixes the different flavors perfectly and each satisfies just as perfectly each time i had a dog i also ordered the pomme frites with a different dipping sauce i highly suggest you try the garlic aoili the beer selection changes depending on what s in season and the selection must be a great when i was in each time my first option was always gone the warmer months allows for the air to flow through here the front has garage doors like opening that not only allows the air in but the noise out this also makes for a good time as you can people watch tuesday nights are a great night to stop in here take in a game of full contact trivia while chowing down on some great food winning gets you either 50 off your tab or a round of free hot dogs for your table
  400 reviews would this one make any difference great food great service excellent beer
  service was very friendly helpful and attentive great prices nice atmosphere my steak and my husbands were both cooked a perfect med rare thanks
  disgusting need to be shut down maybe we should have clued in when they make your pay first
  always a nice quite place to grab a cold beer their asian chicken salad is very good and filling
  i thought i settled for the closest restaurant because i was exhausted and perhaps having zero expectations made this experience all the better background is that my 17 year old daughter and i started in ohio 4 days ago and have visited 5 colleges since my husband joined us at purdue university of wisconsin is our last stop before heading home and after being bossed around by a short spoiled diva for what it felt like 10 years we were excited for the possibility of a drink she stayed in the hotel room thank god and we walked across the street to a shabby suspect looking old building with their name on it it had decent yelp reviews so that is the only reason we tried it omg sat in the bar at a table that bordered the dining room and started with an old fashioned ordered a sausage arugula pizza to start thought i died and went to heaven had to reevaluate our menu choices because we were already satisfied seasonal soup of pork meatball white bean kale escarole and tomato was rich and satisfying want the recipe i ordered the orachietti with sausage and rapini which was in a cream sauce kissed with brandy yum ordered a glass of wine with dinner nice selection nice pour we skipped dessert to deliver our piping hot margarita pizza to our sick daughter across the street which she devoured in 10 minutes helpful kind efficient knowledgable staff completely pleasant experience best of our midwest college tour
  it s a fast food type of place but it doesn t seem like the other fast food establishments it s clean modern spacious and it smells good they even have good handwash for bulking season i tried this place and got me a chicken tenders combo with fries you get a sauce but you can get more sauces for extra i tried the garlic sauce and ranch the garlic sauce was sweet and didn t taste like garlic the price isn t bad the chicken was not mystery chicken parts they have sandwiches salads burgers shakes etc
  i like zoe s kitchen i even tried to put the umlaut above the o in zoe but alas i lack that sort of nasa grade training an assortment of sandwiches sides and salads are on hand for the taking well you can t just take them you have to pay of course i don t want to be blamed when a rash of sandwich robberies breaks out along the mcdowell corridor but i ve gotten off on a tangent again i ve only ever tried the gruben i think i need an umlaut there too no we re good good like a reuben but with fresh cabbage and turkey much healthier and with a tangy kick a good quick place to grab a sandwich during your lunch break zoe s sides are available by the pound chicken potato pasta tuna and egg salads they will cater your next event and if you ve ever seen those honda elements running around phoenix with zoe s name plastered along the sides you know that they deliver or maybe you re under the impression that those cars are actually mobile kitchens well that s just silly
  i love good food i like great service i enjoy hip atmospheres not only did gordon ramsey steak deliver on all fronts it blew past all expectations and flew through the roof it s all been said look at the sheer number of reviews this place has but i ll never forget the alaskan king crab or the mac n cheese hell even the sticky toffee pudding was some of the richest and most decadent i ve ever tasted that s right i ve written two paragraphs without one word mentioning beef that s because i don t eat beef and yet i d come back to this spot in a heartbeat our party of 5 had a range of dishes from oysters foie gras and crab legs to start to tuna sea bass beef wellington and an actual steak for our mains the sides were just as tasty as the mains and dessert mixed with coffees and chocolate spoons filled with liqueurs just topped the entire experience we had too many cocktails and enough wine for a village which made it all the better if you re looking for a mouth watering dining experience this is your place
  today our order took an hour and a half to get here and once it got here the chicken wings were soggy and cold the calzones were undercooked and on top of it all one calzone was missing and we were offered only a refund or a calzone 2 hours after our order was placed
  best spicy catfish in town pud prig king is a bomb and the best part is ice water is soo good waiter said 4 filters filtration
  what a wonderful little find here i m so jealous of people who live near camelback mountain because that means this kitchen is only a small walk or drive away i started off my sunday morning with one of their prickly pear infused tequila margaritas i polished that off so quickly that they already had a 2nd one on its way to me only after being 15 minutes there from the name chicken nachitos you would expect a little appetizer on a saucer with little bites of chicken and a spoonful of guac and chips but instead you get a huge platter filled with slow roasted shredded chicken gallops of cheese heaps of guac and some slices of jalepeno peppers bryan and i shared plates of the swordfish tacos and of course the short rib tacos we had to try them since they re award winning right both did not disappoint they were great tasting and not overfilling since you could pace yourself easily with the small homemade corn tortillas they created the tortillas were actually white not yellow in color and slightly browned and were a little smaller than a cd dvd in size it would probably take you about 3 4 little tortillas to finish all the meat on the taco plate each taco plate came with a mound of guacamole a little saucer of salsa and another mount of kale quinoa mix that was delicious eating kale and quinoa mixed together definitely was healthier than my usual rice obsession i know there was dressing on the quinoa mix but since quinoa tends to have protein in it and not just carbs it just made me a little less guilt ridden fulfilling my need to eat my way into a sunday morning food coma i guess you could throw all that gibberish about healthy eating anyway because i forgot to mention that i also ordered the mac and cheese side if you look up the word indulgence in the dictionary i am pretty sure there is a picture of this mac and cheese next to that word the service was okay i think our waiter s mind was somewhere else because he didn t check in on us enough bryan and his dad ordered coffee and our waiter said that he would refill those coffees and kept forgetting we finally had to ask someone else to bring us another coffee pot we said that we needed 2 boxes for separate left overs and he brought 1 box these are just a few small things but after reading all the other reviews i thought the service would be great so we were all a little disappointed about that i m sure he was just having an off day because otherwise the atmosphere was really nice we sat indoors today but on a late afternoon it d be nice to grab a few drinks and sit outside on the patio it s too bad this place is so far away from me
  xtremely horrible should be the name i honestly can say this is the worst sushi i have ever had besides vons pre made rolls the rice is not even close to sushi quality the fish is not fresh the service well there is none it would be nice to get a drink before you are half way done with your meal when you pay 30 bucks for all you can eat you would like to order what you like but some guy in street clothes kept bringing over half rolls from other peoples half orders for me to finish trust me on this one there are plenty more sushi restaurants on eastern that will blow this place away even if they dont have a outdoor patio looking at a parking lot urghh im feeling sick even writing about this place
  this is a pretty typical panera bread location it s always best to come early to make sure you have first chance at all the pastries my favorite is the pecan roll and those go fast so by the afternoon they re always gone service is friendly and solid they get very busy during the breakfast and lunch rush but if you go before or after you re good
  good beer selection although beer from the taps always tastes funny flat buckets of beers are cheap food is decent and very reasonably priced the bar is very smoky at night though you will leave there smelling like an ashtray unfortunately
  blundered onto this place as i had a business meeting nearby and my gf wanted a burger it was a nice surprise had a 20 min wait on a friday around 2pm so i knew the food must be good it was oxtail chili cheese fries were a little sweet but the portion was large and the quality of the chili and fries was excellent had the kiki burger and the black and green both great choices and satisfying service was top notch and friendly hard to go wrong with bachi burger wahlburgers better step up their game when they come to town with places like this to compete with
  went back to give this place another try i received some off yelp criticism that i should have tried the philly cheesesteak because the chicken parm i had earlier wasn t a main menu item and was just in a supporting role so off today i went to see if i just made a bad menu choice i had a 10 philly cheesesteak and a medium french fry so first the french fries tasted fine but i got about 25 shorties half of the french fries were about 3 4 of inch long next the main attraction the winning cheesesteak was just not so winning just so i m clear the bread it s good has decent crunch and is fairly flavorful the amount of meat reasonable for the sandwich but definitely not generous the chicken parm had next to no meat on it the flavor this is the where and why that this place just falls flat on its face once again the predominate flavor of the whole sandwich is grilled onions the steak is flavorless the mushrooms non existent the banana peppers ok it just ends up tasting like a whole bunch nothing i taste grease and onions i see no compelling reason to try this again the chicken parm and steak tasted almost the same to me i almost couldn t tell the difference when you start having multiple proteins taste the same you re doing something wrong if you want a decent sandwich try either fernando s on liberty pretty decent or peppi s even better on smithfield towards the bridge fernando s is the closest to psecs but peppi s serves a better sandwich get either the ultra cheesesteak or the blazing saddle and see my previous reviews on yelp for both of them thumbs down psecs thumbs down
  i think this place has markedly improved since it opened it s not the best place in town but the food is about average or slightly above they make one of my favorites almond chicken just like i m used to from california their fried rice is decent if you order it dark xo pad thai is pretty good hubby likes their roast duck we really like boba drinks all in all a pretty decent little chinese joint
  i love hotdogs so when a friend told me about pinks i had to try this place they offer many different style hot dogs standard kelly style and vegetarian i tried the standard hot dog with chilli onions and mustard wow this combo was incredible the chilli was very tasty mixed with meat and beans it really made the hot dog taste out of this world if you like hot dogs you must try this place the onion rings are pretty damn good also a message for my connecticut yelpers in new britain capital lunch who i m serious
  a large group of us decided to go out here tonight as another reviewer stated the garlic fries smelled amazing although i didn t have any walking through the restaurant we debated on sitting inside or outside and chose outside since the weather was nice when we got out there they had the misters running which normally would be a good idea i m sure since it s the middle of the desert but it was totally unnecessary tonight of the 8 adult males at our table all 8 were nearly shivering shirts table menus appetizers etc were all wet too we asked the waitress to see if they could turn it down or off didn t hear anything back asked again about 20 minutes later and the response was that she could go ask the manager if we wanted her to but that would mean that she was going to sweat her ass off for 8 hours direct quote which tells me that she completely blew us off the first time so i did notice that our table was up on an elevated part of the patio which places us closer to the misters pretty bad design it may be worth looking into nozzles with a different flow rate or just capping off every other one on that level of the patio additionally the restaurant was just not that busy and our food still came out piecemeal with one in our party waiting an extra 10 minutes for his food and everything was just slow experience aside i ordered the seafood stew and it was great all sorts of seafood but not an overwhelming fishy flavor there was enough but it was balanced and the real unique thing was the fennel i ve never had fennel in a seafood soup before and it was perfect i think it offset the fishiness enough to keep it from being one dimensional
  i am really in love with kj kitchen i only go during dinner time they serve you a bowl of beef and vegetable broth soup that is so simple tasting but very tasty and also a sweet bean dessert that blends in the flavors with your after dinner taste to send you off home just right everything on the menu is delicious i love the duck salt pepper pork chop salt pepper fried chicken steamed ginger chicken singapore noodles and anything that i have ordered on the menu has not failed me yet i don t recommend coming for lunch i tried it once and it wasn t as good as dinner the chef at kj kitchen during dinner is the best
  best creme brule ever the menu was great and i had piglet ribs that were delicious everyone s meals were outstanding highly recommend this spot
  this past sunday we ordered some items to go combination 3 and the jefe steak what a mistake we nearly ended up at the hospital with severe cramps fever and stomach aches really bad doubtt it very seriously that we will return
  the pizza is bomb fresh ingredients everything s made to order the staff are quick and friendly i crave this place all the time now well worth it
  after living in vegas for about a year this is easily the most disappointing high end meal i ve had i d give the food a 4 5 but the service was probably a 1 5 service the first disappointment was waiting we had a reservation and even so i can understand waiting by the bar for a few minutes however we wanted far more than a few minutes our leader went up to the front to inquire and they said on someone will be by shortly to seat you that didn t happen so we had to check back again and someone gave us the apology of oh i m sorry i thought they came and got you maybe a miscommunication but certainly something that could be excused however things didn t get better from there it seems like about 10 minutes from when we seated until we even got drink menus then another 10 15 before the drinks arrive easily 15 minutes before bread arrived at the table it just felt like everything was so slow after the first round of drinks came our waitress or waitresses seemingly disappeared i mean when you have a table of 10 people ordering rounds of 15 cocktails or better you d figure service would be fast i think they easily missed out on at least 1 extra round due to the slow service if you look at the prices at mastro s and compare it to other places across town you would expect to have a waiter or waitress that knows the menu back and forth and can describe all of the stars we got none of that i would say our service was at the level of an average chain restaurant you aren t adding any value when you ask about menu items and the waitress just lists 3 things that are good we asked how the steaks come and the reply was something like what do you mean i mean are they seasoned sauced dry aged there is no explanation on the menu or listing of sauces or accompaniments for the steaks oh yeah they are seasoned and broiled thanks this was followed up with no description or explanation of any sides during the meal we couldn t even locate the waitresses and people were still anxious to get more drinks i will say that the food was good the steak was unique in the regard it was so warm when it came out usually food has somewhat cooled but their steak still had a sizzle and was warm for the first few bites pretty good the asparagus was nothing special the lobster mashed potatoes were good but at 40 can be steep for a side dish crab gnocchi was good but i m not crazy about gnocchi so i m not an expert the problem in vegas is that you can find a place equal to mastro s food wise with probably lower prices so suffering through bad service can be a deal breaker needless to say nobody ordered dessert or drinks after dinner with so many other options in town for steak i probably wouldn t come back for that i will say i tried the ahi tuna sashimi which seemed great for under 40 i didn t try it but the swordfish looked the same i would come back if i was in the mood for seafood but would be nervous about the service maybe with a smaller party and a better table things would be better
  great food nice atmosphere awesome owner big menu with large portions lots of beer selections all affordable delicious highly recommend
  i really enjoyed my visit to this place the room has an elegant high class steakhouse look and offers the usual steak house pricing model expensive steaks separate charges for salads sides and sauces i started with a spinach salad with bacon vinaigrette this thing was big enough to share or eat as a meal and it was delicious i followed with a filet which casem perfectly cooked and was tender and tasty i ordered a bordelaise sauce on the side and it was so good i was sopping it up with my bread oh and when i first sat down they brought a basket of bread which included a solid french bread an interesting fruit and nut bread my only criticisms of this place are 1 they need a list of spirits better server knowledge about the bar offerings or a more completely stocked bar so that i don t have to play guess what scotch we have with the server who then has to run to the bar and then back to me and then back to the bar and 2 the steak could have used more seasoning nothing exotic just a little salt and pepper man but overall after a day of cheap drinks and snacks a starbucks this place provided a solid meal and drink well worth the cost
  this was my favorite buffet on the strip decor was nice tables had servers and it felt high end for a buffet visited for dinner the deserts were fantastic they even had gluten free options although those were a bit dry the staff was pretty unfriendly our server was not very nice and seemed irritated he had to refill our drinks and pick up our food the dessert chef was kind of elitest but who cares the food totally made up for it pasta was incredible pizza wood fired sushi and crab leg options as well i wanted to visit caesars palace but the price was a bit high and we ended up here only reason this got a 3 star was due to the staff most looked like they hated their life and hated their job more
  i came here with a group of 9 on a saturday night it s a bit out of the way so we drove took a taxi there pretty good for vegas but i can get pho better than this anywhere back home i wish there was more fatty flank broth was pretty good we got various types of spring rolls some with sausage some fried vegetarian these were also pretty decent i also got an iced vietnamese coffee that was decent for some reason the restroom is located outside the restaurant around the back
  i absolutely love everything i get from this place all of the food is really good and the price perfect that being said my only complaint warning would be the online ordering i have ordered egg drop soup as my add on for the lunch special several times now and have ended up receiving an egg roll after calling the restaurant to let them know what happened they asked for the egg roll back i declined in fear it would make its way to someone else s order i would recommend calling an order in if it contains soup
  overall awful experience food was good horrible customer service owner is very unprofessional she literally started a fight in the middle of the restaurant and got in our face no common courtesy no attempt to even make customer happy
  my husband and i went there for happy hour we almost ordered everything from the happy hour menu and everything was excellent we sat on the patio and was very relaxing the service was great we suggest ordering the goyza california roll crunchy roll and anything with the fries we will be definitely going back
  we just happened to be next to this restaurant and the thought of thai food sounded delectable after checking yelp and seeing all of the good reviews we decided to give this place a try we had our 5 year old daughter with us and i was very surprised to see a kids menu not only that but when they brought us our water they brought her a small kids cup of water with a lid on it very thoughtful and i was quite surprised we started with their thai spring rolls which were delicious and the hubby ordered the much talked about drunken noodles with beef and i had the yellow curry with chicken a little bit spicy my daughter enjoyed the corn dog and french fries the hubby loved his drunken noodles and was cautioned by the waitress that they are very filling she was not exaggerating i also found the yellow curry to be quite filling and extremely delicious if you are in the area and have the hankering for an extremely yummy thai restaurant you just have to stop at yupha s it was one we will remember and return to again in the near future
  tons of beer lost a star for at best avg food
  good fish and chips but found them to be greasier than i m used to place is usually full but if there s a place to sit at you re better off sitting down for a nice hot meal i did takeout once and boy everything turned to mush and really wet paper bag no one wants wet paper bag and no mush greasy fish either on cold days i greatly enjoy their chowder with a spoonful of pepper it clears those nasal canals really well i don t know if its the best chowder in town as its not that easy to find but i found it to be good portion sizes are indeed quite filling so sampling is not recommended by yourself nevermind what i said if your stomach is a blackhole the u shaped table makes the experience more fun than sitting staring at a damn wall for 30 minutes a mirror would improve things as one can always ask who s the fairest of them all while enjoying some fish p
  delicious warm local i crave this place every other week even though it s a 25 minute drive from home i love this place so much you get so much food for such a small price i usually get the teriyaki chicken with a side of kimchi and a musubi to go boyfriend usually gets the roast pork because it s so soft we usually eat there or we take it to go and either eat at home work or drive 5 minutes west on sunset road and eat at the park bought a musubi for my best friend and told me the style and flavors reminded her of the ones the make in hawaii so i guess it s pretty authentic
  rundown had the pre theater menu interesting decor it looked a bit dated but still lovely view of the bellagio fountians are wonderful at night get a seat near the windows for optimum view only bad thing they can t make a cosmo it was the worst cosmo i ve ever had after my first quarter of gradschool my boyfriend and i took a trip to vegas to celebrate after finals while we were here my boyfriend wanted to try picasso since this was on his list of must try vegas resturants we ended up with the prefixed menu because we were on a time crunch due to our tickets to see the lion king that evening the resturant is very accomodating and very polite our original reservations were for two but we changed it at the last minute because we wanted another friend to come along the staff and hosts were very polite exactly what i expect from a resturant like picasso while i loved the service i wasn t impressed by the drinks i honestly feel that it went downhill from the drink i had ordered a cosmo my standard drink to order and it was the absolute worst cosmo i ve ever had the ratio was off and it tasted too sour while i thought it was all in my head my boyfriend and friend both agreed that the drink was way off and didn t even taste good moving along amuse bouche consisteted of warm soup made with a red bell pepper if i remember correctly and a small croquette on the side the croquette wasn t overly flavorfull and was really good first dish was poach oysters with bits of caviar the light sauce made the oysters delish it was great with a bit of lemon too my main dish was the sauteed fliet of halibut and the boyfriend had the veal chops i love halibut but i made the biggest mistake of ordering the halibut dry and not flavorful and wouldn t recommend anyone ordering the diesh the veal chops on the other hand were really good tender and moist and wasn t overcooked they came with potatoes sauteed mushrooms that went well with the chops there were a few options for dessert and the three of us tried three different types we had ordered the chocolate fondant which came with a side of vanilla gelato great taste and ate every bite of it to accompany our desserts they also served little jellies which topped off the dessert while the halibut and cosmo were horrible i d still like to come by and try the tasting menu one day
  the overlook grill has a very summer y feel to it the theme of the restaurant has the colors yellow and white and the hosts and waitresses wear really cute matching summer dresses that makes the whole setting 10x even better cause i feel like i m in the caribbeans the restaurant is located outside in the pool area near to marquee nightclub i really liked the restaurant and the service was spectacular however the choices of food items are very limited the menu only has about 15 items and every single item is very different from the other i was really hungry and hungover but who isn t in vegas and seeing the menu made me feel very disappointed what we ended up ordering was 12 kalua pork tosta and 20 1 dozen raw oysters to share as for drinks we had a 6 corona and a 12 bloody mary i would pass on the kalua pork tostas there are only 2 and the portions are really small i really wish they told us that what we ordered wasn t enough to share because the wait for the food took a long time as well when the oysters were brought out my immediate reaction was wtf they re so tiny but never judge a book by it s cover they were the best damn oysters i ve ever had in my life and trust me i ve tried a variety of oysters from a variety of locations they actually weren t that small because the oysters were actually pretty meaty and fresh yum i probably would only come back for the oysters and that s probably it the rest of the meal was pretty pricey on a side note i felt kind of bad for tipping our waitress too because the only time she ever came to our table was to hand us our check the manager and the hostess were the ones who helped us out the entire time i wish i tipped them instead
  i think i may have a new favorite restaurant liliana s was very nice and i will definitely go back again soon like andy p we went on a friday night without reservations we waited about 45 minutes but it didn t seem long at all the decor is excellent and probably a bit nicer than we expected very impressive and good service we also started with the jalapeno cranberry hush puppies they were very good but i expected a bit more cranberry or jalapeno flavor from them good none the less but maybe a bit much for two people better for 4 or 5 i think we ordered the jambalaya and the scallops for dinner both were cooked very well and were excellent probably the best jambalaya i have had in a while only complaint was it could have had a touch more heat i guess i like it pretty spicy cost was pretty decent for what we ate and overall it was a great experience and a great value they look to have a lot of special menu events and tastes as well definitely a place i will return to again soon
  it was quite a wait for a deep dish pizza but from what i heard it was really good i ordered a meatball sandwich and it was so good but the portion sizes were too big which didn t allow us room for dessert apparently what they are known for next time we will split an entree and dessert
  i love this place get the chicken and rice the chicken is really good and flavorful i can eat two portions at one time so i order three so i can have a snack later on too the price is great for the portion size i love when a place does something simple and does a great job at it
  had brunch with my sister on a monday at noon restaurant is small and was not busy there is one person working serving the whore restaurant food was excellent i ordered the angus burger i ordered it medium and it was made exactly how i wanted it the fries and delicious also my sister ordered the steak and eggs which was also great the steak was a little too well done but it was still delicious i would have given the place 4 stars but it took 35 mins for the food to come out thank god we were not in a hurry this is a perfect place to order from if you re going to the pool food and service was great i just wish i didn t take 35 mins for my food
  i would like to start off with my very first trip here about a month ago was absolutely delightful their antipasto salad was amazing now to this current visit i ordered the same exact thing and to be honest i am getting disappointed in the special balsalmic dressing that they make it has so much thick oil than anything else it leaves your salad drenched in oil and that s what you taste it ruins it you end up blotting your salad to soak up the excess oil it makes the lettuce soggy quickly this same exact thing happened at the surprise location as well so it is disappointing we asked the waitress who walked by our table and she clarified on the ingredient ratio for oil to vinegar and i think they need to rethink that or be consistent and have 1 person make the stuff seriously consistency is the key i showed her my salad and poured out on a plate as to what actually my dressing looked like she agreed it didn t look good either she was nice enough to offer me another salad but i ate the one i had so instead gave me a free lunch because i was unhappy about spending 10 dollars on my meal that half of it tasted like i was eating an oil sponge she then proceeded to tell me that i should ask for a spoon the next time and have the dressing on the side so i could take out what oil i didn t want what the heck if i have to do that what is the point of paying for it may as well eat a salad at home with my own dressing that i don t have to mess with or alter right so in my opinion if you are a salad lover and want to try their salads don t get the balsalmic dressing go for ranch you are safe with that i am a fan of the pizza there it is tasty i love the big kahuna also i will have to say they do care about their customer satisfaction which is great and they don t get defensive about any issues customers have so i gave them 4 stars for that alone thanks for reading
  the food is good but a bit over priced hubs ordered filet medium rare and it was cooked perfectly but at 50 the steak better blow your socks off meh one thing that did blow our socks off were the skillet potatoes sweet baby jesus those are good skip the mashed potatoes and order the skillet potatoes you ll be thanking me later i had the halibut because i wasn t feeling like steak the fish was slightly overcooked and the sauce was super salty i like salt but this was like eating a spoonful a salt with every bite lesson learned stick with the specialty if you re in the mood for dessert like we were order the oreo ice cream pie cake mmmmmm huge portion of delicious oreo crusted ice cream cake you may hate yourself the next day at the gym but it s totally worth it
  the best part about this place is that they give you complimentary hot tea otherwise their broth is bland and they barely gave me any tendon pieces price wise they re average about 8 for a small gonna keep looking for something better
  this time we did the teppanyaki and we were not disappointed tons of food really good too
  inexpensive incredible and the food is out of this world didn t expect this from a hole in the wall in tempe cornish pasty company is a place you must visit if you are in the surrounding area not only is the food delicious but the atmosphere puts you right into the heart of eurpoe a must have are the garlic chips which are actually thick french fries
  stopped in for lunch and it was definitely a solid meh lunch buffet is 8 99 which was a bit steep considering the lack of selections only 2 chicken dishes chicken curry and tandoori chicken neither spectacular the vegetable curry was fine but again nothing special and everything else was quite bland i won t be returning
  i have heard of serendipity for a very long time now and always wanted to go there when i went to nyc and i was super excited when i heard they opened up a location in vegas it is located right by cesar s palace even though i was extremely stuffed i made sure to make room to get a frozen hot chocolate here i got it togo since i wanted to do some gambling the wait wasn t too bad i got my drink relatively quickly a small frozen hot chocolate costs 10 and a larger costs 14 i opted for the small size since i knew i couldn t finish the large size it was really good i loved it and so did my friends very refreshing in the 100 degree weather next time i will have to dine there to try to get the whole experience cant wait to go back
  i m a slacker about reservations so going in on feb 13th i shouldn t have been surprised it was booked we sat at the bar and let me enthusiastically recommend this option to everyone the service was fast fantastic and the food was just as good as the first couple times my husband and i went
  very good place when you are in uptown for an event
  slightly uppity ambiance but who cares the food is so good the service was awesome we had a reservation and arrived early so we had a drink at the bar i m not usually a fancy cocktail girl but these fine tuned hand crafted cocktails aren t a bad thing the bartender aaron was really nice and seemed quite vested in his drinks our waiter was also awesome he had some good advice like the ribeye is a bigger portion than the rack of lamb and even showed a bit of concern over just ordering a raviolo for my entree i ate two other first courses though hahaaa the food was delicious i don t know if it s this local food thing or preparations but how come the ribeye just tastes like heaven i was surprised to see that they had salt and pepper at the table we didn t have to use any everything was seasoned really well also can someone tell me why don t i live closer so i can try the changing raviolos on a regular basis anyways everything was good make a reservation and go have a nice night out it s so worth it
  just love this place i love the modern hip atmosphere not overdone sincere friendly service and amazing mouth watering dishes spinach salad was good to the last bite with very light nutty taste and the chicken special was probably the juiciest well cooked chicken i had ever eaten and the bianchi pizza mmmm mmmm mmmm what did they put in their dough man it s out of this world good another great find thx to groupon this time i think their 2 brick ovens due forni are gonna make me come here often
  after having read the reviews on yelp i was extremely excited to go to alex and indulge in fine dining i mean you are after all in vegas price 165 for a 3 course meal options 3 or 5 course fixed meal only wine extensive wine list a dress sophisticated i m sad to say though that my experience wasn t as good as some others in this forum i have mixed feelings since some points were positive while others weren t so much my boyfriend and i came here dressed up suit and cocktail dress the dinning room did look grand and sophisticated it made me feeling like i m in ballroom i love the colors the only thing i wasn t super fond of was the flowers all over curtains i m assuming they are fake flowers not dried up flowers it made the curtains look very tacky i think the curtains by themselves would have done justice to the room as is we weren t given an option to sit in the patio but since it was cold i didn t mind sitting indoors since i was indecisive about making a selection with what wine to go with the waiter was kind enough to allow me to sample between two it made a huge difference because the one i originally wanted to go with i end up not liking it as much after we picked our pre fixed selections we were given a sampler courtesy of the chief it was yummy and very kind of them but i later noticed that everyone in the room got one courtesy of the chief so it didn t really feel that special anymore but that s okay i was still very happy with it the scallop soup was my boyfriend s favorite i liked them all though because they were all so different just a note i think this sampler isn t always the same another yelper had something else 1st course appetizer the oysters were beautifully placed on a huge bed of salt it was delicious the lobster was slightly over cooked and my boyfriend wasn t too happy about that he feels that for what you re paying everything should be perfect there should be no oversight 2nd course main course the rabbit and veal were delicious at this point of the evening alex came out and greeted every party individually that was really cool to see the chef 3rd course dessert wow is the best word to describe it we had a lot of dessert alex was kind enough to give us a platter of different types of dessert aside from what we ordered the madelines were really good and soft it was warm like it was just out of the oven we ordered the malted chocolate and banana napoleon and it was okay the roasted pineapple basque with vanilla crisps and coconut sorbet was really good and i do recommend that at the time of reservation i did let the operator know that my boyfriend and i were celebrating our anniversary at the end of our meal they gave us a dessert with a little cracker saying happy anniversary that was very sweet of them a yelper mentioned that they received macarons when they left alex i got the same thing so i was super excited to try it i m sad to say but it just wasn t good i ve had macarons at different places before and it just doesn t even come close to comparing i do like the variety but it was dry i let my expert macaron friend try it too and she said it wasn t good either overall i have mixed reviews of this restaurant it was good but it wasn t great like another yelper said it was good but not memorable i think if the food was more consistent i would give it a higher rating the service was terrific and i did really enjoy the ambiance i especially liked that they had a little chair for my bag that was very classy my boyfriend said he had better fine dining experiences at another restaurant which costs about the same as a result i m giving it 3 and 1 2 stars i guess i have high expectations of alex but who wouldn t for fine dining
  3 5 stars there is a nice sushi roll selection with sashimi but the other non sushi items weren t that great hibachi corner is okay but they cook it with extra soy sauce so my food turned out salty there is a chocolate fondue fountain but only stale marshmellows to dip we saw the sign off the road saying all you can eat lobster but it s not fresh lobster but it s cooked in a heavy sauce this is an a ok sushi buffet there are better ones in town
  bacchanal buffet is probably the best buffet in vegas actually it is the best buffet in vegas hence the near 50 price tag lots of options on food here they carried stone crab when they first opened but not anymore lines are long so come early decor is neat and the desserts were probably the least impressive out of all the food
  absolutely wonderful great salad bar with lots of unusual selections wonderful cuts of meat i loved the chicken breast wrapped in bacon and the lamb no need to get dessert the only bad thing is that you really have no idea how much food you ve eaten because they just keep bringing and keep bringing until you ve eaten so much you could explode it took me ten minutes to digest enough just so that i could stand up without passing out will definitely go again
  i absolutely love this restaurant i ve been there twice and it was great both times in fact on my last visit we actually planned on eating at a different place down the road which i hear has a great burger we sat down had a beer and decided to head over to the dowry to eat instead
  i ll start by saying dw and i love piero s our first experience with piero s was in 2009 and it could not have been better food was excellent and service was spot on during our visit to las vegas last week we returned a table of 6 entrees all around two bottles of wine the food was excellent and served on time the service however was very poor water glasses went unfilled half way through the meal found out when we received the bill that rather than ask bottled water or tap they poured bottled and tried to stick us with the 11 up charge i had to call the watier back after our appetizers arrived to order the first bottle of wine i ordered the second when the entrees arrived bottom line the food is still 4 to 5 stars but the service on our recent visit was 2 star thus the rating
  every time i m in a asian restaurant customer service is something i don t expect it almost goes hand in hand asian restaurant bad customer service pho kim long has bad customer service it s expected so i won t dwell on it the first time i came i was with a party of 5 one of my buddies got a hot bowl with cold soup how that happens i can only imagine i tried the pho i asked for egg noodles and got rice noodles i then asked the waiter where my egg noodles were he replied with are you sure you ordered egg noodles i was there just yesterday and i must say that the pho isn t all that great i had pan fried noodles and i received a plate that was drenched in sauce when my pan fried noodles are drenched in sauce there really isn t a point to order pan fried noodles i ve had the chicken teriyaki and it was okay teriyaki madness makes just as good of a chicken teriyaki as pho kim long i notice this place is voted best in vegas however it must be voted by non asian people as this restaurant is full of non asians and even the asians that review this place don t give it a good review
  friendly staff great first impression
  this place is too good this is not a place to pass up you have not had this stuff before the chicken is awesome i cover mine in green sauce no idea what that stuff is but it is spicy and delicious the cilantro rice the fried plantains and the canary beans are my go to sides the green beans are good too it s not pricey but not super cheap either bottom line is that it s worth the money i usually order a quarter chicken and two sides plenty of food but it is so good you may want more also the patio is pretty cool with the plants growing around it and all the staff is nice and friendly it s not far from uptown and is good for either lunch or dinner
  might be my fav sushi place here so far i ve been on the search for a solid sushi place and the review lead us here i got the popcorn shrimp and hubby got the california the popcorn shrimp was yummy and just enough to satisfy first impression can t wait to try more price 4 5 average but great for happy hour food 5 5 good overall 4 5 i ll be able to see if it dwarves five stars after a few more visits
  food was average we had a quesadilla and a burger quesadilla was good burger wasnt great not much flavor and a dry bun the reason for the low rating vs average was because of 2 things one of the waiters dropped a cup that had the liquid flying all over us she looked at us and didnt say a thing and acted like nothing happened second the lady at the bar was serving beers that she wiped the glasses with her hand becase she was overpooring and spilling on the outside of the glass that is just gross
  my wife and i have been going to firehouse subs for the past 2 1 2 years i usually order the new york steamer which was excellent not in my last visit it seems that firehouse subs has changed its meat vendor the corned beef in the sandwich looked more like ham than corned beef and it was tasteless my wife also commented that the ham in her sandwich was sweeter than it used to be it looks like we will not be patronizing firehouse subs any longer
  if you a mac and cheese lover then you ll love it here a little out of the way from the center of monkland but worth the extra few blocks down while we were sitting down and enjoying grilled cheese sandwich which i found not too greasy and a good portion there was a take out order happening for a party great idea and the mac and cheese bowls are perfect also tried the tater tots wow fantastic the potatoes and mashed with just enough cheese fried to perfection don t pop the first one in you mouth you might not burn yourself and not enjoy the rest
  this is a great spot to grab a bite to eat before the movie typical panda express free wifi
  greasy spoons unite great menu cool vibe good service and good beers i was amazed at how efficient these guys are they must lead the restaurant world in ratio of patrons served grill square footage a great spot don t come here on a diet though my meal soaked through the paper plate and left a visible grease puddle on the counter top psst the grit cakes are tasty and absorb the flavors of the meal but they are extremely greasy
  incredibly flavorful tasty broth with generous portions of meat got the 21 i also got the vermicelli bowl combo with fried egg roll pork and it was awesome generous portions that it serves as two meals for me i ve had the vermicelli bowl at mai lang another viet place in henderson and pho saigon 8 is much better service its fast but don t expect too much from it it s really bare bones take your order refill your water that s about it they re not rude by any means though just business
  the food was damn good i can t stress it enough so i won t the atmosphere reeks if third world luxury but that s a good thing you judgemental american assholes our server was very courteous and friendly and have my party advice on other things to do when we return from vegas i would recommend this place if you love vietnamese food ban lo dit
  i love to get my crab on at the crab corner sometimes i m in the mood for good ol basic crab no garlic no crazy spicy sauces just good ol tasty steamed fresh maryland blue crab i have been here twice now for the 2 special on tuesday and thursday and plan on coming back often not only are the crabs deeee licious but the artery clogging goodies hush puppies fried oysters and fried calamari are tasty too wash it down with a refreshing 2 beer and life is good they also have other seafood items such as crawfish and lobster which i plan to try on my next visit i have tried the steamed shrimp and personally it wasn t my favorite it is family owned and the staff is awesome the fountain drinks are self serve but when it isn t that busy the staff will come by and refill them for you and they always make sure that you have everything you need to enjoy the crab picking experience hammer bucket plenty of napkins lemons etc they are some of the friendliest bunch i have ever met they definitely know their crab heck they have been doing it for years as a seafood wholesaler to the local las vegas restaurants and recently opened their own restaurant fall of last year and i am so glad that they did because i love to get my crab on
  best korean restaurant near campus clean delicious kind close to real korean traditional food
  went to sutton house this week used to go to picassos all the time so first visit since changed names service was great but the place just really looks run down paint peeling and dirty the table even looked dirty and was sticky ordered a pizza and it was ok nothing like the pizza i remembered from picassos days it looked great when brought to table was very thick but unfortunately the crust was bland and the pizza wasnt very tasty maybe just an off night
  good place to get good food i got the crazy alfredo and it certainly was a good helping of it the bread was also really good i d have come again to try other items so i could give a more detailed review but from what i tried the food was good service was great
  we were the only ones in the restaurant on a sunday night yet each roll we ordered took 20 30 minutes to complete we were also served water straight from the tap and had a very difficult getting ahold of a waiter waitress the food was good but i was not impressed with the overall experience
  very good left very happy full so good all plates where finished
  this place always has a line so i expected to have an amazing breakfast boy was i disappointed our server wasn t very warm or friendly no greeting or menu tour when she approached the table she said ok what can i get you when i told her our group needed another minute she made a face and was clearly annoyed i m not sure what this place is known for breakfast burritos pancakes i had the greek omelette which was awful the eggs were overlooked the best part was the toast hash brown were greasy and tasted like oil
  i love me some fresh farm food this place is soooo good the coffee is legit surprisingly fairly priced i got the san diegan which was so good add avocado if you want to take it to the next level also tried the blueberry white chocolate chip coffee bread so delicious the only thing about this place that wasn t so stellar was that it was packed inside so we had to sit outdoors in the heat with no fan or misters it was almost unbearable
  ate there yesterday i had the machaca fish tacos and they were delicious and served very quickly i added the shredded cabbage and some other cabbage that was more like coleslaw if i lived in phoenix i would try other stuff on the menu it was also inexpensive which is nice definitely will go there next time i m in phoenix and in that area
  this buffet is amazing they have such a great variety of quality foods my favorites were the truffle mac n cheese crab legs shrimp cocktail yellow tail italian sausage peach cobbler i highly recommend this buffet to anyone be sure to come hungry
  very friendly good service great prices lots of variety and different kinds of japanese food will come back and try the lunch menu next time
  tried the late night menu at the bar tonight awesome food awesome prices service was on point thanks to dustin i greatly appreciate the industry discount for restaurant employees we ll be back soon to try the full menu
  my whole family had the buffet it was delicious i normally do not like buffets but the food was fabulous i highly recommend this place
  we ve dined here a number of times in jan 11 jody was a superstar waitress we had breakfast lunch breakfast eggs benedict coconut pancakes both were heavenly lunch fish and chips chinese chicken salad large portions flaky dinner rolls with creamy butter
  most complaints here seem centered on lack of outlets and uncomfy chairs or bad chai lattes oh well the coffee here is great it is a coffee place hand tamped espresso my usual choice is the best i ve tried in the city cash only free wifi most baked goods made on site and very good outdoor patio is great clean restrooms if you want good coffee this is the place if you want a couch and an outlet there are two starbucks within walking distance
  went with reservations for 7 of us were seated promptly and our waiter jeremy was a delight he made several personal recommendations and we were not disappointed loved loved loved this place all the food we had was delicious the poached egg and pork belly was amazing i also had the loin filet with mushrooms and the brussels with walnuts both were sooooo good i d give this place 10 stars if i could best food i ve had in a long time i will definitely return when i m in vegas again think i might even try the one in san diego now
  a lengthy drive from my home in chandler but worth it in large shopping center easy parking staff is friendly and efficient with good service sports bar atmosphere with several large flat screens a well stocked bar and adjacent dining room tables and seating was clean and comfortable we ordered a large shrimp and octopus cocktail a 5 star dish loaded with the seafood crunchy cucumber tomato juice etc very tasty and filling and only 13 and bacanora described as shrimp in mildly spiced cheese sauce served with rice potato slices and salad a 3 star dish 14 with 6 medium shrimp despite the fact that the menu photo had twice as many shrimp and no spiciness at all we drank the house margarita 6 as it was happy hour 3 6pm also had the house wine at 3 50 a glass we closed with sopapillas with powdered sugar and honey only average we will return to try their fish looked and smelled pretty good
  this was a very pleasant surprise better than i expected very authentic italian good that reminded me of home new york the meatballs and eggplant parmigiana were like my mom used to make delicious the cannoli was to die for my kids loved it too
  incredible love their use of local products to make delicious food my group had outstanding service from all staff members which made our experience even better than our enjoyment of the amazing food
  i have a love hate relationship with this place we had a 8 person group lunch because of their renowned 12 ayce sushi and appetizers for eight people we ordered a boat load of sushi sadly they didn t send out the sushi in a boat just a plain plate the point was to order enough to eat but not waste any food so they would not charge us due to some reason we were sent 4 extra rolls we didn t order this was either done maliciously or just confusion among the chef i ll never know but it was a painful last 4 rolls for eight of us i would recommend this place more if they didn t send extra food they would charge for side note their bathroom is really nice
  had three hours to kill before catching plane back to kc and had my nephew and his wife pick a spot close to airport the vig was their choice it was sunday at 4pm 3 margaritas that were great i had posole others has phad thai and mac cheese food service and atmosphere were very nice i d go back
  you must try the chicago dog delicious being in az it s not that often that you can find an authentic chicago dogs but trust me they do it right here also if you like gooey yummy processed nacho cheese like i can t get enough of i seriously crave this stuff their cheese fries are perfect hot salty fries drowning in nacho cheese is normally a special order request for me but here it just comes that way which makes me love higley hot dog that much more just remember that they have odd hours and only take cash
  oh my goodness everything was fantastic from the service to the wine to the dinner had the filet and was cooked perfectly with fantastic flavor must go to
  we ordered the campfire combo with the shrimp cocktail and salads with the prime rib the salad was very good with fresh greens and chilled well the shrimp was pretty large and the sauce was very good the prime rib was very good cooked just right and juicy with the right seasoning we had the cheesecake for dessert and it was pretty large and very creamy management came by to check at our table as well as others service was good and there was a crowd waiting suggest you make reservations just in case
  7 99 all you can eat lunch buffet mon fri is one of the best options for lunch in chandler the jerk chicken is really good the talapia is good not a fan of the plantains here on the menu the curry goat is great call ahead if you can because it takes about 15 minutes to prepare takeout food
  we had dinner at le cirque last night and let s start off by saying that the food was terrific the service well that s a completely different story to recount everything that went wrong would go on too long for anyone to bother to read it started out with the two of us being seated squeezed between two tables such that i was bumped into a half dozen times by servers for the next table we assumed that there was good reason for this initially but after a while it was clear there was no good reason why they couldn t have seated us somewhere else then no one came to even ask if we wanted something to drink before asking for our orders we were looking forward to a nice meal and we both decided to have the degustation menu with wine pairings without running through all six courses there was at least one significant problem with each course i was brought the wrong dish for one my wife was brought the wrong wine for another etc and they could never seem to get the timing of the wine down with respect to the food we went from getting the wine for one course 20 minutes before the food arrived to getting the food before the wine got there at all for the next even when they began to sense that we were getting irritated it seemed that they were too hopelessly disorganized to be able to get to correct the situation it would be nice to able to experience the food at le cirque under better circumstances but i can t imagine going back there any time soon and i certainly could not recommend it to anyone else addendum to their credit the gm of le cirque contacted me to apologize for the bad experience and asked for the opportunity to make it up to us no telling when we will be back in vegas though
  this place has a beer cave seriously that s what they call it we got to go in and select the beer of our choice from shelves and shelves of single bottles everything from bud to hoegaarden to chimay and back again so many beers i ve never even heard of anyway they have hot dogs too soooo many choices i came with a group and we all easily satisfied our hot dog cravings i had the veggie dog with cheese tomatoes and dill pickles and it was so so yummy everyone else was thrilled with their dogs as well we also got cheese fries with ranch dipping sauce fried zucchini and onion rings and heart attacks just kidding but damn what a greasy meal of awesomeness
  this is my go to place if i don t make pizza at home the staff is very friendly but the bartenders are usually up selling way too much pizza is good from a topping point of view but the dough crust could use some aging meaning flavor i d hope they would make the dough a day before and let it retard overnight this creates the best bread or pizza please improve you have a lot of competition in charlotte
  love love loved my husband son and i got to come eat here today we are originally from iowa and moved to tucson 5 years ago happy joe s happens to be one of the restaurants we miss terribly we had heard that happy joe s had opened in gilbert and we were up in phoenix we walked in and first off i ran into three gals i went to high school in muscatine iowa from over 10 years ago seriously what are the odds the customer service was incredible and immediately we ordered a taco pizza and blt pizza personally taco is my fave and blt is my hubby s i was so delighted our pizza came and it was on point the blt was delicious and my husband was so pleased we also got the chance to meet the owners they are wonderful i am so happy for them and want to say thank you for bringing happy joe s to the southwest we have missed it for those of you who aren t familiar with taco pizza it is amazing and if you want something traditional i promise the pepperoni will not disappoint they layer the pepperoni until the whose pizza is covered their sausage is delish too i am a huge fan and so excited this is here
  not impressed with this ra i have eaten many times at the ra downtown san diego and a few times in scottsdale this location i have tried 3 times the rolls are good but pricy the last time i was there the roll was super fishy smelling and not good today i had a bento box lunch special and the chicken teriyaki was so freezer burned and dry it was practically un edible i had two pieces and quit the rest of the box wasn t fresh the salad was rusted and bruised and the potsticker was old and dried out i give them a solid f on this box atmosphere is nice the service is good and attentive overall for the price i will go someplace else
  top notch pizza with plenty of red or white options nice charming patio seating area looks like it was converted from a house just came back from italy and this place is just as good or better than pizza places there
  underwhelmed by the beer enjoyed the vibe on the back patio eh could have skipped it and enjoyed another bar more
  really good food good service and fairly prompt seating had the crepes and the wife had a dutch baby both were really tasty this is our second time here and will definitly come again
  just ate at this pei wei location for the first time tonight and i was impressed was spotless service was prompt and the food was flavorful and fresh no need to go into details as its all been stated below and most people know what they will get on the menu at a pei wei it s pf changs faster cheaper and more casual sibling i love the spicy thai chicken wraps the caramel chicken signature dish the caramel chicken is spicy and reminds me of the classic general tso plate at chinese restaurants the crab dumplings are also delicious as are the pork egg rolls i also like the asian beer selection the manager at this location is doing a great job the place was busy the phone was ringing off the hook and the line was 5 6 deep most of the time and yet they still pumped out some damn good food with attentive service will stop back when i am on this side of town
  been here about 3 times during the last 2 weeks both times were either a fri night or sat night during march madness so there were a ton of people the first time we came we ordered beers and appetizers when the food came out the chips that came with the spinach dip were stale it also came with bread which was fine the next time we came we ordered pizza and pretzel bites and the food wasn t like we remembered it a while back the pizza was super dry and well done and the pretzel bites which i remember were really good was served differently and tasted different we also had one server in the beginning of the night and then never saw her again and i guess some other server took over this was just confusing because we weren t sure if our server was coming back or who was taking our table section over we came one more time just for a few beers and as we were sitting for a while no one came by the table so we just decided to order our drinks at bar and bring them back to the table i m giving 3 stars for the service which is not consistent as well as the food quality which is not consistent either the happy hour is not bad though and at least they have a few more food options available then most bars we also like the atmosphere here
  i wasn t expecting to be impressed but i was normally when i see a high traffic expensive restaurant adjacent to a mall i m skeptical but today i was hungry and didn t want junk the posted menu seemed inspired so i went in for a solo lunch at the bar very clean eating here but they truly bring the flavor and you will not leave hungry excellent choice for lunch or dinner started with pellegrino and black coffee the bartender was friendly and helpful i like exploring the different methods of cooking chicken tortilla soup so i started with a small cup of that normally i prefer a clear strong broth with lots of chicken and cilantro seasons version is creamy and thick the fresh cilantro is there as is the roasted bits of chicken really liked that but it was almost too thick for me there were a lot of tortilla strips on top as well if that s what you like you will love this version the flavor is very good the tuna tartare starter was the star and had i known i d be fuller from the heavy soup i d have made it my lunch entree i was expecting sliced tuna but what i got was so much better they serve diced raw tuna over a bed of avocado wasabi mousse that has a thin layer of pineapple salsa the whole thing is molded like a larger sized tuna fish can to give you an idea of the size it is served with a cone of extra crispy spicy flat breads i loved everything about this dish for my lunch entree i ordered the red mole beef brisket tacos with lettuce wraps rather than tortillas they give you the choice there are three ample tacos to this dish served with sides of cilantro verde sauce and red mole chile sauce these tacos were amazing i had to take my time as i was full from the tuna very good experience definitely going back
  favorite hole in the wall for burgers and fries never had a bad meal there perhaps a little pricey but worth it to me anyway
  really really overrated and soon tourists will have the pleasure in paying a 30 premium at the palms the best story i have is from a late night dinner apparently they have 2 late night menus one in chinese with english translation the second is in english apparently the english menu is much more in price i can t remember exactly but my friend s mom had to ask the waiter why we were charged more the waiter responded that we didn t ask for the other menu and therefore were going to be charged the non chinese price he seemed to not care after about 10 minutes of going back and forth my friend s mom persistence won out and we got the chinese price which was at least a 30 discount they were pretty rude and it never ceases to amaze me how rude my people can be they ll straight out try to hustle you and when you call them out on it they ll keep defending it on another occasion at dim sum a friend of mine saw one of the employees heat the item in the microwave as they were walking through the restaurant the food here is average at best i never make an effort to go here unless i am being treated
  i attended here with my daughter no kids menu and the staff seemed annoyed when i asked i should have checked out on yelp before we went in it was lunch so they were really busy we ordered the hummus and pita chips which my daughter gobbled up immediately we also had a chicken shwarma salad and a gyro wrap the salad had way too much oregano on it and the chicken was totally dried out and the wrap had a really weird dressing on it but the gyro meat was great my daughter loved the strawberry smoothie decent for lunch but doubt we will come back just because of costumer service the only person that even looked like they wanted to be working their was the smoothie operator
  easily one of the best custards i ve ever had one of the best parts of being an adult is eating custard for breakfast i definitely recommend them for your late night snack or morning custard like me the food was pretty good too but i d stick with what they re good at and that s cold delicious deserts
  found three hairs in two different dishes bun was waaaay too sweet too will never go back
  this is my go to place for sushi they have recently expanded so they have a bit more room paul has done a great job on the expansion but the sushi is wonderful and fresh they have some early bird specials just a class place with a class owner and staff food is fantastic and always a good deal i have probably been here some 50 times and it has always been great each and every time
  i love their italian sub here so good on top of that it s a very clean place with great customer service they are quick with getting your meal out to you and the food is always fresh
  my favorite taqueria in charlotte so far shame on you yelpers here for not finding and posting this place yet my torta oaxaquena was great and full of that stringy cheese that makes it so special my pastor taco had pineapple chunks mixed in and was pretty solid as well my recommendation get a taco and a torta eat half the torta and the taco for lunch dinner and save the other half of the torta for an excellent breakfast
  try a rugelach made from scratch bakery family style quiches for take away daily specials for breakfast pleasant outdoor seating if you don t mind the parking lot almost always busy for good reason mostly friendly staff family business delicious breakfasts sandwiches and soups counter service only my favorite baked item is the ham and cheese croissant my only complaint worst espresso i ve had in a while
  stopped on the way down to la from utah to have dinner everything tasted good and we liked the atmosphere
  meh i was visiting from nyc when i ate here before a show at the brillobox the beef pho was sub par food took about 10 minutes to arrive when it did the beef was already cooked through that s a big no no in my book i could hardly make out the star anise in the broth and the bean sprouts had seen better days the framed ppg review says tram s has the best pho in pittsuburgh if that s actually true then the state of pho in pittsburgh is in bad shape i also tried the vegetarian satay that my wife ordered and it was pretty decent so plus one star for having vegetarian soups and more importantly actually trying to make it good it beat the pants off of the veggie viet place on 6th st in nyc i kinda have my doubts about their interpretation of vegetarian though i kept that to myself as others have noted the decor is kinda dumpy and the guy that took my order was surly but i wonder if there s some kind of inverse halo effect going on here some hole in the walls are just that a hole in the wall also 8 for pho does not make for hole in the wall pricing
  one of my favorite places to hit happy hour in old town this along with the adjacent cafe zuzu at the hotel are great places to show friends from out of town the whole hotel is vintage and trader vics is a polynesian paradise food is comforting but eclectic ambiance is awesome
  very good service and very budget friendly menu without sacrificing taste and flavor when you don t want to cook noodlehead pgh my favorite dish is street noodle 1 the crunchy breaded chicken over the asian noodles is delicious if your not a fan of spice i would recommend a level one as far as spice level my girlfriend loves the pad thai in my opinion the only down fall is the limited menu but some may like not having to many choices
  i went there for sunday brunch wanted to know how good it was on the yelp we bought vip passs for 12 00 for faster line and champagne or mimosa i really like the fact they offer vip passes it was worth it my husband had foot problem the food was pretty good good asian food section the service was pretty good and their geleto was sooo goood
  i have to give props to my friend for recommending this restaurant the majority of us tried the omakase menu and was surprised at the quality of fish although i would consider the food japanese fusion they did not stray too far from the japanese theme the three dishes that stood out was the hamachi trio chu toro ginger soy sauce and spiced crunchy garlic as part of the sashimi duo and of course the foi gras as part of the niku dish unfortunately i can t remember the names of the sake we had but i would definitely recommend that you try a few i can always appreciate good service for example they provided us with a more expensive sake at a cheaper price just because they ran out of the one we requested overall omakase is worth the 120 price tag just don t be like the party next to us and overpay for california rolls explore your palate
  2 8 miles is too far from you then take that delivery service off from yelp you are misleading customers
  love this place ambiance awesome food outside seating area fantastic coffee what could be bad
  i love love love this place the food is amazing and they also will do requests my friend lived in thailand for quite some time and fell in love with a certain dish they didn t have on the menu but they made it for her anyway they are always very nice and considerate even though they are always swamped the restaurant itself is tiny so i always just order for pick up but you have to try the thai tea it s awesome i m slowly working my way through the entire menu and haven t been disappointed with anything yet also i have some family members that are incredibly psychotic about the cleanliness of restaurants and this place passes muster they are clean and tidy
  my dad lived in montreal back in the 70 s and every time he comes to visit here he gets roughly eight dozen bagels if he knows he s getting bagels from st viateur he ll often borrow my mom s minivan to drive up to montreal to make sure they ll all fit we ve had problems at the border a lot of us agents who have never had the fortune of going to st viateur think we re smuggling drugs amongst all the bagels but no there s really just nearly 100 bagels in our trunk they re that good
  look for the tiny alphabet blocks and know you re going through the right door finally made it to tuck shop and found it charming the best thing about it is that it s another local gem we had the pork t bone which was very meaty and catfish cakes which were just ok would definitely get something else next time maybe small plates and side friends had chicken and waffles they looked good but didn t make me green with envy
  not good service was sloooooowwwwwwww i mean it wasn t even busy crowded waiter seemed like he forgot our table of 4 s ordered appetizer of shu mai and to close out the bill shu mai was a solid 3 at best everything was tasteless other server kept insisting on giving all our ordered hot steaming pho congee noodle soups on one person to hand out to everyone i mean come on what kind of service is this only positive thing about this place is that they re open at 3am huge disappointment _
  this was a pleasant surprise for airport food yes its pricey but at least its worth it they have killer french press coffee they bring you a big carafe for 2 that makes at least 5 6 cups i ordered the chilaquiles which were tasty and my husband had the mexican omelet the service was really good too since we were in a time crunch they served us pretty quick if in the area again i would definitely come back and try the cochinita pibil witch is supposed to be the house specialty
  the best thing about this place was the sushi lucky break the service was really slow the waiter was nice but by golly he was slow there was also some sort of sushi eating competition announced on a loudspeaker and cheered for mainly by the staff which did not seem to fit with the low lit intimate ambiance of the place the small plate of salmon tacos were incredible i ve never had raw salmon salmon poke in a hard taco shell but i m glad i did it was seasoned well the salmon was fresh and it was just delicious the roll skinny bitch was also splendid no rice but it wasn t missed it was salmon tuna yellow tail spicy crab and avocado wrapped in cucumber fish was fresh and the combination was lovely i would come back again for the food but hopefully the service would be better
  loved this restaurant was a great start to our vacation even though there were 11 in our group they were very quick to accommodate us they were able to put tables together so we could have conversations and provided us with 4 separate checks with no errors the food was great and service was quick we will definitely visit again when we vacation there next year
  i finally had to try this place a week or so ago as friends raved about it and honestly i don t get it they had a lot of option but the food was pretty average with rubbery fries and wings that were smaller tun regular wings and weird serving numbers the food was ok but making a moderately good wing unacceptable was the service they are slow and rude and spent more time thing to each other than the customers and the final strike was the pricing was kind of strange with everything being separate so you end up with average to ok good wings mediocre sides and then they charged a fairly steep price for chicken wings sorry i wanted them to be great but can t say they were
  i try to stay away from 5 star ratings so i waited a few days to write this review first of all re tasking this old church is by far the greatest idea and lends it s self to thoughts of monks making ales in the basement headed here to taste a tapping of cartel s tequila ale that is a hole other review let me just say it is one of the most original brews i have had the pleasure to enjoy they have pork taco s on the happy hour menu at 2 00 each i ordered one with the brew and i could not tell you what made it so good so i finished the brew and ordered another taco to go with brew this will be my go to for tacos so i suggest you try it when you can still get in
  came here for lunch on a thursday with some co workers we left with mixed feelings most of us disappointed and won t be back this place is pretty new it opened in the space that ian s pizza moved out of they spent quite a bit of work to completely redo the interior they attempted to capture the up north feel with lots of cedar wood and country decor there was a gas fireplace in the middle of the dining room which i really liked i got the whitefish hoagie the menu said that all sandwiches were served with a side of sweet mustard cole slaw hmm i don t remember tasting any mustard or any sweetness or anything all it was weak mostly watery cabbage with a touch of cream my sandwich was okay the red pepper aioli didn t stand out i actually thought it was melted cheese until i reviewed the menu just now there wasn t any tartar sauce served the sides are kind of a rip especially the traditional fries they re a 3 add on and they could ve easily been from the frozen section at woodman s foods one of my co workers got the wild boar burger fries and a can of beer his bill was 17 before tip seemed pretty steep for a lunch it d be different if any of the 3 items were standout but they were lacking one co worker had the grilled cheese sandwich with fig jam sliced apples he was really happy with it out of our group of 5 he s the only one that said he d come back
  we went to barrington s for our wedding anniversary on a wednesday night it looked like a geritol fest in the restaurant we wanted to split an entree but the server said they had european sized portions i ate 1 4 of my lamb the carrot cheesecake desert was not good we ate 2 bites and were not offered a refund or substitution never again what a waste of money
  i like to try new places and read other yelp reviews they were right on went for lunch tried to make breakfast but parked in wrong part of cosmo and took a while to find the buffet so lunch it was very cute i like that everything was individually portioned in small pots and little baskets the chinese was in little to go boxes the wings chicken pot pie and bbq short ribs were tasty there are many food options and the chocolate dipped strawberries were the size of my fist no kidding i would definitely recommend this buffet to anyone wanting to try something a little more unique
  great food pecan smoked pork ribs and chicken i am not joking try the chicken salad the onion rings are to die for sauteed green beans are excellent i went thinking it was a bikers divey sports bar yes it is a bikers doctor s on motorcycles more expensive than my acura mdx bar and over 6 tv s with any football game you want to see but they actually cook here the full bar is the center piece of the restaurant and i believe the evening may not be kid friendly we stop here every time we go to charlotte a great food stop for a reasonable price
  my first experience with chutney s was a new year s party with a friend of mine the food itself was very tasty and deligtful in fact my wife an i returned on a first friday to catch the live jazz however let s get to the meat and potatoes of this review one of the things i enjoy eating is the naan bread their naan is prepared in a tandoori oven which gives the bread an excellent consistency and flavor we have had different dishes each visit and they have been very consistent with presentation and taste a few months ago i decided to bring my toastmasters group in for their chef s table if you have not experienced this you are missing a true treat this six course meal will leave you very satisfied and very full the mullitgitawny soup was sublime with its delicate balance of flavors the show stopper was the garlic cauliflower to this date i still run into toastmasters who talk about how good this dish was the 65 chicken is also very tasty i have been relaying these raves back to shilpa the manager and she leaves with a smile on her face the main entrees of choice are very tasty and customers are given a choice of spicy or mild the desserts are pretty tasty as well speaking of shilpa she is a delight to work with i worked very closely with her in setting this up she did everything promised and then some any concerns i had were dealt with in a very professional and expedient manner but even if we don t do the chef s table often we will still return because of the quality of the food and the excellent live jazz that leaves a good note with us
  my trip to union pig chicken was long overdue but when a groupon arrived and reminded me that this was on my must try list i was on it we were seated upstairs and i was immediately intrigued by the fact that i was standing in a bbq joint yet the decor told me i was somewhere else i don t mean this in a bad way it was upscale tasteful kind of minimalist the recycled plastic outdoor wood pseudo picnic tables were a neat touch you know that plasticky faux wood they use at newer playgrounds to make park benches and stuff pretty cool beer selection was very good including some pittsburgh brews on tap and a neat looking specialty drink list we stuck with beer but i d come back to try a specialty drink our waitress was excellent and sat down with us for a few minutes to go over the menu options and provide some recommendations we decided to split a smattering of items to get the full effect 1 fried chicken white meat delicious tender juicy all those good adjectives one would use to describe excellent fried chicken they have a lunch special on this and if i worked closer to east lib i d be all over it 8 for 2 pieces of chicken a drink and a side that s a killer deal for this quality 2 brisket a little slab of goodness it was very tasty served like a little slice of meatloaf of steak but fork tender and pulls apart with a nice little crust on the outside it was good with bbq sauce good with the carolina style vinegar and good by itself mmmm 3 pork shoulder don t get freaked out that it s served in cubes the pork was fantastic i think i liked this better than the brisket it was probably my favorite i mixed the bbq sauce with a little of the habanero sauce for this i could eat a full pound of this straight up no sides 4 mac cheese good not great cheesy and rich for sure but needed a little salt and pepper of which there was none at the table not bad but i wouldn t fill up on this instead of other things 5 cornbread best cornbread i ve ever had my wife almost ordered a second piece to go it tastes like cake she exclaimed with glee it was really really good and quite dense not dry like many other cornbreads i ve had 3 for a slice is a bit steep though overall we were both really impressed with the food and enjoyed the atmosphere to be clear this isn t the kind of bbq place that s all about the sauce they don t have a plethora of sauce options this place is about the meat the sauce is a compliment to it not a cover up for it you re getting a supermodel with a little blush not a back alley hag covered with maybelline i m docking 1 star only due to price not that the food wasn t excellent but for some reason i have a hard time looking at the bill and realizing that it would have cost the same to eat at many other upscale places but instead i got bbq damn good bbq no doubt but i don t know if the upscale bbq thing adds enough for me to warrant the extra bills or enough to make me choose this over other restaurants for my next date night i will say this i was really happy to finally eat somewhere where they clearly wipe down the bbq sauce bottles at the table you have no idea how much bbq bottle crust ruins a meal before it even starts
  an hour and a half of free time 15 minutes away from unlv i ve had japanese curry zen bookmarked ever since having this midnight craving for japanese curry and this satisfied that craving 1 year later i opted for the chicken cutlet my usual and added some medium spices and it was delicious our server greeted us gave us the option to sit there weren t many people there at the time but was packed by the time we left friendly staff and good food will make me a fan any day
  for my first breakfast in montreal i searched yelp for a location not too far from my hotel based on the stellar reviews i headed over to this cafe the wait to order was about 15 minutes but being on vacation and not in a rush the wait didn t bother me so when i was finally able to order i ordered 2 cafe au laits a bagel with cream cheese and a bagel with egg cheese and bacon the bagel with cream cheese came out just fine however the bagel for the bagel egg cheese and bacon was burnt literally black so i asked for another and that one was also burnt but more dark brown with a few areas of black as i don t like to complain i ate it picking off the black burnt parts of the bagel the egg cheese and bacon were all excellent but i m confused as to why my bagel was burnt twice my bill was 16 for 2 coffees and bagel sandwiches yelp let me down with this place the cafes were just ok
  great beautiful low lit romantic atmosphere great staff the owner is still wandering around every night im not sure that is necessary however the food is always excellent and the prices are great as well happy hour at the bar is nice as well
  a highland park satellite of the fabulous enrico s biscotti mothership in the strip district i had the impression they were open only for weekend brunch hopefully that will change as the operation picks up steam they have a lovely dining room that opens to a big outdoor terrace comfortable blackboard painted tables fresh flowers white walls wooden floors menu written on a big chalkboard up front the food is fresh seasonal local with a focus on mediterranean cuisine beautifully presented i had an asparagus and goat cheese omelette with carmelized onions roasted red potatoes and a frise salad with walnuts goat cheese cranberries and balsamic viniagrette basic and yummy my friend had baked polenta swimming in fresh bright marinara we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table we hung out in a downstairs bar area where you can nosh on coffee tea and biscotti while you wait e2 is a great very welcoming new option for brunch in the burgh go and enjoy
  i stopped by to check out the new lucille s for happy hour they are still going through some opening pains that caused the service to be below expectations hopefully the service will improve as the staff gains more experience the highlight was the wedge salad delicious with the crispy smoked bacon bits the irish nachos french fries with cheese were tasty but got soggy as they cooled off the fried green tomatoes were good but the batter broke off of the tomatoes when cut the rib tips and sausage were well prepared but in general i find lucille s bbq sauce too sweet for my taste i also didn t really care for the biscuits with sugar on top finally the happy hour drink choices they have a good selection of skky vodka martinis but i found their happy hour beer selections limited primarily to their house brews
  first stop when i come to vegas bouillabaisse is incredible and they ll make it as spicy as you want the best
  i love the herb box my company previously ordered catering from the north scottsdale location and that s when the addiction began you would have to fight off coworkers for left over s the food is always fresh and delish the ingredients are perfectly placed and you know what your getting is prepared with love there isn t anything on the menu i don t like i am here at least 2 times a week for lunch i keep checking the desserts for the peach and cream tart peach season is coming soon so expect me lurking the whole month of may
  brilliant pork ribs plain and simple this place is in a shopping center that you could easily miss i asked the bartender what was good he suggested a 1 2 rack of pork ribs i added the coleslaw and corn bread the spicy sauce was divine if you do not like spicy this sauce is not for the faint of heart i happen to like my sauce with a kick the coleslaw was very good the cabbage was crunchy and its dressed very nicely my only complaint was the cornbread it had pimento in it not a big fan personal taste other than that the price was very reasonable support this place its rare to find a good barbque place what is good and inexpensive
  i passed by this place a few times and was intrigued i am really happy i went there to eat yesterday kibbeh was deliciously crunchy hummus creamy baba ghanouj real tasty come here if you want real authentic food
  reminds me of good old nyc chinese food the beef was tender the service was outstanding the pork fried rice had lots of pork and that s unusual the food really is top notch
  simply amazing a little over priced on a couple of things but worth it when the entire meal is delicious took the dessert to go so we will see how that goes i would recommend it for sure
  after walking around new york new york and only seeing steak pizza and pasta we were happy to find chin chin pineapple rice was delicious and the the sushi roll was fresh it was exactly what we were looking for
  this is the best carne asada i have ever had it is the embodiment of perfection when it comes to carne asada get extra meat if you order a burrito it s just a dollar more or get a bunch of street tacos they re 1 the quesadilla with carne asada of course is out of this world the line is long on weekend nights especially late i m not sure what the hours are i believe it is just late at night i have waited over an hour for this i have left extremely disappointed when i knew the wait would likely be quite a bit longer than that more than one person has told me that they don t particularly like carne asada in general but this place is out of this world i d give it more than 5 stars
  for breakfast hands down 5 stars wynn is excellent for breakfast but wicked spoon out does them with the attention to the little plates some of the best of the best shrimp cocktail in a little glass with the cocktail sauce in the bottom of glass chocolate covered strawberries rolled in health bar bits fall off the bone bar b q ribs salads on little plates already dressed it s just a very well done breakfast buffet and one i will return to i have only eaten here for breakfast lunch and dinner experience unknown
  went here for the first time recently great decor friendly staff sat inside but the outside dining area looked wonderful the green chili macaroni was good the brussel sprouts were amazing yum yum i had the wedge salad which consisted of a quarter slice of lettuce with all the good stuff surrounding it for 12 they can do better with a bigger wedge hubby had the burger which was good however what is with these places that think they need to forgo the path of the true burger no regular mustard only dijon come on a burger without yellow mustard then they serve some bastardized ketchup how bout just plain old regular ketchup had to request pickles was brought out baby dills that hubby had to slice up to put on his burger really there is a safeway in the same parking lot go buy a bottle of hamburger pickles a jar of yellow mustard for us not so snobby diners the large beer was a 12 oz one charged 6 i had some fancy martini sweet like drink that i had to request mineral water ice for it was so syrupy it was 12 a tiny little glass probably will not return here much better more generous places nearby get over yourselves dc ranch
  this is a great little cafe like place to eat i ve tried just about everything on the menu and never had any complaints their new items like the banh mi and quinoa shrimp salad seem a little far fetched to what they usually serve but hey if it s good what does it matter right i ve had many lunches with long distance friends spending hours refilling our soda tea and cooling down with the free ice cream it s a very relaxing spot get the california club or plain jane potato
  happy hour here i come how can you not love 2 for 1 drinks and fattening bar food i enjoy the pretzel with spicy cheese sauce as my food du jour don t expect haute cuisine it s just a fun place to meet up with your friends after work to drink and chat the food isn t amazing but you re probably just here for the drinks stick to pub grub wings and queso dip are some good options too keep your expectations low and have fun
  this place is delicious the hubby and i shared the spanish omelette bad the whole wheat pancakes the pancakes were perfectly sweet and so tasty i loved the chorizo in the omelette too it wasn t greasy at all i lived their fresh made jams and popovers
  this place is amazing always busy but for obvious reason wish it was bigger but if you go with a party of 2 or 4 you ll be seated fairly fast def try this place out
  i ve been wracking my brains trying to remember the name of this cute cafe and tea room all week i went through elegant endearing elephant and ethereal before stumbling upon julia s s review and remembering it s called ephemeris a lovely old fashioned tea shop they serve tea coffee sandwiches light snacks and homemade cakes the tea is made from leaves and the extensive list includes everything from herbal and fruit teas to builders teas in keeping with the cute and chintzy interior it s served in vintage polka dot and flowery tea pots with china cups forgive me for saying it ephemeris but in keeping with my addiction the hilight of my visit was the freshly ground coffee brewed from freshly roasted beans it smelt and tasted divine
  loved the pink taco if you want great tex mex in las vegas this is the right place if you are familiar with the food at the hula hut in austin tx it has the similar types of spices and tastes the atmosphere is great more like your in a rock bar that serves great food i would come again best regards leroy nellis ii
  yum we were in the area and came in as soon as it opened attentive and friendly service from the adorable waitress i ordered my standard pad thai with tofu and it was delicious i chose a hot spice level and it was definitely hot i enjoy spicy foods and i can handle them but this made me short of breath and it was awesome the lunch special is a really good deal and it comes with a soup and a spring roll we got our food very fast probably because we were the first customers i d come back for sure nice ambience too and by the time we left and hour later the small place was full glad we came early
  i am giving veloce 5 stars for 2 things one this is the best view in all of las vegas you can see from green valley to summerlin the entire strip and everything in between two the surf and turf roll is the best sushi roll i ve ever had thanks to the thin slice of kobe beef carpaccio on top veloce is a bit out of my everyday price range but for a dirty martini with a sexy date on the couch outside it is perfect this is such a fun spot to bring friends on warm summer nights to sit outside enjoy the view and have a couple cocktails
  just the name alone makes me smile like a southern nickname this place can certainly grow on people i didn t have the oppurtunity to try the fried chicken other than a bite hear and there from the girlfriend the burger special i did have was absolutely fantastic sirlion burger on a croissant nuff said service was very energetic and attentive seems like they have hired pretty well in that regard atmosphere is very casual and somewhere in between southern comfort and a little new age i really like it
  a friend i was visiting in charlotte said we had to go by pike s for the sunday brunch while i was down after i arrived that s where we headed as i understand it is in the south end part of the city i was glad he made the suggestion as i and my friends had a great brunch experience the facade is a nice brick one looking like another trendy place to go for eats or to hang out in the city liked how it looked going in once inside you are treated to a interior much more on the old fashioned side as the name suggests great look as an old time soda shop combined with a nice dining area on both sides very welcoming in design and look i liked the atmosphere it gave as i said we went for sunday brunch which is a buffet there man it was some good stuff healthier fare such as fruit cereals or light breads even to scones and a very light coffee cake for more hardcore eaters carnivores and breakfast traditionalists that would be me there are eggs bacon sausage hashbrowns french toast biscuits and gravy grits etc there is also a side station for other main meals faves such as a wonderful beef carved as you come up to ask for it most everything i had was great definitely a three plate brunch for me the grits were a bit thin and my buds were not wild about the green beans but all in all it was a great selection and meal i recommend going by pike s for the sunday brunch buffet good price below 15 bucks as i remember great food and nice staff i will go back
  ny strip and prime rib were done right service was good great location if your going to arena
  i come here probably once a month or every other month service is kind of slow sometimes but i m take slow for fresh food i really want to say thank you to max he was very nice to my outrageous sons who were very loud all over the place that day as i was trying to hurry leave my baby had a mini meltdown down her little foot kicked my newly refilled drink off the table i would normal clean it myself but my sons were just too much that day kids will be kids but they were over doing it i had to go max ended up cleaning it for me which i totally appreciate some may feel its his job but i m an adult plus i was taught growing up you clean up what you mess up thank you here s 5 stars for you
  me and my sister stayed at the luxor and decided to go in and eat oh em gee was the food horrible never again will i ever go back i had the half torta with soup the meat was too mushy and the soup tasted like tomato soup with tortilla chips disgusting my sister felt sick after eating there it doesn t taste like mexican food at all never again do not go there if i could i would leave no stars but i have to leave one
  being a native chicagoan my interest was piqued the staff was very friendly and the place was clean ordered a chicago style hot dog the hot dog was grilled chicago style is steamed as is the bun but the bun was wet and therefore was a soggy pastry mess the fries were mediocre at best the dipping sauce was very good needs some changes in the food preparation and pray that portillos does not open in the area
  the service was great and the prices were more reasonable than you d expect i had the pasta trio it had the best gnocchi i ve ever had
  lunch at tex tubbs was a treat service was warm and attentive food was tasty and generous in portion and the atmosphere was casual but inviting the fajitas came out sizzling hot and were flavorful with just the right kick i d definitely recommend them a huge thanks to jessalyn my server for a fantastic experience 5 stars to y all thanks for the great afternoon break
  can t believe i never got around to writing this review i have been here a few times including mother s day prix fix the atmosphere here is very inviting and warm it is an excellent setting for date night or for special occasions and the service has always been exceptional rarely do i tip the busperson above and beyond the waiter but i usually drop a few bucks directly to them for their assistance with the dinner here at roy s they really go above and beyond making sure you need nothing the food is always great i have had some very very good dishes here but what they excel in imo is seafood roy s has some of the best tasting fish dishes i have consumed and has prepared me my most favorite sea scallops to date whether it is full fillet of fish or shrimp and scallop dishes you can t go wrong only thing that is a bummer is the prices seems like i never leave here without spending over 200 with tip and drinks for two but i always leave with a smile on my face and a memorable food journey so i will continue coming
  well they have done it again durant s is the coolest steakhouse in phoenix let s start with entering through the kitchen yes i know everyone talks about it but i love that the staff greets you like you are a regular even if you are not next the red velvet walls the booths the low lighting the old school photos and an actual phone booth all fling you back to the 50 s when the place opened and when people dressed up for dinner oh and the bar that full length bar with rounded ends and the huge padded arm rest that always makes me think that after my meal i could take a quick nap before dessert the bar is actually where i prefer to eat dinner don t roll your eyes until you try it on to the food i am not one to tell someone what steak they should choose so let s just say they are all great what i am good at is telling people is what the must have items are on the menu on the top of my list are the onion rings these are the best onion rings on the planet and yes i have gone there just for those and drinks the stone crab is a must if it is even available on the night you go oh and of course save room for the strawberry shortcake i mean it one last thought if you appreciate a great cocktail and i mean cocktail manhattan old fashioned martini etc that is made correctly with the right amount of each ingredient and has the correct garnish this is your place for happy hour
  surprisingly very good and this is considering the fact that i m comparing it to rita s i absolutely love rita s the flavors are not artificial tasting and the custard is delicious try the pumpkin custard ample parking in lot located in small strip mall you will notice that they have a truck that you can have for special events fundraisers etc will definitely be back
  ok its in a strip mall but what isnt i absolutely love this place for indian food the staff is friendly and the service is fast the madras chicken melts in your mouth we seriously lapped up every bit of the gravy with our naan this wasn t the only dish that was fantastic everything was very good definitely one of the best places for indian food in the valley east and west
  i read reviews on yelp all the time but it takes something special to cause me to write one green s food absolutely blew me away the flavors and combinations are just amazing i was in phoenix on business and ate here 5 times in 3 days the sandwiches are the best vegan sandwiches i ve ever eaten and the salads are great too friendly staff and a cool atmosphere top it off
  im giving ra sushi s happy hour 4 stars based on price the price of sushi was really really good i believe 3 25 for a few rolls we got now on a regular price menu i would be erked to pay 6 50 the rolls were really loose everytime i used my chop sticks to pick them up i about squeezed all the way through the roll although the rolls did have a good taste and they were fresh what i mean by that is they re cool not warm or room temp the atmosphere is great as well as the ambiance if you want some cheap sushi this is definitely the spot just do the happy hour before you decide on doing dinner to see if it meets your standards i would be ticked to get that sushi at full price
  amazing friendly wait staff that i can always rely on to make good recommendations i love the vibe here and would recommend it to everyone especially for their amazing happy hour drink prices full sized cocktails for 5 decent price for such a nice place
  food is great but horrible service all around i came with my mom and we sat at the bar it took them 10 minutes to even notice we were there after she brought us our drinks which one was incorrect and i had to wave her down a hundred times she went back to the bar and didn t bother to ask if we wanted to eat she came back with the new drink 5 minutes later and was about to walk away until i said can we order i orded an appetizer and after we finished the appetizer i waited a little to see if she was going to refill our drinks but she didn t i had to go and get her so finally my mom got up and asked for a different server and so they got us another in which was rude as well we will never come back here again
  great food amazing service coffee is very good it s all espresso not filter or brewed no refills just awesome coffee drinks roomie atmosphere sunny friendly conversational noise level and ambience
  probably better off skipping this place next time i visit but had to see the place bc a huge church turned brewery is a really cool concept a few of the beers here are ok the bartender initially was sort of a douche either he confuses rudeness with having a personality or he was nearing the end of his shift and just dgf and it fails to reflect well on the establishment the girl that took over for him 20 minutes later was much more personable a couple of tasty beers here but fewer than other breweries in this town what is really absurd is that the bar keeps i talked to completely agree that the beers suck but the place opts to serve the shit rather than dump it and just brew something better tried a beer sampler four regular beers and four seasonals i liked the celestial gold and the pipe organ pale ale the thunderstyle i think that was the name ipa some licorice mint concoction sucked the early summer brew confessional kolsch again i think that was the name were not my cup of tea behind the bar was a mess wet floors a clusterfuck of tangled hoses multiple dish glass racks stacks all over the place wet floors dusty display of glasses just a general unsanitary under managed feel that made me my bro think things like the kitchen which we cannot see would only be worse off eff it we wound up ordering a little food very little food spinach feta gouda dip that was pretty ok
  its a great place both me and my wife thought it had a great summer feel in the 50s what s nice about it is that it has a madison vegetarian twist if we would ve been hungrier the pies looked amazing but our bellies had reached their capacity overall quality its traditional american diner feel w a twist of madison great spot for a sit down lunch on a road trip
  i was recommended by some acquaintances for this restaurant and i would have to say it is overall just ok but not something very specail you walk in here and it is definitely a modern vietnamese fusion restaurant that attracts mainly the younger crowd with their style and taste of their dining room i do like it im 25 years old but personally its not what i expect when i like some vietnamese food would rather have some average spot with no style serv me some good flavorful pho for their food most yelpers here probably will not agree they probably had an off day but i had the ox tail pho and it was just mediocre some of us has the same thing and others had some appitizers and other kinds of pho i forgot which ones what i was amazed from my pho was the oxtail itself two giant pieces of ox tail thats probably enough to feed a lion fell right off the bone as im picking and eating it was very easy to eat it though the broth with the pho completely bland to me when i have vietnamese food in boston the broth is usually at its bold flavors in restaurants i go to but this one was just so disappointing to me my mother also had pho i dont know what its called but its just simple slices of meat but she didnt eat any because it looked like it was all fat im aware prime brisket is 50 fat but this seem to be 75 meh also had some appitizers soft shell crab was pretty good pork belly bun was as well but we had the leaf wrapped beef tasted bland as well for their service definitely on point i was with embarassing asian elders who doesnt know the vibe of respect of talking too loud and sounding rude all the time the server i had was definitely cooperating and it was great it didnt seem she was bothered we got everything we ordered and such for the money its just okay i can pay 15 for ox tail pho and i would definitely try lobster because it s defintiely something new but for now i would have to give this 3 stars for just being a mediocre place hope they do something about the broth though
  one of the better breakfast places in cu area that we ve found had a bit of a wait went around 11am on a weekend flavored coffee was awesome the french toast was above average the skillet we ordered was good as well though we ve had better not in cu
  this along side of its big brother next door are the best restaurants in vegas the food is mind blowing service is as good as it gets the atmosphere is top notch one thing about the menu everything is good but if you want to taste the world s greatest mashed potatoes you will find them there if you hit it big and have enough extra money in your pocket to either buy used kia or have dinner treat yourself and go here its insanely expensive if you are a foodie like me it is well worth it does not get much better than this
  it s good got the pad thai lunch special i never get anything else in thai restaurants but it wasnt as tasty as the other pad thai s ive had before i loved palee s crown but apparently they closed i guess they use a little less sweet sauce and more diced tofu than i would have liked since my choice of meat to add in was fried tofu tofu overload but honestly it was edible and wasnt horrible nice place ambiance and all i wish i had time to eat in and have their soup of the day that comes with the lunch special
  my boyfriend went crazy on restaurant com and ordered gift certificates so we decided to give it a try i have to say that it wasn t the best steak i ve ever had but certainly one of the priciests however i was pleasantly surprised the steak was cooked just how i like it and i overindulged with the fries we had a pre fixe menu and there was plenty of food all around i ll definitely go back i hear the happy hour is also good
  my son and i were going to the bike cellar next door when we saw this place decided what the hay let s check it out we ordered the breakfast pizza which was pretty good the service i will say was great the general manager had excellent customer service skills and was very cheerful and friendly the atmosphere is very cozy great location right off the light rail and bus station stop would like to try one of there salads next time
  we came here for a dinner wanted to go to the bellagio buffet but the line was too long and it was sub par neither of us enjoyed our meals and that s not so good when you re forking out 150 bucks i ordered a martini and what i got was basically a glass filled to the brim with nail polish remover and some festive olives honestly this drink was so nasty i would have rather drank rubbing alcohol i would have rather drank nyquil blegh
  i used to eat a swish a lot when it first opened i moved away and just recently came back to vegas i was looking forward to having dinner and went to the old location on sahara hopefully they were bought by someone other than the owner at spring mountain as my dinner last night was sub par the meat was ok however the veggies looked horrible and this was not the same quality that i received previously i also noticed that a few of the employees were korean nothing against koreans but part of what made swish so good was that it was authentic japanese style i ll have to try the location at spring mountain and report back
  i wish i would have read megan p s review before i decided to cancel my dinner reservations because i was offered a comp dinner at beso two of my girlfriends and i were walking around fashion show mall as a promoter approaches us to ask if we d like to go to eve nightclub that night we wanted to go to haze and xs so we declined the promoter by the way his name is andre offers us a comp dinner at beso eva longoria s restaurant at crystals mall i guess what s the catch right is there a comp limit and we have to pay after we hit the limit no it s a set dinner he sets everything up and promises he ll even walk us into haze and xs afterwards which i actually believed here s a review for andre he tells you to call him when you re at the restaurant to get you seated well he doesn t even pick up or return text messages basically i never even see him again since he approached us at fashion show mall he never came to give us our bottle of campagne that he promised either and he never shows up to walk us into haze or set us up for xs on top of that he gave my number to other promoters for lavo without letting me know i guess these promoters get paid by the number of girls they can pull but i ve definitely dealt with more reliable promoters that actually keep their word here s a review for the meal we had a party of 9 girls we ordered cocktails 15 and 4 soda iced tea etc i ordered the ginger cosmo and i d say i d definitely not order that off the menu again it was highly recommended by our waitress by the way i didn t think any of the drinks were that great as i sipped my friend s drinks the meal included the following keep in mind 9 girls 1 3 tiny portions of guac and chips guac was ok but i ve had better and i felt like the chips were a little stale 2 2 plates of caesar salad i mean you can t really go wrong with caesar salad but i don t think the lettuce was very fresh 3 2 plates of steak and potatoes the portion on each plate was enough to probably feed 1 person so imagine 4 to 5 girls sharing the portion for 1 person i mean yes it s vegas and we want to look good in our dresses but we also want to eat so we don t get wasted yes the steak was good the whole 4 bites that i ate it s literally 1 slice per person as it s 5 pieces pre cut i m sure this meal would have been better if we actually paid to dine at beso but to be honest promoters should just tell people that it s a comp taste sampling and to come eaten i was on my phone yelping the nearest fast food restaurant for us to eat more but this comp meal only takes reservations 9 9 30 10 they just want you to go to eve club even if you don t want to so it doesn t really allow time to eat meal 2 before trying to get into a club the promoter promised to walk you right in but goes mia i definitely would have rather paid to eat elsewhere and i will probably never step foot into beso again you win this time but i hope i win in the long run with this yelp review
  i m always a little skeptical when i walk into a restaurant on a friday or saturday night and it s almost empty that s never a good sign however mijana proved to be a great new place for tasty ethnic food that has lots of vegetarian options my husband ordered a spiced lentil dish and i got the vegetarian moussaka both came with some rice and a side salad i really enjoyed my meal and even ate the leftovers for breakfast the next morning service was friendly but since i only saw one server and maybe one trainee it got a little sparse once a large birthday group was seated next to our table i had a hard time getting water refills and had to wait quite a while for the missing tzatziki that should have come with my dinner belly dancing entertainment livened up the place and apparently there was going to be salsa lessons later that night decent prices for the portion sizes oh and the bread and dipping sauce they brought at the beginning of the meal was amazing
  very good take out chinese food reasonably priced and we got tons of food we were very happy with our order i belive we had the take out special for 4 and it was around 45 delivered delivery was very quick
  was in town for a convention and a college suggested we drop in for lunch staff was very attentive and the restaurant is impeccable the choices of meats are a carnivores delight the food would have been a bit more enjoyable if they mind how much salt is added to the meat i am a regular guy who doesn t mind salt but man they really over did it other that being heavy handed on the salt i would probably go back next time i am in town
  i go to esquire a fair amount but mostly for the pineapple tequila margaritas they re to die for and often the only thing i order here otherwise the spirits and beer selections are okay it s about on par with the rest of the downtown bars similar to jupiters for instance the pool space is nice and open as well i m not a huge fan of the aesthetic my inner ocd hates the peanut shell on the floor schtick but it s a pretty good bar the food on the other hand has been consistently underwhelming i haven t tried the pizza yet but that s because i ve been unimpressed by the other stuff i have tried the appetizers tend to be greasy and the chicken fingers were weak plus food normally takes forever to come out of the oven in short come for the booze but eat beforehand
  lunch here was tasty the bangers mash were a little different than others i ve had with a mustard y sort of sauce and the portion was quite generous i also had a super tasty strawberry ale the first beer i have ever truly enjoyed they have a very big selection to choose from so i guess i was bound to find something i liked
  great food and staff but do not come here in a party of 2 and expect the order and be out the door in less 45 minutes
  best thai food i ve ever had i have had thai food in many places in chandler gilbert and scottsdale this is by far the best most authentic thai food that i have ever had it will delight your taste buds and make you feel happy and satisfied this food is made with love creativity and lots of flavor menu is reasonably priced and they offer the usual mild medium and hot farther up on the spicy hot scale they offer thai medium and thai hot not many thai places offer this so if you happened to like super spicy hot dishes this is your place friendly and fast service enjoy dishes i have had are phad thai green curry red curry punang curry tom yum soup drunken noodles every dish i have had is unique and delicious tons of flavor your taste buds will go wild they also have a menu online in pdf format so you can check out the pricing description and images here is the mr thai bistro in gilbert menu link http www mrthaibistro com mrthai_online_menu pdf
  dear uppercrust management the last two times i ve been in for pizza the service was lacking despite the dining area being quite slow waiting more than 15 minutes for a beer that i ordered was disappointing the lounge always seems like it s doing a good business and your attention is focused there instead being spread throughout the restaurant it seems to get good service i ll have to leave the kids at home since they re not allowed in the bar area
  i m a jersey girl and i love pizza but not this pizza it was awful and very doughy it tasted like a frozen pizza from the supermarket the lady behind the counter was nice enough but i should ve known something was up when we were the only ones in there on a saturday night for pick up sorry we will not be coming back the search for good ny style pizza in the desert continues
  wowzers i was so excited to try out the new spot in town as i had heard good things and they did not disappoint the man and i stopped in for lunch on a monday as a precursor to our mid afternoon massages i gotta give them 5 stars on the food the lunch menu is a fantastic deal you get an appetizer and an entree lunch portion and a soft drink for 15 this is really really reasonable considering the quality and deliciousness of what you get i had the tortilla soup to start which had incredible depth of flavor it beat the pants off the ceviche that the bf ordered then i had the queso fundito for my entree this is where i thought i had gone to heaven this dish is a duck barbacoa yep duck and its amazing it is served in a cast iron skillet with a red chile like sauce roasted poblano peppers and is covered in 3 cheeses that are browned and bubbly on top you put this delectable mix into fresh tortillas and chow down there was even enough for me to take to work for lunch the next day i give them 3 1 2 stars on drinks the margs are good but not the best and they are definitely priced on the high end the jefe was the best one i tasted but just not sure its an 11 drink if you add fresh fruit blood orange it adds a couple more bucks to the price too i would probably abstain from their drinks in the future unless they had a happy hour discount or i just felt like spending club prices on drinks the service could use some tweaking 3 stars it wasn t awful but it wasn t great we found ourselves waiting a solid 8 10 minutes after placing a drink order before the server came back for our food order there were only about 4 other tables in the whole place so i m not sure what he was up to that whole time he did make solid recommendations on the food and had an understanding on the menu but his attentiveness could be better smiling would also be good a manager stopped by at one point and she was super nice asking about our lunch and gave a good recommendation on a drink i will definitely recommend this place and keep it in my list of places to visit again
  here s the place where i first fell in love with uni they limit 2 plates of uni per person i think but the quality of their seafood is really fresh they have all you can eat sushi but the awesome part is it is not buffet style they make it upon order so the rolls always come out hot and fresh the tempura is actually still crispy when they serve it it s quite a drive from the strip and at night i don t even know if you can get a cab to go down there to pick you up and bring you back to the strip
  nice place with good food it has a different feel to it they have a big table in the center of the room lounge style that you can bring a party of about 8 12 people and still be able to sit all together
  uptown vig it s been serving up some uptown food i bet it s never served a scottsdale guy i bet the chef really never thought why i m gonna try the uptown vig it s been hiding in the phoenix valley as long as they serve up a cup of joe and now it s looking for a scottsdale man that s what i am lyrics billy joel uptown girl the uptown vig has been in the valley for over 5 years serving up some delitable dishes great for the hangover not the movie but seriously get you butt up and hit up the uptown vig you might find yourself and uptown girl like billy the vig as we call it ah har har is a modern hip place where live music and game playing are mixed together it s patio area is a great place to catch some sun glare while sipping your mimosa and or wine hell hit me up with another shot the uptown vig as i ve stated serves up a mean hangover brunch menu they literally have a dish called the hangover helper does it work i ll let you be the judge but i tell you what as a runner it s great way to carbo load i recently had the monte cristo which i m not too sure why it s called that but wowza french toast sandwich with ham and over easy egg whaa sha yeah if i had a hangover i ve forget about it already top it off with some fresh strawberry preserves and whip cream and you re golden boy outsider reference enjoy
  this place was awesomesauce we ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer and loved it it came out on a large block of wood and we ended up taking two pieces home otherwise we would not have had room for our meal it was delicious and the bread is homemade i ordered the tacos and was blown away by the walnut filling i will have a hard time exploring the menu when all i will be able to think about are those tacos my husband got the burrito and almost didn t want to give me a bite i think the only reason he did was to get a bite of mine haha their iced tea is also amazing and they give refills we will definitely be going here again not just to support local organic vegan food in the otherwise widely vegan barren arizona but because their food was just that good
  fast friendly service with delicious food every time this place is clean and they get your food to you fast and with a smile om their face love it and definitely recommend
  inconsistent pizza quality and too cool staff to acknowledge poor service such as saying pickup pie will be ready in 20 minutes and it takes more than 40 bad combination
  best neighborhood pizza joint around we love the friendly staff and owners the food is really good portions are large and prices right
  stopped by last sunday to catch some football while shopping at town square they have happy hour at specific times mondays saturdays but on sundays it s all day at the bar score happy hour specials include drinks priced at 4 8 and appetizers priced 2 6 which can t be beat we ordered some drinks as well as a few appetizers from the happy hour menu my favorite were the wings which were sauced perfectly and my least favorite were the chips and salsa which was super watered down and had little taste to it the chips were also super salty you have to try their beer while you re here i had the hef and it was so refreshing especially after a morning of shopping service was a little lacking but we were sitting at the bar which isn t exactly place where you should expect to get fast decent service at any restaurant here they only had 1 bartender overseeing the entire bar area on a football sunday we never got silverware or napkins and i ended up having to grab some that were set on a nearby table and also used our drink bar napkins c mon we had wings can we at least get 1 or 2 napkins
  the cuban sandwich wow what a find can t wait to come back the staff is so friendly and kind i wish we had this place in seattle
  dilallo is a great burger joint for your quick fix unlike belpro s you can expect a tasty burger that isn t too greasy the service is quick simple just like the food though it didn t blow me away the food was a good value and portion i left satisfied additionally i can t ignore the staff being very friendly hospitable bottom line i won t go out of my way to get myself or others to a dilallo but i mark it down as a safe bet if ever the option comes up again
  so fantastic one of our best stops in vegas great staff awesome service each plate was better than the next we even ordered items twice the risotto was amazing and i still think about it yes i know that sounds weird but its true thank you for an incredible experience
  not in love yet but given it s proximity to my house i m gonna try real hard
  after having already tried viva mexico once we thought we would be adventurous and try pancho villas but we came away disappointed this place has a great location and as such is usually busy however that is because it is touristy and looks inviting but the food betrays it and is quite basic and not authentic mexican at all to top it off the staff is unfriendly and even at times disdaining
  as a new resident from la this is a cafe that features a hip understated atmosphere with great service food and drink one of my new cafes choices in the az
  has this place taken on new management i went recently and it was not even close to what it was a year or so ago i was just a little disappointed i had the gyro and it was bland and had no crisp to it i used to love this place i m hoping it was just a 1 time thing
  the prices are good but the service is very lacking
  solid diner food i decided to check it out after seeing the place on diners drive ins and dives on the food network there was a 10 15 minute wait for sunday lunch go a little earlier to beat the church crowd and you probably won t have to wait i had the turkey gravy and dressing got a piece of the carrot cake to go everything was excellent everything i saw on other tables looked great too i ll definitely be returning
  um the view cool spot loud busy pricey drinks but the place was all about the patio behind the fountain for me we hung out a bit and skidattled check it out
  eat lunch here every day can not beat the lunch specials i always eat in the isolated back bar so i can be served by the best bartender in town clay he s basically my hero tim is the homie too great specials and great corporate staff that makes my visit consistent every time
  i went to the family and friends opening when i first walked in the ambiance it s very open and refreshing the dark meat tenders is delicious i recommend it the seasoning on the chicken is good too i honestly didn t need the sauces but if i was to pick one the habanero hot sauce is it
  i m giving this place two stars because the prices of the meals were way to over priced especially for okay food i got huevos rancheros and never again hahaah i will say that the server was very nice though i got the melon margarita which was delicious and he let me try the banana margarita too soooo i might go back to try the different flavored margaritas which are pricy too but that s about it
  love this place love the food love the atmoshpere it seems like the menu is always changing here butternut squah croquettes are awesome the black bean veggie burger is swell
  this little inconspicuous restaurant just blew my mind this is by a massive margin the best breakfast experience i ve had the food was exceptional and the service was unparalleled i d like to talk about the owner for a minute as well there is a distinct difference between a boss and a leader this man exemplifies the very definition of a servant leader he runs his business from the tip of the spear and drags the cart of business as it were from the front just like his employees i am still reeling from the experience i had here 11 10
  i m giving 2 starts because i feel bad basically mine the worst thai food of my life the papaya salad was waaaay too salty with an over load of fish sauce and not balanced flavor wise i tried adding sugar but it was still too salty the thai egg rolls were mushy on the outside which was also disappointing my pad see eww was also too salty and i again tried to add sugar but it still didn t help balance the flavor i ended up throwing everything away and just making my own masaman at home so bummed and disappointed since i really wanted to support a small business
  ok went there last night we don t have a lot of choices way out here in the west valley the service and food were great tables were clean curry chicken and shrimp fried rice were both excellent i ll be coming back again if you want to try some good chinese food this is the place take out also
  in vegas wherever you can find cheap and large portion places is filled with people we arrived this breakfast place on a saturday noon around 11am and the wait line is about 1 hour and 15 min long for two people well i guess people here have nothing else to do so the wait is tolerable since there is no where else you can find easy meal we decided to wait the restaurant is actually pretty big a lot of people serve is fast though the food took about 20 25 min to arrive so that part was not too bad but the food itself was not that great we had a mojito which was pretty strong and tasty the food indeed came in huge portion but the taste wasn t that great we tried the french toast which was lack much flavor except for the sweetness from the syrup and my omelette with mushroom was very plain as well not taste of the egg and the potato on the side was not crispy and not so great the only highlight was their homemade strawberry jam and whipped butter those help the plain food to be more tasty this is vegas line up for the not so great food only for the big portion and cheap price
  the major thing that this crazy mocha has going for it is the atmosphere interior design and how comfortable it is to spend time here it s bright with lots of windows and sunlight on sunny days of course and plenty of seating in a central location they offer some unique options such as small sandwiches and pasta salads each week catered by sausalito on liberty avenue the coffee is just okay i ve had better at many different locations in and out of pittsburgh rip quiet storm but they do offer almond milk as a milk alternative which is a huge plus and their chai latte with almond milk is divine i like that they offer a lot of different healthy options to offset the standard sweets and pastries such as gluten free and vegan bars and snacks however i ve notice that their costs have gone up since they first opened when they first opened i could get a medium latte with soy milk and biscotti for under under 5 around 4 69 and now it s over 6 with almond milk but it s almost the same upcharge as soy so overall their prices have increased but i don t feel that their quality has increased with their prices i go here because it s convenient to where i work but if i had a choice i d go somewhere else on a regular basis
  i ve only dined in this restaurant once and i have never been back nor do i plan on going back my boyfriend had their pad thai and i ordered their pad kee mao aka drunken noodles the food was sooo sooo disappointing that i never wanted to return my boyfriends pad thai was all goey and had no texture except goo and extra goo i know the gooeyness means they overcooked his noodles lets not even talk about my pad kee mao it was probably hands down the worst i ve ever tasted in my life they should be ashamed of putting their name on it all it tasted like was wide rice noodles doused in siracha sauce it s shameful to even call it pad kee mao and should call it siracha noodles end of story
  the food is above average pub food the beer list is not extensive and improvements could be made here the service is great a lovely pub all around but it is in the basement dark dank tight and loud good pub all around
  by far the best bakery eatery i ve been too far better than any of the competition wholesome quality food so happy we found this place we come here almost everyday for breakfast or lunch sometimes both
  bad kebabs psychotic owner dirty chit chat the owner mr habib had us seated next to the only occupied table in an empty restaurant and served our meals himself the kebabs with rice weren t good at all and we didn t finish our dish however the restaurant looks nice and neat worst part while eating our meals the owner kept coming out talking to the two gentlemen sitting next to us in farsi and in a psychotic like behavior they sounded friends or knew each others to our surprise he was using very very bad words and dialog in farsi in his conversation with them that totally shocked us specially when you are at a dinner table you don t want to hear words shi and stuff like that in an iranian culture almost any culture this is too rude and absolutely unacceptable anyway he is a very rude man please note on the top of the very expensive bills there is a big charge under tax this should include the tip as well the tax is to fool us to add an additional for the tip have you paid attention to those names and locations giving this place 4 or 5 stars either they are not much familiar with persian foods or most of them live in las vegas
  great beer selection especially if you re into four peaks brews i had the pesto pizza and added garlic it was absolutely delicious the only thing that was bothersome was we were sitting at the pizza bar which happens to be next to where the food comes out of the kitchen and some guy that worked there kept complaining to the cooks pizza makers about the food it s like if you don t like it so much why don t you get behind the counter and make it yourself so besides the whiney man and semi attentive server the food is absolutely delicious and the atmosphere is great i would definitely recommend the parlor to anyone who likes awesome gourmet pizza
  auntie pasto s has taken the place of the horribly overpriced tutti santi on guadalupe we ve been driving by in the hopes that it was open and we finally got the chance to visit we were not disappointed we got there early around 4 30 so we could catch their happy hour 3 6pm we had the mozzarella sticks with house made marinara delicious the sauce was wonderful garlicky but that s how we like it my fiancee ordered spaghetti and meatballs and i ordered linguine and clams in a white wine garlic sauce the meatballs were dense and fresh there was no denying they were house made the linguine and clams was equally fantastic both meals came with unlimited salad and bread the salad was tossed tableside by our server and had a traditional italian style vinaigrette the bread was also house made and came with an italian herb seasoned olive oil to dip the dip was a tad salty but very tasty since the restaurant is new the service is a little green but it wasn t an issue for us i wish auntie pasto s the best of luck we ll definitely be back soon
  great beer selection reasonably priced i m giving 4 stars instead of 5 simply because i was only moderately amazed with my frank nitti chicago cracker thin pizza i have every intention of trying the detroit red top on my next visit i hear it s amaze balls but get there early because apparently it sells out on busy nights sit at the bar andrew is the man
  this was such 50 50 place out of three different specialty pizzas we ordered one was really good one was okay and the other was really bad salad was good but nothing special ranch dressing was really good bleu cheese dressing was really bad chicken tenders were burnt like to the point that when i opened the container it smelled like a kitchen was on fire they were so black i could not believe that they actually delivered those to us the buffalo sauce was good but useless since our chicken was not eatible the baked potato fries were a good concept and had a good flavor but the fries were soggy but maybe that was just because they were delivered okay maybe it was less than a 50 50 ratio here since we did spend over 100 for so much dissapointment
  food is mediocre service super slow the wait staff just stands around while patrons are staring at them trying to get their attention the only reason i keep coming cuz they have descent prices will i come back sure for take out only
  it was just ok clearly workers didn t want to be there at 9am on sunday very funky tons of toys for little kids which would be nice if i had em got et bagel with cream cheese not impressed
  love this place for a casual lunch the tacos and crab cake are my favorites make sure you try their beans they are to die for they have great local selections in beer and nice wines by the glass their happy hour pricing is the best in the area
  great food loved the variety in cuisines ranging from asian and italian to mediterranean even all the food was good and our server was awesome he was friendly constantly checked up on us and made sure our drinks were full the best part was the huge variety of sweets tons of carrot cake flan cheesecake pies ice cream it literally had every sweet imagineable this place is sweet tooth heaven would definitely come back here on our next vegas visit
  i was a little nervous with the name cafe sound small and limited the place was great good beer and good food
  best buffet ever we paid 59 for 5 people s launch including drink it was great selection and quality don t be fooled with high priced buffet around las vegas blvd and strip area this is the deal
  seriously i didn t review this place oops i ve been here twice now and must say there is some good food coming out of their kitchen the eggplant parmesan has some amazing sauce with it unlike any i ve had before a lot of red sauces all taste somewhat similar but this is something special both times i ve come home with leftovers so portions are on the larger size complimentary bread and oil starts your meal off service has always been spot on my only major gripe about the place is the seating and size of the place be warned this location is small both times i went i ended up with ass in my face when someone sat next to me was leaving
  i have been eating here for a while and never had any problems until today i ordered a turkey and bacon avocado sandwich and i got a turkey and avocado sandwich probably they didn t have any more bacon from breakfast and where to lazy to cook more so they just hoped i wouldn t notice i called back and they wouldn t come down the street to my work and fix there mistake they where rude and told me that if i didn t want to eat their anymore that was fine no money back either poor customer service i won t go their again
  best chinese food i ve ever had first place i take people when they visit from out of town only place i go to celebrate
  the olive garden has always been one of my favorite restaurants i ve been here a few times and was pleased with the friendliness of the waiters waitresses and the food is delicious
  drove all the way here from the other side of town and wow yuck old chicken i don t eat pork so that was not an option my kid liked the pork sandwich but my chicken sandwich was terrible don t think i ll be going back so disappointing
  their food carne asada tacos campechana fries was delicious it was freezing and both entrances were open and blowing wind our food was cold you could see that it was freezing yet no one offered to close one entrance the cashiers wore their jackets too try to go to this place when it is not freezing cold maybe during summer hours
  went here once for some cider a 1 taco and to watch a show pretty cool joint same idea as casa but there s wifi so you get the macbook crowd and also it s a bit pricier so it leans more towards yuppiedom rather than hipsterdom if that makes sense cool place i d go to cagibi if i wanted a quieter version of what s offered at casa basically
  very tasty my boyfriend and i got the daily special 2 slices and a drink for 5 95 you pick your toppings for 25 each my bf got bacon and it was very bacony i got mushrooms on one and italian sausage on the other the mushrooms were fresh but not quite cooked but the sausage was fantastic the garlic rolls were delicious and come with a side of marinara sauce it was awesome
  this one of best tasting food you can get in montreal but there is always a line up so beware also a word of advise don t go in big group the place is small don t forget to try the sake ice cream
  very similar to it s counterpart bar marco in quality of cocktails but with every aspect of the bar a little simpler the cocktail menu is pared down to classics and the food menu is really just snacks and nibbles the space is very similar to bar marco but the decor seems to lack the finish that bar marco has good place for a laid back drink on the week nights which is probably the biggest draw for me love that there are more options in the east end for craft cocktails there s also plenty of street parking service was also very attentive and friendly so no complaints here just remember that this isn t bar marco so the bartender isn t going to concoct a different cocktail each time they re more than happy to provide suggestions but they do have the menu of cocktails for a reason
  holy mackerel listen just go there and order the business salad or whatever it s called avocado massaged kale hemp seeds quinoa etc it s amazing heaven in a box is what they should have called it the cafe also has a great staff friendly attentive and quick don t forget the tip jar
  this was my second time eating here third time visiting considering that they turned us away one day when they had a private party not their fault but still irritating the first about 9 months ago was slightly better than this one but unfortunately this trip was so terrible i will not be back after living in peru for a while i wanted my husband to experience the food that i did we had an expiring deal coupon and immediately upon being seated we were asked about it the waitress was unpleasant from the beginning and the fact that we were using the deal they advertised seemed to be an inconvenience for her meanwhile we had to sit directly in the sun at a table instead of in a shaded booth because one of her children had sprawled out across the bench and has no desire to move her other toddler child had full run of the restaurant sucking on cups and walking up to all the guests in the restaurant completely unprofessional the anticuchos heart were the best thing we ordered but the portions were significantly smaller than our first visit the chicken and rice soup and chicken salad were fine not worth the non deal price tag they charge the cancha snack is good but i don t come to a restaurant for the corn nuts hubby ordered the lomo saltado w mixed meat the waitress knew she brought the wrong type with steak only but made no effort to correct the error at this point we were already fed up with the service and atmosphere oh we were seated under the ac duct which brought our food back down to fridge temps within minutes most disappointing was my pescado a la menier grilled fish with lemon garlic and white wine butter sauce usually 15 fish was tiny sauceless with a notable frozen flavor the vegetables were frozen peas and carrots and the white rice was just that white rice i could have made a tv dinner that tasted better than this and provided more value i was sooo disappointed as i d been looking forward to this all day reading the menu prior to going hoping to pick out something really good the inka kola we ordered never came but was still on the bill the waitress made us feel like intruders the entire time another couple asked if they could order a menu item above the max allowed for the meal and just pay the difference they were sternly told absolutely not no customer service to their credit i tried the ceviche on my first visit and it was good but after seeing how all of the food quality has gotten worse and the service prices are atrocious i can t even trust that is still the case and will not be returning
  i take my wife here because she loves it its one of her favorites i only gave it four stars because i think the service is becoming a little to fast food like for my taste
  we had a group on for vip and mimosas and breakfast buffet for two but there was no vip line just for the people who bought the group on group on people lined up one line and when we got there two cashier were ringing up the group on line wasn t ringing up the customers we got there about 10 35 and they stop serving breakfast at 11 00 and we just got in before 11 00 other who got in the line didn t get in and the manager told them they needed to pay the difference i felt glad i just got in right before 11 00 but the group only had one day before they expire so i felt bad but the food and service you can t not beat
  i just moved very close to fazio s so i was hoping it would be a place i could rely upon for a good meal it is very good italian hoagies loaded with fixings and good pizza i haven t tried the steak sandwiches yet but if the italian hoagies are any indication i bet i ll approve the pizza crust is thin and crispy and they used just the right amount of everything
  as far as vegas buffets are concerned this one is my favorite for brunch it s a tough call between this and bellagio but on easter sunday this champagne brunch won out i must give props to our waiter as he did a fabulous job of keeping our flutes full at most of these buffets the waiters check back very infrequently helpful hints have your drink order ready when you approach the counter to pay for your meal this is the only place that does it this way so just be prepared for that question ask if you can be seated in one of the little alcoves the noise level is a lot lower and there aren t massive amounts of people weaving around your table staring at your food wait in line for the crepe they are delicious especially as a dessert stuffed with your favorite fruit if you don t see an item on the buffet that was listed on the menu let someone know and they will track it down for you this goes for the meat preparation as well don t skip the mashed potatoes they re delicious one star gets deducted for the crab legs having been spoiled by a few of the other buffets i was not a fan of having to crack my on crab legs but there were plenty of other items on the buffet that made up for this slight inconvenience
  the place is pretty cool i ve wanted to check this place out for 10 years there red chili sucks i wouldn t walk across the street if they let me it for free for life there green ain t bad but there chilis more like gravy i like there chimi special on monday the service is good there menus pretty big i ll come back it has a vibe i like and i m sure there s other stuff on the menu that s good seen a few thing i d like to try not to many mexican spots impress me nothing like my g maws cooking when it comes to chili
  wednesday 50 cent wing night walked in about 9 45 so host so we cruised over to the bar area about 3 watress walked by us without saying anything no hello s or have a seat or we ll be with you shortly nothing i felt awekward didn t want to just sit somewhere any get ignored referrence thread about couple getting arrested after wondering around we ended up at the bar took few minutes for bartender to come over too so by the time he came and took our order it was happy hour yay for slow service anyways beer selection was awesome drink deals were not i thought happy hour means cheap beer i guess not here if there were they didn t tell us i know it s a wing store and we should get wing but nothing on their menu sounds good other than wings why do you even have other food items wings it is so my friend didn t know how big the wings were it was more like a drum stick he ordered a dozen 2 of 6 flavors they were pretty good the evening went pretty well just like any other sports bar but way too bright inside bright light drinking headache so almost closing time a guy next to us offered to buy us drinks not just a drink but irish car bomb omg worst hangover ever i had to leave my car there and call a cab when a patron says no i don t need more drink the good bartender shouldn t serve more drink even though obnoxious guy offer to buy them let s think safety before upselling wings were good but i won t go back
  very nice place waited for ten minutes on labor day weekend for brunch bread is hard but butter is soft and delicious we had the corque madame and french toast oatmeal yogurt fit dessert all tasty fries are good when hot though thumbs for the jam bottom up even with nothing service was very tentative recommend visit
  really upset the first time we went we gave 5 stars but after today i will never ever go to this place again we first were seated then 3 other couples were seated approx 5 mins after us they all got they re drinks before us i brushed it off even tho one couple was seated right next to me in a booth then i asked a random waitress that we were ready to order she said she ll get our server our server ended up at the table next to us and still after 10 mins hadn t even said hello to us so now i m getting heated so finally she took our order fish plate catfish sandwich waffle w eggs fried chicken basket we waited and waited for our food the couple next to us finished they re food and we still hadn t received ours at that point my husband went to the register to ask what s up they said they would look into it by that time the 2 other couples got there food our waitress finally came up and explained to us that fish takes longer whatever she then walks away and the guy that just got his food said loudly that his catfish is great wow so then we get our food but my husbands food never arrives ugh they never made it then the cooks and the waitress start fighting where we all can here them in a busy loud restaurant so finally w no apology he gets his sandwich about 10 mins later so the worst part happens i m done w my drink and i start to eat the ice and omg there s a huge fly in the ice my kids and i were all drinking from it so i called my waitress and her tone was so bad as if i freakin put the damn fly in my drink i got my kids handed her the drink and left sick to my stomach crying they didn t even apologize for nothing and still made us pay everything should of been free they only took off drinks and my meal ugh never again
  it s been hit or miss the pepidew stuffed peppers are my fave and i want a double order every time i go otherwise i ve had good and just mediocre food here the atmosphere is cool such a small environment the wait staff is typically very knowledgeable friendly and very attentive sometimes i wish they would open up the patio great wine selection too
  love the nite time atmosphere around the campfire good food great friends and a stress free nite by the campfire
  best fish sandwich in charlotte they are nickel and dimey but the food is inexpensive so it s not a big deal i love the potato salad reminds me of family cookouts the slaw isn t anything super special but it is fresh i ve actually never had the chicken i m going to assume it s amazing just based on how good the fish is
  got food to go all good sammi a good bartender and attentive unfortunately 2 typical douche bag scottsdale brosevelts showed up talking way too loud about poker gaming swearing and actually played a negro rap song from their phone at ba r totally uncool and since sammi knew these 2 clowns should ve advised them to pipe down i won t knock the restaurant or sammi as they cant control who comes in but these 2 fools ran me outta there back to the pound dog out
  top notch mexican food in las vegas it s well worth your time to go downtown and look this place up great food at a great price the guacamole is a must the service is great too my opinion it s the best of las vegas
  we decided to go out to eat after our air conditioner failed to kill time waiting for the tech we wanted to try a new place we d driven by a few times and honestly didn t know this place existed so this one is all yelp we arrived to find the place quiet it is tastefully decorated for the most part with a nice bookshelf and stylish touches though they apparently didn t prime before painting atmosphere ok we ordered off of their mercifully compact menu it s straightforward and that is a 180 from most places that serve this kind of food my wife ordered the moo shu pork and i had the general s spicy chicken she said that the pork was among the best she s had and i found the chicken to be flavorful with a spicy note that comes in late both dishes were simple but well prepared properly seasoned and very tasty the food was hot temperature wise but not so hot that it could not be eaten immediately which is also refreshing it seems to be a place with a simple recipe quality food quick and simple with none of the sometimes bizarre ethnic trappings service was very friendly and communicative will go here again for sit down chinese food i want to try something off their hibachi
  we eat here every time we come to vegas this is a must the food is delicious and the atmosphere is trendy we recommend this place to all our friends and will continue to eat here a must go
  came at prime time on friday night was a bit of a wait but not excessive the king crab appetizer was enough to serve as an entree it came with microgreens and summer squash and was worth the 19 price tag we also had a side of steamed tricolor cauliflower with ponzu sauce worth the 3 bucks but so much more could have been done with this the roasted corn and poblano soup was outstanding try the fruit pie and gelato for dessert i will probably try short ribs next time i come jody our server was top notch howie burger with the gruyere cheese and caramelized onions was good combination per friend s report aside from the burger all the items we ordered were from the small featured menu which generally features local seasonal ingredients it s noisy inside so pick somewhere else if you want an intimate romantic dinner there is a back patio if outside dining is a realistic option
  since lawrence was closed for holiday we found voro by chance for brunch we sat at the bar and had excellent service from the bartender my vegetarian frittata was delicious and packed with lots of veggies i ordered a side of chorizo and it was good not the ground type that i expected like i find in ny mexican restaurants no drip coffee here their cappuccino was good and espresso better free wifi their bloody mary with clam juice was delicious i forget the name of it check it out
  first time here i had the the john wayne omelet ham sausage bacon and cheese served with potatoes and toast i also had coffee with non dairy flavored creamer my alex had the cheese omelet cheese blend provolone havarti feta swiss or mozzarella served with potatoes and toast he had ice tea really good food here service as great and the restaurant was immaculate we were here on a sunday only open till 3 00 pm we d like to come back and try lunch some time
  good pricing on thier lunch special 12 95 for two meats soup or salad and an appetizer since its a korean place you get free side dishes cucumbers fish cakes bean sprouts kimchi and squid marinated great customer service david went above and beyond to make sure we had enough food and know how to cook the meats the kobe was super tender and the bulgogi was flavorful
  the restaurant hosted a large group gracefully the staff made every effort to keep our glasses full and our food coming quick
  food was great nick the manager is very good at keeping his patrons happy we will certainly be back
  the menu they handed me when i walked in felt like it hadn t been cleaned since the place opened had a horrid odor and i just walked out if they can t clean their menus how can i expect them to clean the kitchen where they make my food
  i ordered a egg salad sandwich from here and i would not recommend it it only had egg and mayo and the egg was so smashed sorry but i have had a really good egg sandwich and this one was pretty bad
  hands down best raw food in las vegas you really can t go wrong i m not even a raw foodist but i can t argue deliciousness if you re like me and you re new to eating raw or if raw food isn t exactly your scene there s plenty for you to enjoy without having to try anything new their extensive list of 28 smoothies doesn t disappoint these hearty meals in a cup can be a great breakfast on the go at go raw they don t filler your drinks with ice and syrup it s all 100 pure organic ingredients and it s good too don t be scared you don t have to be a hippie or adopt an eastern philosophy to find something here you like in short give it a try
  i love the swanky ocean s 11 13 feel of this place if only i had been noshing with danny ocean instead of on a business trip each of us had the chopped salad yowza and split a couple of small plates including the truffled grilled cheese the tomato and goat cheese casserole double yowza i had to grab several match books on the way home so just in case any of my friends are at my house when i light a candle they will know just how swanky i roll lol
  the wait is worth it on sunday mornings the food is great prices are awesome family atmosphere kid friendly i have to say since we have been living here people haven t been so friendly but we were given a dose of hope on our sunday morning breakfast outing we my husband our little girl and myself went november 1st 2015 at 10 am in the morning needing a very bad pick me up after my grandmother getting a really bad diagnosis which just was the tip of the iceberg of our bad week needless to say we really needed a dose of hope in humanity and it seems someone answered the call and picked up our tab it was amazing what they did for our family it might have been a simple meal to anyone else but for us it was hope thanks a million times over for whom ever did this for us bless you a million times over
  wow who was the genius that put a pizza place right next to marquee that guy should be rewarded like a boss because having the pizza literally 30 seconds away is about as clutch as you can possibly get again this is why the cosmo rules yeah it s expensive but what in vegas isn t expensive usually 5 a slice and that s before you get into multiple topping slices honestly though at least the pizza is pretty damn good for 5 crust is has good complexion the cheese is delicious and the toppings are always quality they always make sure to stick it in the oven before they give it over to you so it is piping hot when you get it ain t no other way to eat pizza than piping hot my only wish is that they had chicken pesto pizza but it s ok i ll let you slide because your italian sausage pepperoni and meatball pizzas are bomb as hell staff is great very understanding and accommodating considering all the drunk hungry people that pass by here between 2 to 5 am and not just that but this place gets pretty entertaining because drunk ppl lol last time i went and waited in line some girl was going off about how she wanted to beat the crap out of another girl but didn t out of respect for the bachelorette party new night new stories ah good times
  fkkk i know you a new store but seriously u charged me twice and than got mad because i wanted a refund for a drink that was mine please speak nicely still in love w maryland pwy trop the make u feel human there
  they delivered to us recently and i wasn t ecstatic over the shrimp fantasy i had the sushi was decent most of everything else was bland and average i don t know if eating at the restaurant would have made a difference or not the delivery did come on time though nothing special in my book
  kinda pricey but good quality i personally didn t like the bread too heavy but my husband loves it with the marinara i asked for a side salad and got charged 11 what my entree was 15 how is that a side salad the wedge salad was good though drowned in dressing but good dressing lacking in toppings though didn t see any egg or much bacon
  delicious french breakfast large portions tasty meals and amazing coffee all with a view of the las vegas strip and eiffel tower i loved my turkey egg white avacado omelette my friend had the croque mouser all so delicious also very reasonably priced and efficient service
  if there was a way i could put zero stars i would i had the worst experience at this subway we had a group of about 5 people we were on our way to an event when we first walked in a lady walked out and said she was going on break and that a lady would be right out to serve us we stood and waited about 2 3 mins till i had to say hello this employee named terry walked out and in the beginning was very rude you can tell she did not want to make our sandwhiches this terry lady was rude about changing meats in the sandwhiches when i been to subway plenty of subways and others did it she also messed up one of our sandwhiches we requested ranch on it and she squirted it down with mayo we told her it was mayo and she ignored us we had to tell her about 3 4 times till she finally looked up and reliezed i will never step foot into this subway ever again and if you do dont let terry serve you totally killed my subway vibe
  ok i just do not get this place at all packed with traveling insurance brokers horny 30 somethings and desperate housewife wanna be s the scene is kinda terrifying the bar was ok except we had these meat head types breathing down our necks behind us because they couldn t sit at the bar and were obviously bent out of shape about it when the hostess finally came to get us she told me i wouldn t be seated in the dining room unless i removed my hat is that a promise or a threat when we were finally seated the waiter was snooty snooty why you work in a glorified tgi friday the food could have been outstanding it wasn t and it really wouldn t have mattered there s so many better places to eat in this town
  worst japanese restaurant ever chicken teriyaki came out raw gross and then the manager comes out and says all chicken should be pink or red because we use young chickens attitude very poor i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone food was awful we will not be back
  this is one of our family favorites great atmosphere and staff i took my staff there for a meeting and now they are all regulars the shepherds pie is delicious and they also have cottage pie if you don t like lamb ask for extra chutney with the scottish eggs don t miss out on the daily specials or the bread pudding
  tried this place again last night food is still fantastic service is still really bad tons of personal conversations among workers and worker tried to take my order when there were still several people in front of her i m not going to shout my order at you wait until i get there cashier was irritated that i didn t know what kind of sauce husband had on his food really if that info is important to have perhaps someone should be punching in an order at the front of the line i told several staff that our food was to go a worker put a lid on one item and walked off cashier was holding the bag and kept staring at me so after waaay too long i said that s ok i got this and took a lid from the stack and put it on the container myself like i said the food is fantastic but the experience and service are anything but
  the food was good the portion sizes were pretty large but the overall vibe is really what makes me want to go back
  so far the best breakfast place in pittsburgh try their egg benedict
  came here only for the bar don t order a dirty martini unless you know what you re getting into it was straight up gin and a bad idea noobs pear martini was really delicious but didn t make up for the rest tokyo tea wasn t very stiff and appletini was easy on the tini i had to say it thank you dr john dorian bartender waitress was hurrying us out at 11pm on a saturday night wtf she took away our candle yes i put that in the yelp review
  went there for a quick bite before the theater had the buffalo sloppy joes and they were disgusting dry buns thin sliced pickle then had the duck spring rolls also bad then in an effort to eat something we could tolerate ordered the lettuce cups with shrimp and they were just adquate very disappointing
  this place is just okay it s quite a bit of money for fairly underwhelming food the staff seem a bit aloof as well if you re looking for authentic japanese venture off the strip to raku but make reservations though
  it s good but not something to go crazy over i could live with without it some people say it s better than in n out but i personally don t think so
  great gulf oysters great food good service seriously great oysters one more time amazing oysters
  great service great atmosphere alot of space for everyone everything i ordered was plated beautifuly and tasted amazing can t wait to eat there again
  two stars because they were open when i needed something to eat and didn t get food poisoning afterwards bottom line it s an undermanned greasy diner there should only be two reason why you d eat here 1 need to use the complimentary food voucher from luxor or 2 you re a bad gambler and now your kids are hungry good job mom dad maybe next time you d keep the food budget in a separate sock so you won t put it all in on j10 off suit you idiot ps there is a 3rd reason to eat there if all your friends are watching criss angel and you re too broke to afford the tix with no battery left on your phone with no hotel room key that way you can keep an eye on the crowd as they exit the show to make sure you don t lose your wolf pack makes me wonder what kind of a untrustworthy friend you are to not have a room key
  my husband and i stopped in for lunch one day we were surprised at the large selection everything we had was delicious the service was excellent they kept the table cleared and drinks filled we will definitely go back
  this is a solid four stars you can sit at a bar with a great view of the movie or you can sit at a table either way you can t go wrong i ve never had a bad meal here in approx ten visits i recommend the lasagna new york strip wine or a cocktail and of course popcorn if you haven t been and you like movies you gotta add farrelli s to your rotation a great place for a date and if the clock is running on the babysitter this place is a must
  i rarely review because most places fall in between 2 4 stars so in not adding much influence this was a five star afternoon for me and my mum the beer selection was excellent but not so large that there might be a stale keg they also have ninkasi big ups for that started with the meat and cheese board which was so good a great quality items the wings were crispy and gold the sauce was on the side which is good for how slow i eat and how i like to sip my beer i was already full but we decided to split the sliders these are not regular sliders they were not the best i ve ever had but near the beef was cooked perfectly and the balance of the cheese and the texture mild sweetness of the onions made two more ninkasi beers disappear the service was perfect claire i think not too buggy but we were not left without a beer or water etc this is a great spot i could def party with friends here in the evening or do lunch as i did i will definitely return when back from sd
  the bartenders didn t know how to make almost half of the drinks we ordered i had heard there were dancers before i went but i guess all of that is gone now skip it
  absolutely delicious very well priced i will return often i love the alcohol free environment thank you for a great dinner
  favorite place to go great service fresh food and oh so yummy the fajita specials are great soup chips and dips and the fried onions are bomb
  as a nyc girl i have to say this is the first time i ever ordered from here and had delivery from the surprise az chain and this will be the last time i ever order i ordered baked ziti and it was so dry and looked like they baked a whole pan of it and then take from the pan and microwave it to heat it the ziti noodles were hard i ordered chicken wings as well i did not get any blue cheese dressing celery as i asked for and there garlic bread was definetely nuked it is as hard as a hardball you can not even chew it what a waste of money people who say this place is excellent must not be from ny sorry to write such a bad review but it is the truth
  i ve never had anything i didn t like from julian serrano the paella gambas croquetas beef and cheese stuffed peppers stuffed dates churros with spicy chocolate dip and the chocolate cake with mango gelato great location great service and great atmosphere i keep coming back for more
  had dinner here on a monday evening walked up at 7pm and it was a 2 hour wait for the restaurant section and was advised to try the bar casual area where we were sat immediately same menu same food no wait happy to see that you can get a sandwich or salad not just steak or crab and they had steaks starting at 25 which on the strip is pretty hard to do at a nice restaurant so this was a happy surprise started with bread good bread too then we tarted with stone crab as an appetizer i was surprised at how sweet these were they serve it with a cream dipping sauce which is totally not needed as the crab is good on its own i had bacon wrapped scallops for dinner something about bacon and scallops a great combo the scallops were tender and grilled nicely the husband had the special stripe bass which was moist and flavorful and topped with yummy mushrooms our friends each had a steak cooked perfectly to their order they looked really good and they both said they were really good for sides we got the mac n cheese potatoes lyonnaisse mashed potatoes broccolini the mac n cheese was more creamy than cheesy i like the potatoes lyonnaisse better than the mashed the lyon one came with carmelized onions on top of cubed hash brown like potatoes broccolini was nice and crunchy which is how i like my veggies so this was perfect for me service was good our water glasses were refilled regularly sitting in the bar area was nice since you got to people watch or watch a game on one of their tvs for 4 people plus a bottle of wine our total before tip was 295 in vegas on the strip for a nice steak seafood dinner to me that is reasonable i may be jaded but i like to eat out and try different places so i m glad we went here note this is not imo the best steak place but this is a really solid steak seafood restaurant would be a really good place for business lunch or people wanting a nice dinner but may be a bit price sensitive
  went for dinner with a group of 8 as a way to finish our vegas trip with a nice relaxing dinner i wouldn t say the food was anything spectacular but it was certainly good appetizers mussels a little bit too acidic for my liking but i did like the sourdough bread in the bowl eggplant parm decent we only got this one to please the vegetarians in our group prosciutto excellent calamari perfectly friend and not soggy at all the garlicy marinara was also very good entrees i ordered the mushroom and chicken ravioli it was very tasty a little salty for some of the others at the table other entrees ordered included the veal parm pretty good but didn t come with any pasta short rib risotto so salty it was inedible and had to be sent back and 1 or 2 of their flat bread pizzas definitely pass on these overall the food wasn t bad the atmosphere was great and the service sucked
  on mill ave this place is my favorite the staff is super nice and the drinks are really cheap i like that they mix up the music with electro overall this place is never as packed but that part f the reason why i enjoy the venue
  simpy said this place is overpriced and the food is just average i ordered the sukiyaki and there was plenty of broth in the pot but it was very bland sigh and what is sukiyaki without the raw egg bleh never coming to this place again
  we almost always do takeout from dragon bowl or delivery the food is always on the money much like good old ny chinese food they are much better than the average az chinese food place a regular item is the house lo mein always good house fried rice is yummy too the wife and kids like the sesame chicken and crab puffs i have also ordered the mu shu pork mongolian beef shrimp and scallops with brown sauce all very tasty the one thing that really sets them apart from other places is the people the owner is always there and she is so nice her kids help out and they are very cool too lightening fast delivery can t beat that don t pass up dragon bowl
  this place is alright if you are looking for the fast food alt the quality is hit or miss i usually route for a place like this big time but like i said its not consistent at all two of the three people that work there are rude and very unfriendly and need to smile if they work on those two problems and stay open a little later this place would be all aces
  stopped in here looking to try the shack stack one night this burger was different than anything i have had before if you love mushrooms and cheese on your burger than this is for you
  ok so whoever the manager or owner is some man i had the opportunity to place my order with he was wearing a dress shirt pants def not your usual fast food garb well he s hot if you care if not proceed below this was my first time at culvers i generally try to steer away from greasy fast food but sometimes there s nothing better than the hot crunch of saturated fat and meat so i decided to give culvers a try since i work close nearby i ordered the chicken sandwich w no pickles and added swiss cheese i also requested no salt on my fries so i could feel better about the 1500 calorie nutrition decision i was committed to the fries were perfect those cute little nuggets of crinkle were soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside everything you wished your mothers oven fries tasted like the fries great the burger heavenly nice and hot the chicken sung a sweet serenade to my mouth as every bite echoed traces of melodic deliciousness the bun was perfectly soft and had this buttery quality the kind that sticks to the roof of your mouth when u bite into it suffice it to say i was pleased wonderful service wonderful food glad i had a good experience
  this place is a fairly good deli but it is a little pricey for what you get i ordered the gluten free flatbread which is very small and the gluten free brownie and my meal was around 15 it is nice that they have gluten free options that s very rare at a deli i had fine service and very much enjoyed the pickles they bring out
  came for lunch the service and food were excellent wife had a salad i had the club and you could tell the ingredients were high quality and the food was well prepared
  what the heck is not to love about joe s the food the people the place they just do it really well seriously it s all good one of my favorites would be the bbq bacon blue burger yes it s really good ever had a grilled peanut butter and banana split sandwich yeah you should go ahead and try the one joe makes
  love this place what a great new addition to the south side of town us locals are really rolling out the red carpet to our new neighbor bachi burger with a large comfy couch nestled off to the side walls displaying pieces by local artists and jack johnson and dave matthews streaming out of the sound system it s just like being hanging out with friends at home but with delish eats that i would never be able to pull off there are burgers of all types that sound so good you are thinking about what you want to try on your next visit before you ve even ordered the pickle plate is a crispy tangy beauty with fun items like lemongrass and ginger the ronin burger was a garlic lover s dream and even had a perfectly cooked egg on top the crab cake burger was soft and perfectly seasoned try it with their yuzu aioli for added zest the garlic pepper sweet potato and parmesan truffle fries were all wonderful but the dipping sauces were all beyond compare after polishing every delicious bite you probably won t have any room for dessert so take a bag of their homemade toffee home to enjoy for the rest of the week the only complaint is that so many others already share my love of bachi burger and had beat me to the punch on this sunday evening leaving the restaurant sold out of edamame the grilled marinated cod burger and the cherry pop tart dessert no worries as they are all waiting patiently at the top of my to do list for next weekend s bachi burger outing
  i ordered a large cheese for pick up at 2 30pm on a saturday and was quoted 25 minutes but i m almost positive they had to have given me a pizza that was already done for by the slice it was extremely stiff wouldn t go back maybe i just got a bad pie
  i found this place thanks to yelp and i m glad i did the gentleman at the door was very kind and sat us promptly although they were busy our server ally did a great job and we were definitely happy with service the chicken fried steak is the best i ve had it has a non traditional gravy with bacon and maple syrup i heard bacon and maple syrup and i had to have it if you re in the area you have to stop i ll definitely be coming back
  awesome atmosphere dani is an amazing bartender and can keep a conversation while still paying attention to all the other patron s without skipping a beat and not leaving people feeling ignored a me and my wife really enjoyed coming here and will be back soon to try some food and more drinks all we had this trip was the pretzels with the guinness beer cheese tasted great all smiles
  very very good this place is the bomb i wish i take more people here recently i took my mother in law here and she loves the kushi age and the garlic gizzard yay sooo delicious
  this is a very differant place it has been here for about 20 years maybe more they have a good menu for food a bit high priced but very authentic so my girlfriend says and she grew up on british food their fish and chips are really good chicken pie and a good drink selection as well lots of parkiing in the lot big dining area and lots going on like pool darts and other games on different nights nice patio but smoking is allowed there good for smokers not good for me their is a strange smell inside that i can t quite place not bad just strange i like it though food is good
  well well well who knew how delicious thin pancakes could be wow i had the monterey as did the wife while the kids split the monkey the workers were amazingly and genuinely friendly the only negative is i live in phoenix so i won t visit often
  we stopped here before heading out to phoenix arizona on a wednesday afternoon when paying the cashier was having a problem using my debit card how much trouble i found out the next day the food was good but they charged my card twice to the tune of 30 31 not that its a tremendous amount of money but it has now been 6 weeks and they have yet to credit me back i merely warn people to pay cash or have your money held hostage
  i am in deep smit this place rawks it s not the ultimate dining experience i have ever had but the sushi is phenomenal first off the sushi chefs are actually japanese and not korean chinese or we ll just say north american and leave it at that secondly i asked my test question what is good for sashimi tonight and he immediately answered my favorite is the japanese red snapper which i ve never had i was slightly dubious as this was the daily special but it was good freakin good slap yo momma good as my la friend likes to say i was also slightly put off because the rolls weren t described anywhere i asked my waitress who was cutesy and attentive about this and she provided me with this alien looking quintopod with little cards describing a few five to be exact of the roll contents the red roll was the only thing that sounded good but boy was it delish i followed with tuna sashimi that was definitely some of the best tuna i ve had i also tried the new beer on the list echigo which starts kind of like a premium american amber like fat tire but finishes like traditional japanese lager it was lovely and has me hoping it will be available more places soon the place is definitely not perfect and i can see what the other reviewer said about small tables and multiple menus i was treated to 5 it s also probably not a great place to take a date unless they love sushi as much as i do in fact ditch your date and take me instead but to me food reigns supreme i ll sit on a bucket in a leaky tent to eat fabulous food and this was fabulous i ate there over 12 hours ago and i m still having food orgasm aftershocks the prices were reasonably high for a sushi place but you definitely get what you pay for i had the red snapper sashimi red roll tuna sashimi more red snapper sashimi d and unagi for dessert plus two beers and it came out to 75 before tip worth every penny
  awesome food had the spaghetti and meatball the best i ve ever had wife had the short rib ravioli and it was great too and we are very picky
  a weekday lunch staple love the signature salad caesar and the sandwiches i was surprised and delighted to see that they re open so late and on the weekends yey newks
  accidentally stopped here and ended up having the loveliest afternoon the food is delicious ambience pleasant staff most definitely attentive the owner phil might be the coolest guy in montreal we had espressos coffee cheese platter delicious champagne to top it off it was our 1 year anniversary and kindly phil obliged to play our wedding dance the very thought of you to say we spent a few lovely hours is putting it mildly this place and phil are gems thank you
  very friendly folks i used to feel that one had to get all dressed up to go there but being as how i live right behind the place i don t feel like getting all dressed up to get my morning fix so i go in in sweats and a tshirt and no one says anything lol great velvet awesome homemade whipped cream great experience oh and guys it s cheaper than starbucks and way way way better so give it a try
  we went here on a friend s recommendation but we were a bit disappointed i m always a bit leery about sushi places that offer an all you can eat option i went with the ayce option because the rolls were pretty expensive and i knew i d easily go over the 26 ayce tab the fish just didn t seem fresh it was a bit mushy the food presentation was just ok there was a nice selection of sushi and rolls on the ayce menu they seemed typical for what i ve seen in vegas vegas roll happy ending who s your daddy etc the best thing about kobe was the atmosphere it was a nice restaurant with good decor and a friendly staff i especially liked the sushi bar area complete with a samurai sword they have a few tvs 3 maybe playing sporting events so you can pig out while watching your games there s no time limit on the ayce
  great place fresh seafood nice to find wonderful with a big w seafood in las vegas we were in vegas and meeting some friends for lunch down the casino at fleur i figure i will stop for a pre lunch and a cocktail it was great the fresh crab legs and oysters they were cutting up the fish of the day so i wanted to see if they have hamachi belly that they can serve us wow nice it was so good that after lunch at fleur i took the firends back to rm for a short post lunch snacks yummy but not cheap
  i d heard about leroy fox and had been wanting to check it out believe me when i tell you leroy fox did not disappoint we of course had the fried chicken 1 4 north it was amazing the flavor was great even in the usually bland breast meat the brine they use gave it great taste the skin was crispy and was seasoned beautifully for a side i tried the zucchini fries they were recommended and well worth it the rest of the menu looked good but i can t wait to go back for more fried chicken outstanding
  been going to cane s since i lived in vegas this place always delivers a solid meal at a reasonable price it is like the perfect marriage of flavors in each bite with the slaw bread and fingers the chicken is even better back at the house heated to a crunchy level and dusted with your choice of spices of course you also always need to buy an extra cane s sauce so your not skimping on your dipping great sweet tea too
  i really like everything about this place food is good prices are fair the sunday and holiday buffets are very nice the staff if a bit unappreciative otherwise it would be a 5 star for me
  excellent service mediocre burger i swear god answered my prayers with the baja ranch dip ranch is my favorite food
  my roommates and i have ordered food from niyo several times the food is always really good and it can easily last for a couple of meals i typically order steak and chicken and it comes with lots of great vegetables specifically a serving of what i would describe as sweet brown sugar carrots that taste amazing they just opened up their full sushi bar menu which i m looking forward to trying highly recommend this place to anyone
  okay so i had the pleasure of tasting chuck s fare at a wine event last year and was floored add to this all the hype that gm has been getting from iron chef and the food network and i knew i absolutely had to go as you ve probably read on here before getting a reservation tends to be tricky i tried calling a month ahead and like everyone else i failed to get a call back but in gm s defense if you actually listen to the outgoing message they do say they only call back if there is availability and so i had to go to plan b plan b aka plan show no mercy and so i put on my saturday s best ditched my friends for two hours to go shopping and dropped by the restaurant with a pathetic look on my face yes i am sorry to say if you are serious about getting in here you re going to have to cut the dead weight aka your friends getting a seat at the bar is far easier for a group on one than it is for two or three well my plan worked the lovely gentleman at the front and i were able to come to an understanding which had me seated at the bar in 15 minutes and out the door in two hours which was two times longer than i needed the decor of the place is nice in a dark shabby chic kind of way which compliments it s location in old montreal the noise level was average not too loud not too soft and the music was a mish mash of 1980 s classics which was a nice departure from the constant dance party my ears are often assaulted with in montreal of course there is no signage outside but if you know how to read numbers and a map it shouldn t be a problem finding the place and the food om nom nom given that i was leading a secret double life and actually had dinner plans i opted to only try one item the cheddar tomato salad and it was like a beautiful spring day erupting in my mouth fried cheddar moist avocado cucumber red onion and juicy tomatoes on a bed of mixed greens dusted in herbs and ever so delicately dressed in a flavorful vinagrette it had me saying caprese what i also made friends with another wise solo diner see who needs old friends anyway who basically inhaled his lobster poutine and then proceeded to drool all over his dinner plate so i m going to go out on a limb and say it was pretty remarkable as well so in a nutshell if you are completely anal and value your friendships get someone who speaks quebecois french to call two months ahead every day until they take your reservation or ditch the friends wear something fashionable and flirt with the guy at the front door in my opinion the bar seats are best anyway because you can see right into the kitchen and the female bartender is not only easy on the eyes but super friendly and informative as well
  delicious pizza great service and good times i went to a holiday party here and the venue was wonderful plus on your birthdays they give you a very nice present can t beat that
  before coming here i had never had pho before but i definitely loved everything i consumed there to be honest i don t really know what i ate there because my friends always take the initiative to order for me however i ve eaten something different every time which leads me to believe that it d be hard to find anything bad on the menu also the girl that works there most often or at least the times i ve been there is super sweet and very helpful she answered all questions about the menu honestly and was a little spunky the good service only added to the positive experience i dig this place
  raspberry stuffed french toast a massive omlet with everything but the kitchen sink in it home cooked flavor from open faced sandwiches to bacon and eggs this is why you go to the dor stop as busy as this place gets there s always a seat ready when you go to walk in it s like magic this is an essential sunday breakfast spot in pittsburgh up there with pamela s more than affordable you will leave stuffed
  was searching for halal food and found this place when i first moved to vegas dined here a few times and the food has been excellent every time i had the gyro and the burger the burgers are okay but the gyros are incredible i ve tried the kabobs here as well and they are phenomenal only thing i didn t enjoy were the chicken strips they were dry and overcooked the ambience isn t all that great but who cares the food is awesome
  second time i have came here to watch the cubs game and they won t put it on love their food but if they can t accommodate a simple request i am not likely to ever return
  pub food definitely a loud atmosphere came here for dinner would be better for lunch mr pineapple is a good beer
  this place is one of the worst sushi joints in town why is everything covered in their stupid sauce which is just watered down siracha by the way the quality of fish is horrendous the tuna was old dull looking the salmon seemed rotten i got a little happy when i saw they had yellow tail only to be served a weird colored trash smelling piece of sashimi what a let down i hate being so negative but i really get mad with bad sushi and this place was bad
  i am so glad that i came across this place after my first experience it made me want to come back let me start with the food best burger in town hands down it s like an explosion of flavors once you take a bite it s so good you don t even want to eat your fries it s so good it doesn t need any other items to compliment the burger the blind pig burger was cooked just the way i wanted it and every bite i took just melted in my mouth the beef was so juicy the bacon was nice and thick the best part was it was not messy burger pick it up and go at it this burger has a distinct taste that i cant put my finger on it but you will remember the taste you may even dream about it lol the restaurant itself had a nice feel to it i came during lunch so it wasn t busy they have a full bar and a few tv s to watch sports etc the atmosphere feels positive and elegant it s a nice place to sit and enjoy lunch the price is a bit on the pricer side but after the service you receive and the food you eat it more that makes up for the cost sometimes i feel weary about spending so much for a burger but i ll tell you this at the end of the day price wasn t even on my mind all i kept thinking about was how tasteful the burger was and how nice the staff was i returned 1 week later and the same girl was working the counter she remembered me that made my day whenever someone acknowledges that they remember you it also shows to me that they pay attention and don t treat customers as just a number i had a great conversation with her when i arrived i will definitely make my way back here so i can try out their other items on the menu don t miss out go get yourself a bp burger now
  they have great taco tuesday here they are only a 1 the tacos aren t too big but what they lack in size they make up for in taste and variety and every single one is delicious
  our server ricky was great he knew his menu spot on this is my second time at echo rig and their customer service is consistent i had the jumping beef which was a great dish because it was light yet filling reasonable prices too
  i am a sushi snob from california and this is by far one of the best sushi restaurants i ve been to so fresh and so good
  loved the decor and was really excited about the menu tried the bread plate with marinated olives and garlic it was great also tried the asparagus panzanella salad was not impressed had a gnocchi dish as a main course was really disappointed in the texture and flavor
  what a wonderful experience from the food to the wine to the service everything was perfect i can t recommend sassi highly enough especially for special occasions the summer three course menu is a phenomenal value and the wine list contains some of the best wines i know
  wow wow wow if you are a vegetarian or vegan or neither and are anywhere near las vegas this place is a must the chef is the eccentric chef mayra who is passionate about food and flavors and her dishes are nothing short of amazing i am a vegetarian not vegan but while in vegas i brought non vegetarians non vegans with me to this place and they are the ones who kept suggesting we go back to pura vida how often has a vegetarian heard that request from non vegetarians it s an extensive menu with a ton of options ingredients are all fresh and every dish is so creative and flavorful portion sizes are great for table sharing and beautifully presented we tended to over order just to sample more dishes the servers were great in helping us pack food to go they are open till just past lunch their website has the hours closed thursdays the building and decor are basic but tell chef mayra that you found out about her restaurant from yelp and she will really go all out she loves people who are as passionate about food as she is you should have seen her excitement to come out of the kitchen and design a menu for us take her or the server s suggestions they will steer you in the right direction over the course of our visits we tried about 10 dishes and all were excellent it s a short drive from the strip and it s really not to be missed
  i ve eaten here several times over the last year this place has really great lunch specials and prices i ve had the pad thai pad siew and red curry chicken all were really good the service is really fast too the crab rangoon that came with lunch is good and the salad has a really tasty dressing i highly recommend this place
  americanized chinese food it is predictable and consistent but not enough flavor for me it is like an upscale panda express not bad but not excellent either if you want a safe bet then this place is for you
  everything here is delicious i ve never had a bad meal make sure to sit on the patio for a view of the fountains and great people watching some things we ve had seafood crepe scallops chicken brie sandwich steak sandwich salmon salad
  like others i m writing a post mortem tribute to one of my favorite restaurants in the world my husband and i first went to rosemary s on our honeymoon in 2001 we ve been there on every trip to lv since and we also went to the second restaurant they had at the rio for a while every visit was a delight michael and wendy as someone who recently closed a restaurant and is in the process of selling a second one my heart goes out to you know that you are missed and that i and many many others i m sure am monitoring the internet to see what you have in store for us next a fan from texas
  i had eaten at this same restaurant in san diego so when i came across one in vegas i got pretty excited unfortunately this location wasn t as good it might be because it s open 24 hours and it s in the worst city to live in but the service was pretty bad the pizza we ordered was also more greasy than what i had remembered and it took forever to get everything we ordered hummus as an appetizer and they gave us a huge serving of it with very little pita bread which was annoying the price and portions aren t bad and i liked that i was just the right amount of full after my meal vs the usual stuff your face buffets scattered throughout vegas
  nope nope just nope i wanted to like this place the menu looked good even though it is waaaaayyyy too big our server was pleasant enough and made wine suggestions and they put cucumber in the water which is awesome because i love cucumber in my water so this is where the two stars came from the food however is terrible we started with the eggplant cappicola it came out 22 minutes after we ordered it and i was flummoxed as to what i was supposed to do with these things they really didn t have any flavor at all and my husband said his portion was cold in the middle i ate about two bites of mine i ordered the shrimp giouvetsi on fillo when the waiter set this mess in front of me i was a little appalled the fillo dough was a soggy mess on the bottom and the edges were ridiculously thick the shrimp tomato artichoke concoction in the center of it tasted weird too much rosemary like tree branches of rosemary it was not ok my husband ordered the chicken astoria i tried a couple of the baby corns and the sauce wasn t bad but like mine the presentation was awful now don t get me wrong if food tastes good you could bring it to me in any presentation and i wouldn t scoff but none of this tasted good some of it was ok but none of it was good scratch that the side salad was good so there s that i won t be come back here 58 for a terrible appetizer 2 sub par entrees and one glass of wine i drank water is not worth the money and it took 90 minutes to get through this horrid meal not ok
  granted the prices are expensive but what on the strip isn t a three course meal with a bottle of wine for two will run you 250 300 advice make reservations come early and tip the host for the corner table if you d like the souffle for dessert order it the minute you sit down the chocolate or grand m are the best
  i consider myself a sushi connoisseur and all around foodie this place was everything we hoped for and then some the vibe is ultra hip vegas inside of caesars on the third floor of the forum shops we get there for our 9 30p reservations and promptly sat at a wonderful table with a view we wanted for nothing and the service was magnificant we had the sparkling blueberry sake amazing at 12 a shot we were a bit skeptical but it s so worth it we then ordered about 5 rolls in total but the two that stand out are the crab dynamite our favorite and the baked lobster roll was a close second just delectable there is nothing that i would have changed about this restaurant or experience and really glad it was recommended to us
  went here recently and had lunch small place right on tryon there is a private lot very fun place with music and lots of tables there is a tiny bar also service was excellent food is dominican mixes of all sorts of caribbean dishes i had a great chicken dish with veggies and it came with another whole plate of rice lettuce and fried plantains my boyfriend got a steak dish with onions that was similar to mine everything was pretty inexpensive and i definitely will come back and order some different options to try thanks guys
  this restaurant is located in the luxor hotel and casino on the upper level it is very open and not very secluded the tables seats were a bit unusual in the dining areas so i sat at the bar which was long and not busy about three others were sitting at the bar all spaced out for a sunday afternoon when i approached the hostess about seating at the bar she was a bit annoying about being 21 i understand that i look 12 but you do not be annoying about it i ignored her and went straight to the bar why would i show the hostess my id when i will just be bugged for it again at the bar i don t understand people anyways the food here is overpriced and the portions in my opinion were a bit off the bartender was unkempt and sniffling gross as well as complaining about other restaurants in the casino stating that the t t bar wouldn t last more than a year why do i care and why are you telling me about this i already am in here paying for an overpriced miso soup i have never paid over 3 00 for a relatively large portion of miso and my boyfriend s sesame chicken was gross and cold his chicken was actually served cold he was too hungry for me to say anything so he ate all of it but in the end we would tell everyone to go to pj changs or pei wei over this place
  i ve never had a slice of pizza there that i thought was any good and it s really not that cheap but it s adequate i guess
  i am torn about park i love the atmosphere and the free flowing aura of the place but am not impressed with the food offering the chicken and waffle sandwich is neat in concept and plays well with the finger food mentality of the place the drawback comes in the fact that the waffle was almost soggy and lukewarm the chicken is nothing impressive the choice of sides are decent we went with the potato salad and it was good they use egg in the mixture and that was very good as the night progressed i ordered the veggie pita wrap with a side of sweet potato tots this was better the warm pita stuffed full with cheese and a variety of grilled vegetables was much better the fact that they were removing items from their menu left us with little to choose from kind of hindered the dining experience the garden seating is amazing due to its alice in wonderland esque decor i would love to go back and take everything in hopefully the menu will be hashed out by then
  first time here we came for beer and appetizers we got the pizza rolls and pretzel nuggs the pizza rolls were okay but not great the pretzels were good i really like the cheese sauce the beer list was extensive but did not contain the one beer my husband wanted lagunitas sumpin sumpin
  if you re in the area and want a low key low cost delicious offering stop in the pel menis a cross between perogis and dumplings if you like meat don t waste your time getting the potato combo the meat is great if you also don t want to have to choose anything there s only meat and potato they make it easy for you treat yourself and order some
  awesome beer selection with super helpful staff joey was awesome at recommending things to try
  a new accidental discovery that is now a new favorite started off with a sampling of their cookies all fresh flavorful and deemed worthy to have again returned and am trying the hummus katayef and spanokita all very yummy in a town that has tons of mediterranean restaraunts this is now my favorite
  happy hour is the only draw for me for michael mina pub 1842 here we sampled duck spring rolls lobster grilled cheese and some pork sliders while each dish was tasty they were somewhat lacking in their primary ingredient particularly the duck and lobster when biting into the spring roll it was a struggle to actually taste any duck i really wanted to taste it too likewise with the lobster mac and cheese the texture of the lobster was evident but there was little flavor we received satisfactory service but the bar is very busy during happy hour and we were lucky to get a seat at the same time the manager offered to allow us to order happy hour at one of the tables even though that s normally not allowed
  love this place cool vibe fresh breads and unique options so good
  great service great atmosphere and a bar which is very great when you re waiting for a table during the busy hours on the other hand the food isn t great to me it s pretty bad the linguini with chopped clams was okay the spaghetti looked and tasted like it sat under the heat lamp all day the chicken parmegiana was dry my friend liked his veal marsala so i guess they can cook a steak the restaurant itself looks fantastic i love the menus and pictures on the brick walls they also have stories about the history of las vegas which is nice oh you also get free bread and wine free bread and wine never tastes bad so if you want to go to the restaurant for the ambiance then battista s is the place to eat at but if you re going for the food then maybe try somewhere else
  i am sooo happy they are open again because las vegas kbbq is truly lacking the last time i went to honey pig left a lot to be desired and i wasn t sure i d get kbbq again in las vegas i took my friend here for her b day and everything was great our server was super friendly and attentive she ran around pretty crazy because a table of at least 20 people walked in but she never forgot about us and her 2 other tables she mostly cooked all of our food for us with me just cutting things here and there and she refilled our drinks promptly she also brought our glasses of wine as soon as we ordered them i really was expecting the worst because of everyone else s reviews so i was super happy that we received such great service a party of one white girl and one very non korean asian girl the meats are great quality and i will definitely say one order of kalbi per person is definitely enough we actually only ordered one because there were other things we wanted as well and were way too stuffed it is the most delicious meat on the menu i ll say the marinade is very subtle and does not overpower the taste of the meat which is so tender and delicious
  let me start by saying i love this place it s close to my office the food is great and there is an asu visitor lot next door you can park there and as long as you take less than 15mins it s free the food is delicious it s fresh made and the ingredients are top quality i always get the 3 mozzarella salad grilled chicken and spring greens the space is small but they make good use of it and have a fairly structured line the overall cost varies based on what you are getting my average lunch runs about 12 you can easily get something much less expensive or more expensive i know you are wondering why i gave them 3 stars in my experience every time i have ordered in person or called in there is something off about my order usually phone orders are worse today for example i called in an order for an office mate and i and went to pick it up before getting off the phone i had the gentleman taking the order read it back to me he had the orders correct but when arriving to pick them up he had made both salads identical to one another whoever made the salad completely missed the mark and didn t pay attention to my order i saw the ticket and everything appeared to be correct on the order slip i m not sure what happened here my guess it does appear that many times things can be a bit chaotic behind the counter and the organization can be a bit lacking i figure two separate employees worked on the order and became confused about which order they were to make additionally the young man that rings you up is always confused but tries to be helpful if bog can work on their organization i m certain the ordering issues would be fixed with that said the owner manager is always eager to correct the issues and tries to make it right my order was still not 100 correct today but i didn t realize this until it was too late and i was back at the office i look forward to these issues getting smoothed out i don t think the establishment has been open that long and these issues won t keep me from coming back i ll just keep checking behind them until i see the problems fixed over a consistent period of time once they do fix these issues i look forward to editing my review
  this place is brand new and i was excited to give it a shot since it s right around the corner from where i work i ordered two full tacos fish shrimp pepper for lunch they were still installing the security system so they re still figuring things out based on their website this is their 1st and only location thus far the measures of good corn tortillas for me are are they fresh and do they fall apart and these are really good the fish and shrimp were fresh and tasty and the cheesy pepper was a nice touch the salsa bar is nicely stocked with different salsas condiments similar to what you d find in mexico the menu is simple and reasonable definitely worth checking out if you re in the neighborhood
  easily one of my favorite authentic mexican food spots the menu has everything one could ever crave and the salsa bar provides a wide range of choices i have been looking for a great down home authentic mexican joint for three years i finally found it perfect
  the food was alright i had lunch here a few times during my stay it is very affordable and their dishes are big size
  in mgm this is one of the places where we went to eat this place has nothing exceptional to offer it has a feel of a diner with a service that really doesnt help it either eat here only if you need to save time otherwise there are plenty of places in vegas where you can get a better return on your money
  you just can t beat an italian beef hot and sweet with provolone heart stopping oily crunchy beefy goodness i ve been going here for nearly 15 years and it s a good thing i don t live close by luke s because it would considerably shorten my lifespan
  i use to like this place because they had lunch ayce specials for about 5 i haven t been here for about a year but for some reason today it was around 10 i was already there so i just paid and expected greatness it was slow for the lunch time and not much selection to pick from and it look like its been out for a while all dry and hard i ate and took my time just to see if the new stuff would ever make it out they did half a pizza but it was all watered down light on the toppings real light on them weird restaurant layout they have a huge eating area at least a 100 people but their food area was big enough to fit a soda machine 2 pizza and a small salad bar how would it be when this place is packed then again i ve seen places like this have fast service before so its possible it may seem that cici s pizza could have stole some of their business i think they re about 3 never tried them yet for 10 i could have gone some place better or at least gotten 2 little caesar pizzas based on pass experience i won t rate them lower
  the morning ride will serve you well it s 2 meals in 1 who could resist a bacon egg breakfast on top of your burger it is delicious and incredibly messy be sure to wash it down with plenty of suds
  so i m from kentucky and jus let me tell you bein in this place totally made me feel like i was back home and i loved it i had a few things a la carte cuz i wanted i try everything to drink i got an arnold palmer with unsweet tea don t tell anyone in ky i did that and one of my friends ordered the kool aid it tasted just like a watermelon jolly rancher she loved it because they cook all the chicken to order it takes a good amount of time to get your food we were also there on a sunday after church so there was a pretty long wait jus don t expect to be in a hurry is all one thing i will say was a downfall though was how darn hot it was in there it was almost uncomfortably hot they are moving to a new location soon though so hopefully that will fix it to eat i had the fried okra a thigh a waffle and mac an cheese i also tried bites of cornbread and red velvet cake my favorite part was probably the waffle and a close second the okra everything was super hot and delicious i can t wait to go back and try everything i didn t get to try this time
  happy to say that they got a review bump from me i came looking for seafood station but it looks like they closed shop walked around and figured i would give sal s another try since i didn t have a huge appetite i wanted to try a sandwich instead of going crazy with a bbq platter i went with the austin city sandwich which is a texas style smoked brisket with cheddar cheese texas bbq sauce and crispy onion straws the brisket was cooked well and had lots of smokey flavor and was a very large portioned sandwich great deal for 6 99 too i will ask for extra bbq sauce next time since i really like their sauce and it wasn t messy enough for me i ll probably come back for the sandwiches alone though give them a try if you are in the neighborhood
  while british food is not my favorite this place is pretty good the decor is a little dark and there s a bar out front with tables in the back food is what you would expect you leave feeling full and satisfied but nothing to write home about tip huge portions i d suggest sharing or expect to have take out boxes
  good bbq please chicago style well maybe only if you are from chicago and you prepared it it should be called sam s style as in sam s club ok heres the layout i ordered a rack of ribs mac cheese greens cole slaw and potato salad rack of ribs i received a full rack i give them that but it was a mixed rack baby backs and a spare ribs what is that called mac cheese so so greens unseasoned strait from the can at least they could have sprinkled a lil salt pepper on em ya know cole slaw strait from a plastic container potato salad need i say more building dirty inside and out sanitation grade 90 1 two words keep driving
  pretty decent chinese food on this side of town their egg foo young is always cooked perfectly and the gravy for it is just right we usually get their seafood combination and it comes with shrimp lobster and an assortment of vegetables their fried rice is not greasy at all you get free egg rolls with your meal
  excellent food reasonable prices
  really good food awesome prices great ambiance and really nice customer service
  my dad is addicted to mcd s i think every time after my test and scans at the mayo clinic it is let s go to mcd s we found this one pretty close and easy to get back on the 101 this location was clean and the staff was friendly they walked our order out to us of course the food taste the same
  this is just the kind of restaurant i love outstanding food at a very reasonable price fast and friendly service with no pretentious atmosphere or attitude it s just a small family working their butts off to serve up a great variety of indian favorites in a high quality way and lots of indian families come here to eat which attests to the authenticity and quality
  bbq chicken wrap with an extra serrano chili for me and the italian cold cut for him every time i don t even like bbq sauce but they seem to go light on the sauce which works for me i deviated once and ordered a shrimp protein bowl but i just wasn t feeling it and was left regretting my decision to skip the wrap it just wasn t flavorful enough the pineapple mojito juice is the yummiest i have to take away one star for the quality of take out maybe it was an outlier but everything just seemed sloppily made they aren t consistent with the extra serrano either
  high quality sushi a great staff and an all around joy to dine at the place is small and fills up quickly so either include a wait into your plans or show up early alcohol is byob as they do not have a liquor license it can get somewhat noisy form conversation but they do not play loud music like some other places in the valley like ra their tako salad is wonderful the best i ve had since zen32 closed tuna tataki is also outstanding
  one of my favorite sub places for sure they have such an assortment of sandwiches the subs are all toasted and you can fix them up with whatever you want way more options than subway the food and meats are fresh the food doesn t even really compare to most sub shops the only thing that sucks about this location is the seating this place is really small so it s only good for you and a friend unless you want to sit on the wall bar i crave this place all the time though so i go there often despite the seating
  very good food but not a place to go if you are in a hurry habib is a very gracious host and explains the entire menu to you if you are a first timer it is a very nice restaurant with classy decor definately a good place for a fancier dinner date or somewhere to go if you plan on having a conversation with your dinner companions all of the reccomendations by habib were wonderful dishes i had the lamb and it was so moist and tender and the rice was a fantastic combination of spices and herbs like i ve never had before the hummus was ok and the pita bread warm and fresh if i m in vegas again i would definately go back
  my husband and i have tried sushi in many places in wi many in milwaukee blegh appleton meh and up till now one other spot in madison bummer but we had the fortuitous chance to have red sushi alas only for lunch on our recent trip but it was a beacon in the dark not only is it dark and cozy inside i love all the red and our waitress was very pleasant we both had miso soup salty and good with just enough stuff good flavor i thought and the chef picks 6 sushi you pick one roll option my husband picked the spicy salmon roll with avocado and the sauce it came on was a delicious rendition divergent of normal spicy mayo sauce i ordered the crunchy tuna roll with avocado jalapeno cucumber and wasabi aoila sans crunch i was kinda bummed as the wasabi aoili had no real flavor or kick and the jalapeno was no surprise though i should have known seedless and not spicy still the fish was fresh and the tastes were all good as for the sushi of course the salmon was king what gave all six pieces a really nice touch was the delicacy of the tiny tobiko and scallions on top i felt like the chefs went the extra mile to care for their sushi and its presentation if we make it back for dinner i m excited to try the specialty rolls i mean triple decker sounds awesome as does the buddha and well the list goes on really glad we had a good lunch here as of now the best sushi we ve had in this state thanks red sushi
  taco tuesday is awesome here place is delicious great amount of beers as well the atmosphere is great patron bottles as the hanging lights the colors are great the bartenders are hot haha the outside seating is on a bank of sand which is pretty cool overall i enjoy this place to catch the football game or just to grab a few brews with some friends service lacked a little last night but it s a bar good bar though
  really great food for such a tiny place don t blink when you drive in i get my car worked on next door and use this as an excuse to get a burger or a milk shake but i truly don t need an excuse if you are hungry for a good burger do not hesitate to check this little place out good fries and tacos too everything is fresh and full of flavor the staff are all helpful and really friendly get the stand sauce too my favorite meal is the double burger with fries if you are in the mood for something else the tacos are so flavorful you won t be disappointed they are soft and the meat is marinated next time you are in the hood don t miss this little family owned gem
  4 stars for my overall smokehouse favorites 5 stars for phx up to this point on my continual quest for savory smoked grilled and bbq goodness i decided to stop in i initially entered the q lounge to check out the happy hour which obviously has a huge following and offered a hh buffet and numerous drink specials while interesting and entertaining i wasn t feelin it so after about an hour i wandered back into the main restaurant taking a seat at the bar i ordered up a rather potent and tasty margarita and looked over the menu decisions this looked promising the wonderful smoke aroma mildly permeating the restaurant gave me further hope that i was getting into something good opting for the 2 meat combo with brisket and sausage with roasted corn and mac n cheese on the side i was looking forward to the meal served relatively quickly i stuck my fork into the mac n cheese i was told it had 5 cheeses it was quite rich with a very velveeta like palate and a slight tang of cheddar the corn was truly roasted cut off the cob and served up neatly in a bowl the brisket was tender smokey and amazing well marbled not too lean and not too fatty the smoked sausage was not overly smoked well seasoned and with just enough bite i will have to try the jalapeno variety next time to compare the serving size was plentiful and i had enough left over for the next day still not rudy s my quest continues
  the pizza was good as always normally i get the 16 pickup special for 7 99 i could not leave the house so i ordered delivery i ordered the 18 today because i was expecting company however when i got the pizza it was the 16 i called napoli and they proceeded to tell me it was 18 and to look on the box there was no markings on the box they totally ripped me off not to mention it was almost 22 and that s without a tip needless to say i will not be going back there no matter how good the pizza is
  the sandwiches are great as are the prices the fact that so many reviews here comment on the post apocalyptic setting shows the lamentable suburban charlotte mindset that everything needs to be tidy safe and predictable this is why chalotte is such a poster child for chain restaurants conformity and lack of creativity this mall is a good look into the 3rd world and has nothing to fear the cheap real estate is a blessing that attracts unique restaurants shops and wonderful ethnic diversity in other cities there would be a thriving artist scene in this area with galleries music venues etc and would be rushing for gentrification then the 4 sandwich would be 9 95 like in ballantyne huntersville etc i ve been going to this mall for years mainly to shop the amazing asian african food markets it s a wonderful cultural island and i hope it stays this way including potholes to keep out the moneyed riff raff
  very close to the original in terms of layout and design perhaps a bit smaller kind of far from the strip good spot if you are staying at the hard rock casino food was great beer a bit pricey but it is vegas we felt like the server pushed a 13 bretzel on us even before we had a chance to look at the menu and the oktoberfest beer it was like it was going bad and they were trying to sell it before it went bad beer was good and being vegetarian we ordered 5 side dishes to split we each had a masse litre stein 32 oz of beer our bill came to around 100 expect to spend between 35 50 per person if you eat and have a drink or two great spot to take a large group to drink if you want something different
  definitely my go too place when in the area and craving tempura i love love there batter and size of shrimp they use good tempura sauce and like the size and variety of tempura vegetables it helps balance out everything and i enjoy it with regular white rice they offer other rice options for those who want to be healthier but hey many asians in the world who live long and eat white rice daily who am i to say white rice is unhealthy moderation is the key hehe i also like there jumping rice especially with pork but many protein options
  this place looks cool from the outside so i decided to give it a shot don t think i ll be back the food is not really mexican food more of american food the bloody mary i had was not good it was missing everything i would say but our bartender was really efficient
  i usually avoid chain restaurants but i have a weakness for chang s at least they started in scottsdale so it is a home town company this location is a little different than others and i really appreciate it there are fabulous touches like the glass wall mural that really step the place up the food is consistently great and the service staff are always friendly i m currently hooked on a sweet dish i never would have considered from the menu its shrimp honeydew melon and walnuts and is absolutely delicious every person i go there with looks at me questioningly then thanks me for ordering it because they never would have sweet isn t your thing try the fabulously spicy bloody mary to really really kick up your night yum update new management less consistent quality and service however even though its a chinese chain they have one of the best margaritas i ve had anywhere in arizona go figure
  ok i realize this should not be a surprise but in a stupor of holiday exhaustion i ordered a pan normous pizza for me and my kids my children apparently already slaves to advertising really wanted to try it it turned out to be a good education for the difference between what something looks like on tv versus real life i am sure there is a deep life lesson here but i was too irritated to take advantage of it there was nothing enormous about the pizza which is my main complaint i asked the guy on the phone how many people it would feed he said 8 ummm 8 tiny people it was also not good but again not surpised at that so i think i will be thankful that now my kids know how gross pizza hut is too
  my wife and i stopped here for a brunch time breakfast you order at the counter and then sit down they bring your food out to you i had the cinnamon roll french toast and my wife had the crepes with a side of potatoes both were delicious it was tough finishing both because they are both on the rich side but the taste was great the only reasons i m downgrading this to a 3 star experience staff attitude and utensils condiments the staff wasn t rude but no one was friendly either it was just blah type attitude this probably would ve made the experience a lot better when you go to a small mom and pop type restaurant you sort of expect them to be friendly and treat you differently than a chain we didn t get that here at all the second thing was the utensils and condiments the utensils were plastic which seemed odd and wasteful there was a single station for getting the utensils and napkins the condiments were two bottles of hot sauce and that was it we had to ask for ketchup for the potatoes which came in a small little cup the place has a decent amount of seating so it just seemed an odd choice for the setup i will most likely be back for some of the bakery items i m not sure i ll be back to sit down and eat again this place may do great business i m really don t know but i would guess they would do a lot better with a couple of small changes
  we were doing some shopping in the west island before heading off for a birthday party stopped here to get a bite food was good served quickly and efficiently our server was fantastic kept asking if everyone was happy and if he could do anything that service is truly appreciated
  food express is my go to chinese restaurant when i m in las vegas a lot of regulars come here instead of the busy spring mountain hub bub as do i because the people here truly appreciate the business when you walk inside their doors unlike some others in the chinatown area the people here are really nice and despite not having been there awhile they know when you been there before it s nice to be recognized as a regular now don t let the name fool you this is no panda express this is a real chinese restaurant that just so happens to make your food fast hence the name food express chinese restaurant although i ve tried a lot of dishes here the one dish that makes me keep coming back for more is the eggplant w garlic sauce clay pot you cant pass it up trust me i would also recommend the chicken corn flour soup and roast duck i can t ever see myself going to food express and not order at least one of those items good people and good food what more do you need
  shaika cafe has an amazing community vibe complete with gallery and event space inside and a patio with a view out the staff are always amazing and there s so much to see and do whether you re in or out making it a great place to spend your afternoon food is spot on healthy with lots of veggie options and always extremely fresh if you are looking for an interesting space to get some work done shaika is great for that as well its generally quiet without feeling constrictive although quiet thankfully quits when the live music starts some evenings service is efficient and always with a smile
  in the past few months maybe since september 2012 this place has gone downhill the quality of dishes served on the lunch buffet is not the same as it once was because i always make it a point to eat here during lunch this is a huge issue the difference has been noticed by several people that i dine here with who now refuse to eat here anymore the first time i noticed it i thought maybe they were just having an off day i came in for lunch 3 more times over the past few months with other people because we were in the area but it was unmistakable the food here is not nearly as good as it used to be i noticed that there is one gentleman that always worked here that is no longer here and i suspect this has something to do with the change i truly hope the food gets better but i won t be back in to find out any time soon with so many other options nearby
  i love this place i use to come here once a week they have so many selections of teas its crazy cute little bar so you can sit with friends and drink the staff is always friendly and talkative love it
  ok in a pinch 1st time i called for take out they didn t answer weeks later i tried again nothing exotic basic sausage onion bland skimpy distribution of meat veggie while neighbors rave i prefer buon gusto just down the road doubtful return
  this is the 2nd visit for me the first didn t go so well but i was there at an off time so i decided to give it another chance we arrived in the rain after being told on the phone that the kitchen was still serving on a weeknight around midnight they were in fact still serving the entire menu we ordered sliders and pretzels with beer mustard and of course beers they were both good standard bar food served with a smile they had a band playing and some kind of game club playing cards everyone seemed to be having a great time including me and the 2 others with me there were obviously many locals here some in their pj s how could the neighborhood folks be wrong
  this is a unique place your first impression is sketchy type of place you would only go in with a recommendation or if you were local i m glad we got a recommendation because this was a good eat i had the burrito norteno with green chilli very good shark and shrimp tacos for the rest of the table and it all looked good with good comments this is a small place with only ten tables and a small bar the service is quick despite obvious take out orders and a full dining room salsa is homemade and presented in tupperware on an ice bar with a ton of different choices ambiance is interesting true to its name tip o the hat coke served in glass bottles wage of the finger find a better presentation for your awesome salsas
  i stepped in here and i felt like i was back in san diego this is what a real taco shop should be if you want the same stuff on a fancy plate and want to pay more go to leticia s which sucks salsa is good hot carrots are good service is friendly only complaint is the hours i showed up at 8am on saturday wanting a breakfast burrito and it was closed pretty upset about that business hours not posted on the door either
  my husband and i recently went to roy s while staying at the jw i had read the other reviews on yelp and thought it would make for a nice evening what a complete disappointment the food was not good and the price tag only made matters worse i had the blackened ahi which was served with a lump of flavorless cold white rice my husband who is not a fish eater went for the chicken breast which was also cold and remarkably bland luckily the meal was preceeded by a nice strong martini and excellent service which is the only reason this review is landing two stars instead of one
  i have been going to this olive garden for more then 10 years and i love it the service is always helpful and they always seat us asap my family always goes to olive garden to unwind and the food is always amazing
  i go all the time the food is my favorite and will continue to return i recommend the food and will always love it
  i came in with a group of 10 for drinks and appetizers after the artwalk we were all shocked that a new place could be this bad for example incredibly skimpy servings for very hi prices wine pours are the smallest you have ever seen at any establishment and at 9 a glass we ordered guac chips and could not believe the small anount oif chips in the bowl cmon how can you skimp on chips another person at the table also ordered it and again it came out with a few chips scattered on the bottom the guac tasted really odd and when i looked i saw it had a lot of goat cheese on top yuk thankfully our waitress brought me out some guac with no cheese she said she was sympathetic because she was a vegan i left her a good tip i hope she got it there were plenty of servers but the food took forever to come out our fries came out cold and mushy and tasteless and one person ordered a bottle of beer she was given a glass of beer that was completely flat not one bubble it must have been sitting on the counter for hours to be that flat when she asked the server why she did not get the bottle she ordered he said we don t serve in a bottle we pour it into a glass for you did not ask if she wanted a bottle or ask how is it let s insult the customers intelligence in additon to insulting their taste buds do not go there let them go out of business asap
  we wanted something quick but not fast food and saw this place thought we would try it we were pleasantly surprised we had the chicken fingers and were very happy with them they were crispy and tender at the same time they were breaded there at the restaurant not prepackaged they were delicious and came with a large order of deliciously crispy french fries my 19 year old son actually went out of his way to take his friend there on another occasion so they could get chicken fingers there again because hes always looking for good chicken fingers and was craving theirs the owner was very nice and stopped by our table to see how we were doing you can tell he takes pride in his business and really wants it to be a success very comfortable atmosphere
  we have been there several times service is good food just okay wings are good good local place w atmosphere but i wouldn t drive out of my way too many other restaraunts to spend my money when i go out to eat
  it s so hard to find good vegetarian and vegan restaurants and i wish i would have discovered this place sooner great atmosphere and friendly staff the environment decor tastes and smells make me feel like i am back in the islands i am officially making this my new favorite place to eat in north scottsdale
  when i frequent las vegas i make it a priority to dine at texas de brazil this 5 star review is so deserving and here s why let s get this out of the way first reservations are mandatory this place is busy every day of the week so don t be a fool and make sure you book a reservation to get seated the service is very professional and exceeds expectations from the host staff to the waiters and food carvers every person that works here makes sure that every guest is served at a level of perfection the food meat galore i pretty much die and go to heaven when i eat here the flank steak and filets are amazing the lobster bisque is a party in your mouth hell even the cheesy bread is glorified hallelujah if you somehow can fit dessert in your expansive stomach you can t go wrong with their extensive choices overall i would say texas de brazil tops my food establishment choices in the country at 50 a head it s actually worth it
  greatl place to have a hookah but do not come if ur trying to enjoy sunday night football with a hookah who doesnt have nbc i thought that was a basic cable channel
  the boule is unmatched anywhere in town it induced a brief and poignant moment of proustian reverie the baguette is also a good facsimile to what i remember in its homeland the croissant flies into a million flakes on first bite this is a good thing the strip mall is a draw back for any dine in
  i had a chicken sandwich with a house salad the food was very fresh and flavorful but we were a little up set by the service it was so slow that the appetizer came after the food probably won t be back anytime soon
  i love this place and i m slightly bias because i come here so much everyone in this joint knows me by name don t get fancy and try to order thai or chinese food here stick to the vietnamese food i like their pho pork chops and cubed steak this place does get a little rowdy the later it gets into the am partiers can t beat that it s 24hrs
  i m rounding up but i think bobbee s is a 3 5 i ordered a half rack for a late lunch with collards and corn cobblettes never heard that term aka 1 2 an ear of corn on the cob they give you a true 1 2 rack so it s a large portion i thought the taste was above average no heavy smokey flavor but not bland either however the texture was perfection literally fall off the bone ribs that melt in your mouth they took their time cooking these the service as average as i got takeout also note that this is a smaller establishment and nothing fancy but serves its purpose if you want to sit down and eat get the feeling it s more geared towards takeout
  went to this place for lunch and was impressed a big selection of food to choose from very clean and a friendly and attentive staff loved the lo mein and those little donut things with sugar yum
  well i m surprised they offer a brunch menu i actually only thought it was a bar come to find out they have a dining room next door seems kind of like a diner which brings me to my next point it was okay diner food the brunch menu actually looked pretty promising with some delicious looking breakfast sandwiches since i wanted something a bit lighter i went with the omelet loaded with veggies and cheddar cheese i didn t realize it came with potatoes until i got it in front of me plus toast which is nice but i wish i would have been told from my server so i could have ordered wheat if they had it the omelet was okay but the veggies were still kinda hard like it wasn t cooked very long and the homefries weren t very crispy which in my opinion is the best way to do them so here s the weird thing everyone ended up getting their food in shifts we had a party of 8 so it was pretty large but we were literally the only party in there other than another four top first shift got their breakfast sandwiches they d eaten most of their meal by the time the second shift got their waffles the third shift was 3 people who d ordered omelets it just seemed odd that it took so long in between i wouldn t have noticed much if it was by a few minutes but it was a good fifteen or more it wasn t horrible because there was good company but it definitely wasn t the best service i d had not sure about the bar area of hambone s but i probably wouldn t come back for brunch
  not the kind of place i would normally go but we visited searsucker recently for a yelp party and i was actually very impressed with the food and service the bartenders know their job very well and the wine selection is very good this is definitely one of those high priced upscale places but if that is what you re looking for searsucker manages to be elegant but not snobby
  good food decent price customer service almost non existent shake machine seems to brake a lot but still eat here 1 2 month for the food
  still am a fan of this place but i have to revoke my sushi recommendation the last three times i ve gone their sushi has been absolutely horrible not fresh but fishy messy bleh what happened to my sushi fondu roll you use to be so good bummer i m not sure if they changed fish vendors or sushi chef s but please go back to what you had before pretty please i do have a few new recommendations though shrimp ceviche hell yes light coconut flavor served with a plantain chip mmmm also the mojitos are delicious i wish they added some fruit varieties besides mango too sweet for me but they are definitely worth having served in a pint glass not some dinky small glass
  really good pizza but if i were to do it again i would order a large pizza put it in the fridge for 2 hours and heat up individual slices on aluminum foil or a pizza stone for 5 minutes at 475 f something magical happens sounds crazy but i actually enjoy those guys pies twice as much on the reheat it becomes perfectly crispy and chewy as real pizza should be not all pizza reacts this way but real nj ny pizza does this is meant to be a compliment to those guys pies give it try experience the alchemy
  summary meat the meat was excellent and cooked just right they were thick juicy and simply flavorful value you re getting a lot of bang for your buck the two items listed below are both meals they come with two sides each and a salad in most other steak houses you re paying 40 for just the entree chocolate chip bread the best bread i ve ever tasted ordered 28 16oz king cut salt pepper crusted prime rib super tender thick slice of prime rib with just the right amount of seasoning on the side http www yelp com biz_photos jcr xc4nqoeajjmstqx8sa select _irp_iwyoxhp05rdshqhaw 29 18oz bourbon bbq bone in rib eye not as good or tender as the prime rib they use a dry rub and i don t really like that type of seasoning http www yelp com biz_photos jcr xc4nqoeajjmstqx8sa select ogaiihjhqy mqjo2pbycja sides you only get three stalks of asparagus the brocollini was about the same the mac and cheese had bread crusting on top but seemed a little bland the mash was good though artisan breads you get a cheesy cracker pretzel bread a bread with chocolate chips baked in and some other bread the chocolate bread goes on my top five carbs list i ate the two they had in a bowl and when offered more ate another four it s that good http www yelp com biz_photos jcr xc4nqoeajjmstqx8sa select vh_0zlq0fczo1isghobcwg recommendations i d recommend this place if you re looking for a fancy steakhouse experience without the fancy steakhouse price
  stopped by for lunch with a fellow yelper the other day heard this was an organic healthy vegan vegetarian hangout that also served the carnivores so i was eager to give it a try and see what it feels like to be a vegan in a steakhouse since i m a carnivore this was one of the most difficult reviews for me to write this place has so much potential i wish there was a 1 2 star system because i want to give it 3 5 stars and was on the fence for 3 or 4 stars here s why the menu is pretty extensive and has a lot of items that pique d my interest such as grilled chicken soft tacos 12 95 buffalo chicken wrap 7 99 pepperoni pizzetta 8 95 wait what s a pizzetta turns out it s a pizza come on enough with the goofy names already just call it a pizza and call it a day a lot of stuff looked good and i was surprised at the number of items available for carnivores i ended up ordering their fire fries baked fries topped with hot sauce pico de gallo mozzarella cheddar cheese 7 and a chicken panini w buffalo mozzarella tomato basil with pesto 7 95 the server asked if i wanted the vegan cheese on the fire fries i passed and wanted the full monty to wash it down i had some iced tea 2 50 which was awesome btw the service was a bit slow it took some time for the waiter to take our order and the table next to us had to stop a busperson to get their order taken too it was 11 30 am and the lunch rush hadn t started yet so i don t know what the issue was anyway it wasn t too bad but was borderline annoying another few minutes and it would have cost them a star our food came out after a short wait and i was surprised to see how huge the fire fries were i thought this was suppose to be a healthy restaurant lol for a minute i thought i was in claim jumper the fries look too good so i attacked them first the top layer of fire fries were awesome baked well and had good flavor however the middle and bottom portion of the fries were undercooked and semi raw not good also the cook didn t spread the ingredients throughout the dish the hot sauce and pico de gallo was only in one corner of the dish buried under the top layer of cheese the other 3 4 of the dish was only melted cheese and the fries this was a damn shame because the portion with all of the ingredients was awesome the rest of it was just so so he she needs a lesson in making a consistent dish the chicken panini was next after i took one bite i realized i made a big mistake the combination of fire fries and the chicken panini wasn t good the sharp spicy flavor of the fire fries overwhelmed my taste buds so when i ate my chicken panini it tasted bland this is not the restaurant s fault but mine so my review of the panini is incomplete the side salad with balsamic vinaigrette was awesome though another note the panini came with whole grain bread as a default i wasn t given an option for any other type of bread but saw other people with panini s with what appeared to be white bread wish i had the choice overall this place has a lot of potential that s what made it so difficult for me to rate it the 1 4 of the fries that had all of the ingredients and were cooked thoroughly tasted awesome but the raw potatoes in the middle was a turn off for now they get 4 stars for their vegan vegetarian menu options and the potential of their fire fries will i return i will someday to try a couple more items that intrigued me
  had breakfast here about 3 days after it opened so i wasn t expecting much yet the breakfast menu is simple with a good variety i had the frittata which was good but not extraordinary hashbrowns needed some seasoning i would recommend sending management and the cooking staff on a little field trip to some of the better rated breakfast spots here in henderson like the cracked egg or pancake house and do a little research it doesn t cost a lot to make a good breakfast better and what harry s needs to be is a draw for the casino which it isn t in the current state i have friends that drive all the way to boulder from lake las vegas to get breakfast at the coffee cup which isn t anything special but the place is always busy for some reason harry s needs to lower the breakfast prices a little and create a signature dish like a lot of the other breakfast establishments here in vegas have as a draw
  been coming here for a year and a half came on opening night and was blown away by the beer selection and it has only gotten better they used to change the taps a little more often but their selection never disappoints service can be spotty sitting at the bar is your best bet all the pies are great but beware of the price if you make your own
  love the carne asada tacos which come in corn tortillas and are served with guacamole caramelized onions and lettuce i usually order three and after my second i start to think maybe my eyes were bigger than my stomach but then i polish the third off anyway the guacamole is awesome i split an order of chips and guac and between our meals and that as a side it was too much so i took the guacamole back to the office and it was still great the next day
  this place does hoagies right they pack plenty of meat in the sandwiches and use plenty of fresh vegetables i ordered the pastrami destroyer and was amazed by how much i got i m not usually a sandwich person but was told that this was a must try in pittsburgh it didn t disappoint at all because i inhaled it like it was nothing too bad this place is kinda out of the way or i would be eating here much more often
  we had great service and food from jason my sister and daughter thought their steaks were delicious my son and i thought our salmon was equally delicious good value for great food on the strip
  great food good drinks close to asu i seem to be becoming a regular wish their drink prices on happy hours were worth it though
  decided to try out a local tavern nice clean neighborhood type bar good tvs for game watching ventilation system not good at all hit by massive smoke while entering i stayed anyway to try the happy hour food ordered beef sliders and fries damn good drink was good too overall a great place to hang out if you don t mind smelling like smoke
  always quick to serve quick to seat never less than 10 min wait hot tastey food with great people julie is our fav server sooo friendly attentive
  it s a shame the service was so horrible since the beer was delicious we had to wait 45 min for our meals and the only time our waitress came to the table was to introduce herself and give us the tab the food was pretty good but not 80 dollars worth the manager was friendly and understanding maybe on a differant night the experience would have been better it sucks that 1 waitress can ruin an entire dining experience especially it being the first time any of the 4 of us were there probably going to be the last time too i would imagine it would be a cool place to visit if you were going just for the beer and maybe an appetizer
  during the day food is marginal at best but margaritas are fantastic the service is nothing to brag about at night usually a long wait to get in unless you are a mill rat fun high energy usually pretty good music cheap drinks my only gripe is the amount of people they let in at once it s an ordeal to attempt to walk across the bar when it s busy to use the bathroom just a fair warning you will be elbowed spilled on and occasionally shoved bottom line it was a sad day when canteen closed
  great subs friendly service just as good as ned s but steve s has root beer ice cream and you can watch them make the samiches never had a better sub than their 12 hot turkey on white with everything kids love their pizza boat too
  i m giving this place a very generous 3 stars b c of the view it was really nice and the music was great they are lucky they had that going for them b c the rest of it not so good my husband and i checked out the menu online before our trip and basically decided on what we were going to get we also checked the dress code which stated business casual i wore a dress i never wear dresses and my husband wore a suit jacket and a nice button up shirt with nice slacks we walked over to binion s and finally found the correct elevator after asking a few employees and made our way up to the top no glass elevator everything was going good thus far the maitre d this guy was wearing a ring on every finger he looked like an old school mafia boss or pimp lol seemed a little smug but we were expecting that since this was supposed to be a nice place in our reservations i stated that this was a special occasion and asked for a table by the windows if available they accommodated us with this great table right next to the windows kind of off by ourselves great view great music no one directly next to us everything was perfect so far our waiter started off great but we didn t actually see him for the rest of our meal until he brought the check more on that in a second i ordered the petite filet and my husband ordered the chicken fried lobster since they are supposed to be famous for it remember me saying we had looked at the menu beforehand well they need to update their menu prices online everything was like 10 to 20 more on their actual menu than they had quoted online i know inflation happens but come on update your website money wasn t an object but still update a few minutes after ordering a loud table of 4 was seated right next to us there were a ton of open tables a few feet away why couldn t they have gone over there they were not busy so i don t think it would have been an issue for our section s waiter to walk an extra 4 feet anyway the loud table was sat next to us and they were all dressed in motorcycle tshirts and old jeans with baseball hats i noticed a few more tables coming in with ratty looking tshirts and holey jeans i think we were the only table dressed up i am not a snob people can wear whatever they want but i put on a dress and heels b c it was supposed to be business casual so i think they could have come in with a freaking polo shirt on or something and the snobby maitre d didn t say anything maybe they tipped him who knows ok so the loud table next to us all ordered water and they managed to get better service from the wait staff than we did we ordered drinks i heard what they ordered how could i not and our 2 person check was going to be more than their 4 person check and our waiter was kissing their asses as i said before we only saw our waiter when he took our order and when he dropped off the check we didn t get a refill until my husband tried to refill his water himself they had giant bottles of water sitting off to the side and out of the 3 waiters workers we saw walking around no one asked how our meal was they sure as hell asked the table next to us how everything was multiple times on the the food the filet was burnt charred severely i asked for medium not black it didn t even taste like a filet i think they gave me the scraps from someone else s steak the potatoes were the best thing on my plate sadly the house salad was drenched in dressing which would normally we fine but there was so much that i couldn t finish it my husband got the caesar and he seemed to enjoy it his chicken fried lobster was gross we ve both had better fried seafood from long john silvers or red lobster the lobster itself was just not good my husband will usually push through something he doesn t like b c he s paying for it but he wouldn t even finish this dish i told him to send it back but we would have had to see a waiter for that to have even happened 20 or so minutes went by with us sitting there waiting for a waiter to come back to ask how our meal was neither of us had touched very much on our plates that should have been a sign to the wait staff that something was wrong clue number 2 would have been us looking around for someone that worked there i m serious if the mafia looking maitre d had not been outside we would have dined and dashed it was that bad we stayed and paid and gave a fair tip even though we shouldn t have given our waiter anything b c he didn t do anything and on our way out we passed 2 employees and the maitre d no one said thanks for coming in enjoy your night kiss my ass nothing we will not be back i am big on service and this place sucked big time
  like every restaurant in the cosmopolitan even the cosmo itself comme ca is artfully presented and beautiful to sit in and look at there s outdoor seating overlooking the strip and the right amount of lighting to take the strip in the noise level is moderate and a nice break from the general din in lv as a californian i found the seared foie gras heavenly so heavenly that i had two of them the glazed onion alongside was wonderful with the duck confit in a crisp wrap the steak tartare is wonderfully seasoned and perfect on the grilled bread before that i go through a dozen kumamoto oysters i ve also had brunch here there are good offerings i did go the healthy route and enjoyed their oatmeal service is attentive casual and friendly the offer a good wine list and will probably make or bring whatever you d like to have if you asked for it
  very good dining experience service was friendly and fast the food was hot flavorful and well seasoned
  a very nice modern and cool wine bar in the monte carlo hotel while i was only there for a short time the service and vibe was top notch the bar manager ashley was so sweet and personable and really made my group feel welcome she was also so instrumental in providing some great dining and entertainment suggestions while my friends and i were in town will visit here again
  awesome beer and alcohol selection even more amazing food mussels salmon steak beer cheese soup macaroni gratin are among my favorites the quality is outstanding and everything is always cooked perfectly never disappoints
  felt at home in this place since its all japanese korean and hawaiian we were greeted by russell the owner who was incredibly friendly got some good hot tea and ordered a combo plate and the spicy cold noodles side order of meat jun and a spam musubi he brought us some fresh hot fried dumplings that were really really good he said they came with the combo plate but i think he was just being nice and letting us try so good also brought us some kimchi that was really good too food came out quick and hot good size portion plate everything on combo plate was delicious meat jun is really really bomb you just need to dip it in the sauce surprised by the spicy cold noodle dish my girlfriend ordered wow it was super good best part of the whole experience was great service and homestyle family feel russell asked us if we lived in the area and we told him no we had a long drive back home he boxed up the leftovers real nice for us and then reached in the cooler and hooked it up with two cold bottles of water for the car ride dude what at nice guy yea thanks again russell that little bit of aloha really made the 9 hour drive home a lot better and my stomach was happy the whole way we will be back to see you overtime were in vegas mahalo
  we were in las vegas over the summer and as you can guess it was hot we were not able to get into our hotel for a few more hours the world cup was on t v and we were hungry what to do what to do find a place that has the game on and some decent food that didn t cost an arm and a leg and find it quick we checked out a few places but wound up at margaritaville i don t know about decor and such but the food was great the price was right and the service from fran the bartender perfect we were able to sit at the bar watch the game and enjoy our lunch and some tasty margaritas they even had a sample tray where we tried four 5 oz margaritas perfect for me who was trying margaritas for the first time wasn t sure i would love them but i did as i said before fran the bartender made the whole experience perfect when we sat at the bar he asked what he could get us to drink i said i need food now drinks later he was quick to take our order get it into the kitchen and before i knew it i was happily eating my lunch followed up by those tasty 5oz margaritas i meantioned earlier we enjoyed the whole experience and would happily return anytime we are in the area
  wowzers great handcrafted burgers i can t wait to go back to vegas you can be sure bachi burger will be first on my list to eat at for starters we ordered the oxtail chili fries they were delicious and come with a fried egg on top a must try for anyone we also ordered the brussel sprouts and they too were delicious burgers ordered ronin burger the banh mi burger black green burger kikis burger each burger had a different amazing taste i had never been at a table where everyone passed their burgers around so everyone can taste it was not only fun but delicious everyone of them my husband ordered the roasted baby beet salad and it was to die for although we were all stuffed we opted to go for the dessert and share it the seasonal warm bread pudding we were stuffed but could not put our forks down i recommend this to all local and visitors it s worth the drive out
  neighborhood establishment been going there for past 4 years food is excellent as is the service have tried variety of items on menu never disappointed they have blue moon on tap and served with orange slice very happy
  first time i went here i ordered a long wong big mistake the long wong was a hotdog smothered in ez cheese and tasted like cancer so i avoided this place for awhile after later on i came back to try the wings and damn they were good well the suicide wings were only ones i got but for 12 they were cheap lw s didn t skimp on the dip and they had a good burn to them definitely worth the price if you don t feel like cooking and want to go out and get some cheap spicy wings
  the food is nice i found the portions to be rather small the salsa and chips were fresh and tasty the atmosphere is cute this is more of a bar with tables at least it seemed so the friday lunch i ate there the noise level was way to high for me a table next to ours complained but i did not notice any change
  inconsistent everything this location gives the original owners a horrible name the pitas are cold and hard the service is the worst i ve experienced and the floors and flatware are dirty totally overwhelmed by the number of staff who stand at the counter when you walk in of the 5 times we ve been in here they ve never greeted us the whole place has a bad vibe i hate to write a review like this but we gave this location several opportunities if they at least changed the way the front is set up to be more welcome and inviting it would certainly help majority of staff has little personality chandler scottsdale locations have not lost the greatness that so many long time lovers of the pita jungle have come to love
  went here on a weekend game day and got a seat right away for two ordered a flight of beer and a cheese plate cheese was decent and the beer was amazing i would go again my partner has been for drinks more than me and he s always enjoyed it very family oriented
  postino s is one of my all time favorite restaurants they have the yummiest bruschetta salads sandwiches etc if you are not a bruschetta person you need to try theirs my favorites ricotta and pistachios white bean and tomato brie apples and fig bacon buratta well they are all so good go on a monday or tuesday after 8pm for happy hour and you can choose any bottle of house wine and 4 bruschetta for 20 the best place for happy hour if you are going to go though make sure you are there by 7 30 or 8 at the latest or you won t get a table until after 9 because everyone knows about postino s happy hour and it is legendary on a side note the raspberry chicken salad is probably the yummiest salad i have ever eaten
  omg the food was phenomenal especially the cornmeal mush biscuits and gravy was awesome too
  i have been to dlux numerous times a few times for dinner and a few times for brunch and in both large parties and small similar to most madison restaurants they don t take reservations for small parties and that inevitably leads you to 1 hour waits on the weekends so if you re trying to go here on a weekend night it is best to go early or late to avoid the rush same goes for brunch this is a frustrating and pretty unanimous policy for all restaurants in madison so just be aware the atmosphere itself of dlux is very hip and modern they keep the lighting low at night with a centrally located bar that is the focal point of the room but during brunch the place lights up with so much natural light from the front wall of windows as for the food everything i have had on the dinner menu has been on point in terms of taste and quantity all of the sorta burgers have a lot of different pieces to them that pull together a wonderful taste in every bite i am huge fan of both falafel and black bean burgers so if you re a vegetarian these are great options that are chalk full of flavor i haven t had many of the burgers but there are certainly a lot of choices that come loaded with toppings so you really can t go wrong one thing that is slightly annoying is the way that the burgers and sorta burgers don t come with a side realistically just the burger itself isn t going to fill me up so you re probably going to end up getting a side too it would just be easier if dlux automatically factored those into the items on the menu but when you do decide to add on a side item the sweet potato fries and sriracha mayo are 100 the best choice the sweet potato fries are some of the best i have ever had and that is saying a lot because i get them as much as i can and the sriracha mayo adds so much flavor that you start to realize sweet potato fries should always come with this sauce on another note for dinner foods if you re feeling like going a little healthier and choosing a salad both the south by southwest and asian noodle salads have my stamp of approval they give you huge portions so you ll most likely be able to take some home with you and they too combine so many ingredients that the taste is fantastic and you ll probably end up eating it all my real reason for not giving it five stars is the fact that i wasn t that impressed with their brunch yes they do have bottomless mimosas something that isn t common in madison but their only options for food are breakfast sandwiches and potatoes if you re going for the mimosas then this is definitely a great place to go because you will most certainly get your money s worth but if you re looking for a delicious brunch place with lots of options like eggs benedict breakfast burritos or omelettes as i usually am dlux falls a bit short
  i enjoyed the larger king cut prime rib i have been here several times always to enjoy a good steak
  i never had fish tacos before and the idea of it sounded strange to me so i was a little weary to try them i tried the mango jalepeno mahi mahi taco and the original fish taco both were delicious i liked the mango taco a little more though it tasted light and healthy prices are fair rubio s is a mix of fast food and sit down you order at the counter and then a worker brings the food to your table kind of like chick fil a i like this because there s no tipping required the decor is fun it s a mexican beachy feel
  the name mad greek conjures up memories of roadies to socal and those many pit stops in baker to buy lottery tickets i only stopped at the baker location once to get a gyro and thought it to be pretty decent so when the mad greek opened on rainbow my wife she s a socal and i wanted to check it out the reviews are mixed i ordered a gyro burger which had to be one of the most insanely delicious burgers i ve ever had the gyro burger is a fat burger patty topped with a serious portion of gyro meat lettuce tomatoes and tzatziki sauce the bun cradled the burger nicely and the sandwich was drip down your arms juicy it was almost too big my wife ordered a gyro and was slightly less impressed with her meal than i was with mine the pita seemed to be slightly stale there was very little feta and not much tzatziki sauce she also ordered a caramel shake which was pretty decent but still a little underwhelming i would certainly go back to the mad greek for one of their burgers but if you re looking for a great gyro you need to go around the corner to yassou s they still have the best gyro in town
  this was my first time here i really wanted to like it the service was horribly slow ordered the soprano s pasta but was informed they were out ordered the filet mignon just before serving it i was informed they were out of baked potatoes but would substitute pasta i said ok but can i get alfredo sauce was told only if i pay the upcharge i declined the bread in the basket was stale i arrived here at 8 15pm as of 9 20 i still have not received my entree i will never eat here again
  first time coming here and took an hour to get a burger on a weekday and after the first bite i find a long black hair cooked into the burger meat
  loved this place modern decor for sure the food was excellent appetizers soup and red thai curry yum
  i had a really mixed experience here took the bf for dinner here before a show at heinz hall which was really great for the convenience they re so close to one another we would definitely go back for lunch get the truffle fries appetizer and martinis someday but never again for dinner the entrees were expensive and nothing to rave about and the service wasn t anything special the dinners took forever to come out i know it was a saturday night but we got there well over two hours early and were still worried about not getting to our show seats on time it was a nice atmosphere but one that we felt a little to young and poor for we re still college students i think i d try somewhere else for a nice date night next time but again i will definitely go back to splurge some lunchtime on the cake batter martini truffle fries and other desserts and appetizers
  we went to this place on a whim we ordered our food and sat down about 5 mins passed and the cook came out and had us try a salmon slider omg is all i have to say deffo coming back
  you know i have no idea why i eat crab legs in the first place the work necessary to attain the amount of usable sustenance just makes me cry but my wife actually enjoys using those miniature forks and digging the crab meat out of those things for me it s torture however this place has good service good food once you salvage it and is well lighted which is good considering you have to work with tools in order to eat the prices are reasonable as well my only complaint about this particular place was the incredibly loud music we were only one of four couples in there and i could not hear my wife who was just sitting across the table from me normally that s a good thing but there was no tv for me to watch as is the usual routine but here is where they lose the star we asked them if they could possibly turn down the music a little keep in mind that it was intensely loud and they said that they could not the waitress explained as to why not but i could not hear her explanation due to the loud music maybe it s just me but when i eat lunch in a restaurant not being able to converse at the table doesn t make a whole lot of sense
  this is a place like no other you can have breakfast lunch dinner and desert all in one location my favorite for desert is the avalon with hazelnuts instead of the candied walnuts we have been to this place several times a week and we have never had a crepe we did not like the staff is very friendly family like the mimosa s are awesome as well as the coffee this is a place we can go to every day and never get tired of it that is how good this place is there is a great menu to choose from no matter what your desires are or the time of day the decor inside is very warm and friendly a place you can take you laptop to and just hang out there are two big screen tv s on the wall and you can get lost for hours if you are not careful you will go in for lunch and end up staying for dinner and desert i cannot say enough about how great this place is and until you try this place you will never know but i promise you once you try it you will never go anywhere else for a crepe again they have perfected the crepe experience and the creations are so mouth watering you will eat the entire plate one last note one day i ordered the avalon and took half home to eat later when reheated it was just as good as when it came off the crepe maker all the flavors were still there and when i was done eating my left overs i was left wanting more i don t care when you stop by this place just make sure you stop by and try this place for yourself you will not be disappointed
  nice lively atmosphere great service and good food
  arrived at midnight on a thursday to have some martinis with my girlfriend bartenders were very nice however the bouncer short black guy was extremely rude music selection was really good and the drinks were decent it was 12 45 and they called out last call so we ordered a martini 15 minutes later the bouncer starts trying to kick us out he was super rude and said that if we don t chug our drinks he would take them away i did not appreciate his behavior due to the fact that you enjoy a martini not chug it i was planning to celebrate birthday here but i will be taking it elsewhere if you want people to drink in your establishment don t kick them out when they just ordered a drink
  i have eaten here many times over the years but forgot to write a review before now the service and food are always excellent my favorite dish is the pork with beans and rice and a wonderful au jus fresh lime slices that just go perfectly with it fresh iced tea with mango i always get a side order of the plantains too they give you wonderful island bread for no extra charge i used to live in the caribbean and know their food is authentic and very well done generous portions my only complaint is that they have gotten me completely hooked on mojitos i had my first one there and now i just can t stop craving them nice toe tapping cuban music not snooty fancy but very nice casual you feel like you re on a patio instead of in an enclosed room
  first time here great meal sat at the bar and jay was very helpful he made some great recommendations the tuna and baja volcano was excellent
  for your basic cheeseburger i have never been so satisfied this place sets the bar for your expectations i highly suggest you eat it at the location because there is something about that period fresh off the grill where the chilled condiments and dressing creates a moment of eye rolling pleasure with the out of this world patty and melty cheese the staff as always is fantastic
  great place to drink cheap beer but it gets way too crowded this place is a college bar that people of all ages go to the beer is cheap and the food is cheap also but surprisingly good for cheap bar food my only complaint is how crowded it can get to the point where you can t move but i guess that means it s a popular place they have an outdoor patio in the back
  the warm salsa is a delight to the pallette you defineately cant be a gringo though but what have you done with the charro beans they are now frank n beany what happened to the delish spicy jalepeno flavored charro beans the ribs are the bomb but dont be fancy n cut each riblet they dry out chef been going hear since opening dont screw up the original menu the music on the weekends is great put the beans back n dont cut the ribs n u get a 5
  omg this place was soooo good the seasonings of the hot and juicy flavor is great the crab and shrimp cooked in this seasoning is sooooo delicious corn and potatoes are so yummy if you order the shrimp you get soooo much for the price 10 i love the idea of all the plastic bags gloves tableclothes no utensils no plates its so fun oh and the spicy is definitely spicy its a couple miles off the strip but even being a tourist having to take a cab its well worth the extra 10 cab ride
  the customer service here almost tops the food frank is just a cool dude all around and will lay the details out for you if your a first timer i say go for the chicken torta with side beans and rice you can t go wrong with anything here though honestly
  amazing sushi called for take out and the service was excellent prices were exceptional for the quantity and quality of our food rolls were delicious and unique highly recommended
  brief overview this chipotle location is in a convenient shopping center and has a nice ambiance for a sit down or take out mexican grill food pros awesome menu selection i love their burrito bowls and sofritas options great food quality i love how the guacamole comes free with the vegetarian salad bowl reasonable price it costs me about 7 56 for a vegetarian salad bowl love the decor a very urban and raw feel that add to the experience of dining in offers non gmo food now yay less toxic chemicals in our food cons lunch time rush can cause a longer wait time as with anywhere i wish they had more options than tap water and soda offering alkaline water would be ideal menu ingredient list is not 100 organic i would like to see this guarantee to take their quality to the next level final verdict i ve been to this chipotle countless times and love the consistency of their food quality and fairly fast lines the food tastes great and is at a very reasonable price this location and the others i ve been to make chipotle one of my favorite fast food locations to eat at
  went there lastnight eating leftovers today alot of food best mexican in vegas though
  visited the draft house on 1 27 12 for their fish fry and am pleased to report that the fried lake perch and baked fish were both excellent i have a full review with pictures and details posted over at my own site check my profile for the link sorry to do that to you but i hate posting duplicate reviews info i ve also updated my running list of best and worst fish frys in wisconsin oh new hidden gem from dh spinach artichoke dip yummo
  it is close to impossible to find good bbq but after seeing the great reviews and mouthwatering pics of rollin smoke on yelp i had to come here while in vegas location is easy to get to small lot to park in having read how full it gets we went shortly after opening at 11 am to find no lines and only a few people dining by the time we left an hour later no tables left line out the door so plan accordingly they offer 10 off when you show the coupon on their website we went with a burger and waffle fries kids meal for my son and he enjoyed it great waffle fries i had the 2 slider combo with baked beans and enjoyed both the brisket and the pulled pork their sauces are amazing my favorite was the mama s sweet so tasty drowned the meats in there a soft hawaiian bun it was too tasty my husband had the 3 brisket sampler and only enjoyed the chopped one the sliced was very dry and the burnt ends just soggy fat so glad i passed on getting just an order of burnt ends my husband had the mac n cheese and said it was pretty artificial and the baked beans were also just ok in all fantastic bbq i ll be back for the pulled pork and chopped brisket and their best ever bbq sauces
  best buffet i ve had in vegas and i ve been to most of the major hotel buffets everything we ate would have been quite good as an entree or appetizer on its own and desserts were excellent they also had a nice selection of meats many of which were lean cuts like flank steak not just typical prime rib roast and ham the only thing underwhelming was the salads but you aren t there to eat lightly so this wasn t a big deal service was also quite attentive and kept our glasses full at around 38 person for dinner it s not cheap but most decent restaurants we were finding would have cost at least this much just for entrees and a first course let alone dessert and wine i will absolutely return to this buffet on my next visit to the sin
  i love the location right across the street from my gym lvac i love the almost guilt free menu options buffalo chicken wrap and rockin raspberry smoothie this trip i even love the deals they have at this location like buy 2 smoothies get one free from 4 7pm and their free junior all american wrap with purchase of a smoothie from 7 10am the two star rating is spawned from the seemingly intolerable drive thru wait time and service on this particular trip i decided to time my experience 36 minutes total from line entrance to smoothie acquisition on top of that i was charged for 3 smoothies initially despite being well within the buy 2 get 1 free time window as a minor aside they also neglected to ask what sort of side i wanted with my wrap i guess i sounded like a baked sour cream and onion chips kind of guy perhaps management needs to hire additional staff or streamline his production process the young man that waited on me seemed pretty stressed out
  this place is really nothing more than a cheesecake factory superimposed in swanky vegas hotel and of course in true cheesecake fashion the glossy voluminous menu book puts any children s storybook to shame and the offering always seems better on the menu than on the plate but then again when it s 3 30am you ve blown 600 for either an overpriced champagne at a club or at the blackjack table with impossible bets and you re dying for some post party munchies none of the above matters all you care about is the unlimited serving of warm bread with butter carb heavy dish big enough to feed a family of 4 in a third world country and a glass of ice cold coke to wash it down with budget friendly comfort food
  one of my all time favorite burger joints you can watch as they freshly make your burger in fries right in front of you if you want a burger that s full of flavor and not dripping with grease this place is it fries are great too i love when they put what farm the potatoes came from today they came from pasco wa
  literally one of the best meals i ve ever had didn t look as amazing from the outside but the second you walk in it is a great setting definitely do the tasting menu the halibut was the best halibut i ve ever had and the lobster soup was the best lobster dish i ve ever had i highly recommend this place
  good burgers even better grilled chicken burgers portion could be larger as i can easily finish two plus a salad and a malt shake pricier than most other burger joints but the taste is better too tables are usually clean but the seats are not always wiped down that s the quick 15 second elevator ride summary and now the verbose version p so groupon offered a burger promo a few months back to a few burger joints around vegas smashburger was one of the options and i selected the lake mead location because i have never been to this location before it is located in a popular strip mall plaza dolphin court day spa grape street starbuck dq walgreen and a red box and gets plenty of traffic but on a chilly thursday evening in november i did not have to wait at all to place my order nor have trouble finding a booth to sit down and enjoy the chocolate malt shake and grilled chicken avocado club plus a side order of smashwedge salad their grilled chickens are always nice and juicy and what you end up ordering will be up to your personal preference or your mood i went with the avocado club option and it was delicious the side of smashwedge salad was pretty good but you have to really love blue cheese and blue cheese dressing their milkshakes and malts are all very good today i went with the chocolate malt and it was as delicious as always only gripe about dining at smashburger is that the burgers and chicken sandwiches are not at all a big hearty sandwich and a growing teenager or someone with a healthy appetite can easily put away two of them which means taking out a family of four here can easily put a small dent in a parent s wallet service was good and my order was placed without any issues location sw near the 95 and summerlin parkway taste 4 5 i like the food i have had at smashburger overall except i am not a fan of their onion rings all their milkshakes and malts are excellent price 3 5 a tad pricier compared to their peers quality 5 5 everything appears to be made from fresh ingredients parking 3 5 in a busy plaza with plentiful parking spaces although not all of them are right outside the front of the restaurant
  the drive thru line is normally a bit long but the food is usually given on time a couple of my previous coworkers from another job work here so it s fun seeing them here the only thing i noticed is that the entrance is inconveniently located you can only access this restaurant by one street only
  i love this restaurant very good food and the vegetables are fresh and customer service is very good and also the people who work there are respectful and nice i love eating there
  food was okay but you can t eat mexican every week it s now closed not surprised hope it reopens as a sports bar with a varied menu
  found metropolis because i heard the fez owners were opening a new place nearer to my home the initial visit did not provide anything that stuck out substantially positively or negatively there were a few creative dishes that sparked my interest i ended up with a shrimp and lentil combo never had that combo before which was tasty wubby ya know since i m hubby had a pasta and meatball dish that she liked the meatball was the single tastiest item indoors was on the loud side especially at this part of the year i would recommend eating outdoors they do offer a kids menu with seven choices which i found a bit out of sorts metropolis is more to bring someone to impress for a first date than a child metropolis was good enough for a return visit
  clean restaurant friendly staff good food this place was great
  this subway has a drive thru which i thought awesome until i opened up my sandwich at work it was smashed poorly put together veggies everywhere soggy it was disgusting i had been on a subway streak for almost a week and this sandwich put that to a dead stop i couldn t eat subway for another month bottom line you have to watch the person physically make your sandwich because otherwise you get something completely inedible
  this is easily the best pizza i ve had in a long time not only is it a lot better than most other pizza chains it s a lot cheaper too also the staff is courteous and professional they had my pizza ready just a few minutes after placing my order i will definitely be going back soon and often
  i m usually a fan of all sierra gold pt locations they have great specials and although you are able to smoke there it s not a smokey place at all tonight we visited this place to finish off the birthday extranvaganza our server was rachel she was super sweet and made our experience tonight a good one it was awesome that she had our best interest in mind for instance i ordered a vodka soda with a lime she said that for 0 50 more you can get belvedere vodka instead of the well brand we also got the italian sausage pizza for 16 99 half off after midnight there was a lot sausage on the pizza and the crust was thin and crunchy always a fan topped with ranch and i ve got a great meal to end my birthday extranvaganza rachel bought our whole table washington apple shots every place i ve been this weekend has given me a nice birthday surprise and sierra gold was no different thanks for a wonderful end to my birthday extranvaganza
  cant say enough good things about sens excellent food and excellent service
  every time my partner and i visit vegas our vegas girlfriends take us out to dine at local culinary gems elements kitchen and martini bar is one of those places the hospitality we received is the kind that keeps me coming back for more the martini list is long and awesome i wanted to try all of them but my favorite that night was a banana flavored one delicious yes i had two adult candy our entrees were delectable dessert was over the top we got to sample pretty much everything on the dessert menu it was such a nice evening i can t wait to get back to vegas and return to elements
  we went to the yard a few sundays ago to enjoy a nice afternoon brunch with fellow yelper and friend laura m we met right around noon as laura pointed out our desire to have some adult bevvy s at a reasonable price and a lot of them on top of that helped sway our decision to make our first brunch meeting at the yard my first impressions of the place was awkward it s located in a basement no real actual natural light except from the entrance the you can see from the bar we sat in the dining area off the bar now since it was a basement the room echoed everyone s voice so it was also on the loud side so our conversation was projected and certainly kept getting louder as the drinks kept coming matt and i both ordered the chorizo scramble spicy chorizo crumbled eggs fresh pico de gallo cilantro sour cream served over home fries i had the unlimited bloody mary bar and he had the bottomless mimosa my meal looked appetizing but it was pretty dry i found myself dumping ketchup on it to give it some moisture and i am no fan of the red stuff i took more home than i ate and tried mixing into an omelet but it wasn t that good either so i ended up pitching it the service was really good our server was attentive unfortunately our table was really wobbly so wobbly we nearly spilled our drinks a few times we tried to fix the problem the most classiest way possible by shoving sugar packets and napkins under the leg but it didn t help another employee came over to assist but noted it was actually the table top not the base that was the issue so we just had to endure it our brunch seriously turned into a 6 hour marathon after laura left we eventually made our way out to the bar to switch it up and have a few beers and watch some football the bar was pretty cool and one of the servers took our picture since it was our one year wedding anniversary funny though i think i look a little tipsy in that picture i did have about 6 bloody mary s and a few beers but i wasn t driving so who s counting the yard is more of a 3 5 since the bar and staff were great and my company was awesome but my food left something to be desired i think in the future i would try one of their sandwiches or burgers maybe one of those colossal grilled cheese i saw a couple come out and they looked very tempting
  went here today for a work christmas party our hr plans everything and last year it was a success but this year not so much due to the poor communication of the staff prior to arriving to the restaurant the company had already emailed the chef what our orders were to be but there was some confusion and two waiters came by to ask orders and write down what each person was going to eat our appetizers came out fast and the setting was nice and that s where the two stars came from when our food came out that s when everything was messed up they all of a sudden ran out of prime rib which we ordered 20 orders of then they forgot 6 of us so 6 people were sitting without food while everyone else ate for at least 30 minutes after everyone else received food once most of everyone was served the waiters neglected to check on us to see if everyone was served they left 1 person out and that person waited 1 hour to eat after everyone else was almost already finished the staff was not accommodating at all either as we had kept asking what other choices do we have if you ran out of the food we has pre ordered they said we had no choice but to stick with their chicken alfredo pasta which was mediocre it was not a very good first experience coming to this restaurant and i m not sure i would willingly come here on my own or tell friends about this place
  spending more then 2 days in vegas sure does fck up your schedule breakfasts are actually lunches naps during the hottest part of the day 2pm 5 are usually the norm recovering from the power nap you find yourself having dinner rather late friends and i found ourselves wrestling between bellagio buffet or mirage buffet for dinner by the time we had made our minds and sauntered across the street from our hotel watched a round of dancing water to frank sinatra we arrived at the buffet at the tail end of dinner service something tells me the food would have been better if we were maybe an hour or two earlier not that it was bad it s just some of it tasted like it had been out there for awhile it was nothing to write home about nothing near the 5 stars the staff looked a bit drained we wanted to order coffee at the end of dinner but decided against it as i was frightened the reaction we d get from the staff who had already begun to fold napkins for tomorrow s breakfast service i only ate the sushi because i have balls and a stomach of steel eat at your own risk
  i went to society late in the evening on it s first day open technically going on on the second day but they are open very late so that is that first off hilarious is the review of hard to please i saw the review the first day that i went to write this and it slightly annoyed me that someone would rather complain about toast that is over done rather than ask for new toast not that big a deal then lol to post a photo of the toast scrapings classic seriously i waited to read other reviews as i was in a hurry to get some late night action in anyway i had a great time 4 stars instead of 5 because it was the first day the server was trying hard to please us as she was swamped and the cute busser from france ended up helping us out more throughout the meal even taking an order when needed to me this says a bit more about the service again the minus 1 star because they had kinks to work out and i am sure they will it s a new joint but i will definitely go again food was quality i had short ribs hard to mess up and the warmed pretzel bread with grain mustard butter was a nice touch while we waited for food the price is about 50 per guest that was with 1appetizer 1 cocktail each and 1 entree each no dessert we were too full portion sizes are great and the setting is modern and comfortable anyway if you are encore and need a late night meal check it out on a side note switch steakhouse looks awesome and if you can t join them in the dining room sit at the bar just outside and watch the scene and color of the dining room change every so often then go eat there happy eating
  look it upsets me that you have to give even one star i can read the other reviews and i have been here more than a few times but tonight it was just beyond a bad dinner yes we were the table of 7 people at about 8pm yes we were group at the high top tables that were pushed together you would have to remember us because we were the table that had 1 2 of a waiter it was so nice of you to take the time to take our order and then let the waiter go home because he had been there since lunch you know what sucks more than working 2 shifts how about being the last table for the guy who worked 2 shifts it was so nice of the manager to let him leave but hey how about taking the time to have someone finish the open orders simply the food was not good and you are over priced but the worst part is that your staff is just not good at their job they dont care and that is a result of management not caring
  come here often however lately the food hasn t been what it use too the desserts i could have come across at a cheap 8 off strip buffet crab was hit or miss shrimp under boiled and nothing looked as fresh as it once was i saddened to say i may not be back
  i like their curry but the restaurant is quite small i always liked curry house in california i think this place curry zen is now my curry spot in las vegas i m happy i don t have to go to california to taste decent japanese curry
  we went there and sat on the deck for 15 minutes and nobody came out there were 2 other tables already eating and nobody came out i called them on the phone and asked if anybody was working the deck and she said she would be right out waited another 10 minutes and nothing we got up and left and will never go back we were pretty regular customers but this place has gone hill fast will not go back despite the great beer selection service sucks big time
  a good value for money at half off
  dude i have not eaten at a wendy s restaurant in years i m serious i think the last time i ate at wendy s i was drunk it was 1am and we were in that special state of inebriation when even gas station hot dogs taste like the best thing in the world so i can t say i even remember the last time i actually ate wendy s and had an opinion about it yesterday i was between home visits and it was 3pm and i had yet to eat anything for the day so i pull through and order a 1 single patty burger with two slices of cheese onion tomato lettuce pickle mustard ketchup a small fry and a soda still not sure if it had to do with me starving or if it really was just that good but that was one of the best burgers and fries i have ever eaten my new fast food fix
  omg this place is amazing the bacon blue pancakes and apple pancakes were so yummy service was great and the folks really cared about us definitely highly recommend this place
  300 for two with a 54 bottle of barbera this place leaves a lot to be desired antipasti was excellent trotter and grilled squid primi shared clams and linguini pasta was not even close to al dente as you could break it offered a tagliatelle as alternate over seasoned to the point of almost inedibility but didn t want to send back secondi of veal shank and braised short ribs you have to be kidding batali likes to season his food i think he needs to have a chat with his cooks it was so salty as to make it just a shame service was excellent kevin our server handled our input well but don t waste your money
  love the pizza awesome service perfect sports bar
  great breakfast spot literally in my neighborhood french toast is my favorite hubby and i walk over and if we do drive the owners brother has a car detailing service in the parking lots all around its great food fast service and close to home
  went there yesterday afternoon first off the waiter was not aware of the happy hour specials next we decided to get a drink that we were told was a happy hour drink only for it to take 15 mins for our drink because the bartender didn t know how to make that drink he was going through a book and looking on a coworkers phone for a good 10 mins to figure out what was in the drink we get our food and my mash potatoes were cold in ask another waitress for some hot ones and she caught a little attitude and brought me some hot ones next i go to eat my pasta and it was very dry i asked not one but two ppl for extra sauce and the same lady had an attitude yet again she was the heavy heavy set waitress btw my waiter brought out the extra sauce but it was 10 mins later by the time my sauce came my food was cold and i didn t want to eat it when we received our check the waiter who told us our drinks were happy hour drinks turned out to not know they were not and priced us regular when we mentioned it instead of talking to us he quickly got the manager he couldn t stand the heat the manager acted like he was doing us a favor and told us he wasn t supposed to but he gave us a discount when it was his waiter who screwed up after that we wanted the check split in two and butchered that also smh everyone working there seemed like they were new and didn t know a thing this was my 3rd time at this applebee s and the third time with horrible service 3 strikes you re out never again i ll make the extra 15 min drive for good service oh one more thing i ve been 21 for literally 4 months and look young same with my friend who s been 21 for two months the waiter never even carded us
  one of the best indian restaurants in the valley jonathan is right really good category we have had dinner there several times lamb saag chicken vindaloo and chicken tika masala are out favorites we like it 8 and hot garlic nann actually has garlic on it unlike so many other indian restaurants great service we will be back
  i ve been to other ihop locations but this one seems to be sub par we were seated quickly and the waitress was ready to take our order immediately our waitress was super awkward and the service was poor she must have asked us what we would like to order about 3 times in two minutes are we not allowed to look over the menu i ordered the strawberry banana french toast because it looked and sounded amazing on the menu i was severely underwhelmed if sugary syrupy half frozen strawberries on thinly sliced bread is your thing you might love it when checking out they were trying to tell me i needed an id to use my visa debit card they hassled me for about 10 minutes over a 10 purchase it wouldn t have been a big deal but my id was at home visa strictly prohibits merchants to require and id with a signed debit card so i didnt bring it get it together ihop i gave two stars for cleanliness but i won t return
  you will find the world s largest chocolate fountain here it s certified by guiness world records so don t even think you ve seen one larger than this it s actually a very amazing thing to see and it draws quite a crowd during the day they serve some fantastic candy here have some amazing looking cakes and pastries and ice cream i ve only tried some various candy and it s all been outstanding hope to try some of the pastries here the next time i m in vegas
  everyone in this town including me has become a self proclaimed pizza critic humble pie pizza bianco cibo and the parlor are eveolving phoenix into a serious pizza city those who enjoy brick oven pizza this is a must and those who just eat delivery pizza must come to grips that pizza hut s hq is not in italy food the heart of the house is right in the dinning area a wood fire brick oven and ladies were talking real wood here they make the pizzas right in front of you how fun see quick note they do a great job with non pizza items and a fun kids menu service this is a pizza joint right rule number one for amateurs don t get antsy pansy because things take time on the weekends this place gets crowded why well probably because humble pie has created a popular brand i like personal service most the time your server takes care of you from start to finish and i like that i think restaurants like humble pie have given new life to the 7th st phoenix restaurant district im glad to see the 85006 zip code continuously attracting more restaurant owners the phoenix area is building up and keeping growing businesses a shot at success happy pizza kevin u
  went with my colleagues 8 people around 5pm and was seated right away it took some time for the chef to show up but we didn t mind since we had our drinks and the free sake after checking in yelp i had the new york steak hibachi which was ok service was great but their sake menu was very limited bottom line great service inexpensive average food and limited sake options
  i ve been in love with maggiano s since before it came to phoenix i grew up going to the locations in chicago and am happy to say that the food quality and service is spot on in scottsdale too here are a few tips to dining at maggiano s that will enhance the experience 1 make a reservation they take them for all party sizes 2 go with 4 or more people and dine family style there are tons of menu options the cost is reasonable and its bottomless as long as the plate is clear 3 wear expandable clothes you will over eat some of my favorite vegetarian dishes include the maggiano s salad no prosciutto mushroom ravioli gnocchi in vodka sauce and cheese ravioli in a creamy pesto sauce i know none of this is healthy but every once in a while you need to let loose and enjoy fantastic italian food
  i d say my experience at this flower child was equally as good as my experience at the other location the interior looks pretty much the same from what i remember but it s been nearly a year since i tried the other one the people working there were super nice giving us samples of raspberry ginger kombucha and cucumber mint lemonade the kombucha was kind of odd in taste but the lemonade was so tasty also they were giving out free flowers stickers and headbands which was pretty sweet sometimes when a place first opens everything moves a bit slow for a while but everyone working there seemed to know what they were doing there was a line out the door when i first got there and it moved pretty fast i also noticed there were some differences on the menu they did not have the delicious lentils i got last time but seemed to have some new stuff i ordered 3 sides the sweet potato with bok choy the gluten free mac and cheese and the watermelon heirloom tomato salad portion was small for 9 but everything was delicious the mac and cheese was a tad too rich though but very tasty my sister got a mushroom pho and she liked it but i didn t like it very much i also got a bittersweet brownie for dessert and it was delicious so excited that this location is only like 10 minutes away from me since the other one was so far i will definitely be back
  consistently the best burger you will find in phoenix my wife ordered the chicken sandwich and that was cooked to perfection fries were hot crispy and not over seasoned many burger choices here in town but the zinburger is the most straightforward and delicious all the ingredients are a perfect blend caramelized onion really adds flavor important note the bun is both flavorful and equally important holds up under the strain service throughout the place at the tables is attentive and friendly but this time we sat at the bar and enjoyed that too we have many place we can go we choose to go to zinburger
  first know that i was born and raised in new orleans and know better than to expect much from remote places claiming to prepare authentic creole food being in the desert of arizona business trip i was predicting the gumbo to be tomato soup with hot dogs floating in it the place didn t look like much from the outside or the inside but being a brave and noble soul i charged ahead and ordered the fried green tomatoes fried pickles a cup of gumbo and a shrimp po boy i can t believe how good it was they might make the best fried pickles i ve ever had the gumbo was delicious well everything was delicious but be warned i ate too much and almost fell asleep at the table great food
  i was invited to come back to weera to give them a second try this time i brought a friend who also has a taste for thai food we ordered the panang with chicken the larb pei larb with duck tom kha khi and retried the duck curry i am very pleased to say that weera has definitely made some changes and for the better i would give them about a 3 5 and possibly will give them a 4 later on the panang was slightly sweet but not too much for most people if you dislike sweet panang you may want to order it without added sugar the flavor was interesting and a little bit unique although it isn t the best i have had i enjoyed it the chicken was nicely prepared and tender the larb pei was a dish i haven t had before it is basically a larb with a lightly sauced duck my friend said that it was too gamy tasting for him but he also said it was just one particular piece of the meat that was like that i enjoyed it but i am a duck lover when it comes to thai food to me it had a light taste i enjoyed it by lightly covering my steamed rice with it i also put a little panang on it and it seemed to pair pretty well the tom kha khi wasn t my favorite but it was a little unique compared to other places around town they put lightly flavored white onions tomato pieces plus the usual galanga lots of lemon grass etc the chicken was nicely prepared as well it had lots and lots of fillers in the soup i asked for it extra sour which turned out nice it was very spicy my only complaint and i explained this to the new owner was that it wasn t creamy enough for my taste the duck curry i am happy to say was much better than before they said that they took my previous review to heart and decided to start preparing their curries the way they do it in thailand meaning that instead of asking people what heat level they want light spice ruins curry they make the curry spicy enough to make the dish tasty and ask customers to add chili on their own i added chili and this really made the curry taste great while this isn t the best curry in town it was enjoyable i will definitely be returning to weera and i look forward to trying other dishes here if i stay happy this could easily turn into a 4 star review
  i went here sunday night with a party of 4 this was my first authentic like tapas experience so excuse my ignorance because i really don t know much about spanish tapas the ambiance of the place is great they must have spent tons of cash making this place look like an establishment right out of spain the waiters all were dressed in all white with red sash thingys and red hats they looked like spanish bull fighters to me anyway the decor is very interesting to say the least i had initially thought the place had just opened because some things were a complete clusterfuc like the staff was still working out opening day problems from getting menus to getting bread and beverages it was a bit rough however the entire staff was very friendly and the food did come out rather quickly in total we tried about 7 tapas they have tons to choose from and they looked rather authentic to my gringo eyes most of the stuff i ve never heard of but they pretty much all looked great most are around 7 and are probably enough for a few people to sample almost everything i tried was very good and the stuff that wasn t was because i had no idea what i was ordering and was trying to be adventurous all in all it was a fun experience and a perfect thing to do when having dinner with friends i regret not getting the sangria after reading the reviews on here but there is always next time
  the sushi here is pretty mediocre its an all you can eat sushi place for newcomers of sushi and aren t too picky they have a pretty good selection and the bonus is that they have mango in some of their choices however the mango is sour and crunchy not the asian kind the service is pretty bad and they don t speak very much english so coming here with a chinese speaker would be your best bet if you re looking for all you can eat sushi in waterloo you re better off going to sushi 99
  i thought i had written a review about this place already but i missed it i was a fan of it when it was in independence a not so nice area it moved to pineville and i still think its worth the trip specially because the ceviche here is the best you will find in charlotte i do not like genaro s cevhice i feel like they are tricking people on believing thats the actual ceviche and its not go to machupicchu and you will taste the closest to our real ceviche i love most of the dishes in machu picchu my favorite are the pan de yucca yums and the sauces ceviche and chaufa de mariscos i just wish they would open another restaurant close to uptown charlotte with this much variety of options
  this past saturday my family went to the palm for my dad s birthday is it worth the price for me no two steaks two prime ribs two sides a dozen oysters three cocktails and one bottle of wine equal a 454 check not including tip but the food was excellent my mom s prime rib was about as big as her face and the best she s ever had the wait staff were all friendly and professional this was actually my second trip to the palm the first was two years ago also for my dad s birthday my dad really loves the palm on that occasion the food was excellent but the waiter was not very good we actually had to ask for steak knives when a neighbor later asked my mom how dinner went my mom explained about the poor service the neighbor told her daughter who at the time was a server at the restaurant who told her manager a couple days later my mom received a phone call from the manager apologizing for the service and was sent a 150 gift certificate that kind of consideration for the customer as well as the food is what keeps my parents coming back the the palm and me as well as long as i m not picking up the check
  amazing i live in napa ca so my standards are pretty high and this restaurant met them in spades we went on a sunday for lunch when they had football specials which was nice our two sushi rolls were amazing and they were half price the clam chowder competes with some of the best i ve had elsewhere same goes for the mussles in the delish broth i would recommend springing the extra 5 for the extra garlic bread to get every ounce of the broth beers were a hot 2 bucks which was definitely a plus for our lunch definitely make this one of your vegas stops
  my husband and i love going to burger bar there is always a wait but that s just because it s really good on my most recent visit i tried the buffalo burger on a whole wheat bun and it was delicious i ve had the kobe and the black angus burgers as well and they are fabulous too the skinny fries are always amazing my husband always orders the beer sampler they have a great selection on tap and the sampler offers generous portions of any beers you wish to try my recommendation is that you get there a little early you ll probably have a 30 minute wait at about 6 on a saturday but if you get there later you ll be waiting a while oh and bring a hearty appetite
  the cook sends out little snacks sometimes the last time i was there he sent out goat cheese and whatever he used with it made goat cheese taste good yum although the caesar salad could have been more flavorful the steak scallops and veggies were really good wine was great and so was the service
  i had a terrible experience at this restaurant i frequent this restaurant a lot and this is the first time that i have ever been asked to leave because the waitress wanted to have more tips from the next patrons to be seated we had breakfast cashed out the first check with 20 tip then preceded to order mimosas on another check as we sat and talked the waitress then approached the table and asked us to vacate because we were affecting her tips we had spent 65 in 2 hours and tipped 20 which equalled 13 00 in tips alone we asked for the manager and asked him if there was a time limit on each table where he said no we then asked why his waitress felt empowered to ask us to leave just so you know we will now eat at the other breakfast spots in the area not this one just terrible
  it should really be a 3 and 1 2 star review but the 1 2 extra star is for the excellent customer service the reason for this was the burger i ordered was a little too charred i am not very fussy but it actually tasted charred my friend ordered a chicken wrap which was very good till he got to the second half and found that it was charred too way too charred for him to eat thus he had to send it back the saving grace of all this was that our server was really nice and did an excellent job from start to finish she kept refilling our tea brought the orders out swiftly and kept coming back to check on us i noticed that the other servers were also doing that too for the other clients thus they all deserve an extra star for it i think that because we had gone in right when they had just opened for lunch the cook was probably multi tasking while cooking our food a couple minutes too long and u get burnt burgers and wraps otherwise no complaints on the level of service food presentation and taste or variety we will be back and hopefully next time they will not burn their patties and meat again seems that is the only thing keeping them from another star for a lot of reviewers here
  i love this place my family and i have been coming to big heng for chinese food since we moved to arizona 14 years ago they have fast and friendly service and it is one of the best places for authentic chinese food although i don t come as often as i used too this is the only place we come for chinese
  one of my favourite places in the waterloo region fresh ingredients always consistent and a taste that keeps bringing me back highly recommended
  gotta say i think the yelp rating is a bit low 3 5 4 is more appropriate you can t deduct points for the schtick because you know it s there before you go so on to the food how many patties with or without bacon and fries is your choice keeps it simple beers are 24 oz and cold food arrives quickly and service is attentive many video screens with mostly 90 s music videos to watch while waiting burgers are quite good no complaint except possibly too much cheese fries are nice but expected a bit more flavor from the lard milkshake is very tasty yet pure fat between the 2 of us we ate about 20 of the shake prices were reasonable and we were pretty happy about the whole experience would return next time to vegas
  the waitstaff was incredible our waitress lisa had a sweet and positive energy that made our experience truly phenomenal the food was also amazing i definitely recommend the bread in the pot and the steak and chilaquiles great coffee too this place is a breakfast gem
  cashier and server were nice food was prompt don t get the tune melt it was bland and very dissatisfying something i could have made better myself the atmosphere was cold and unwelcoming it seems popular and the prices are good but i d rather spend my elsewhere
  i ve been here about 4 times and each time i ve had to pull over to wait but have placed large orders last night we went to grab dinner for my daughter s family and my husband daughter and myself we ordered the 16 piece meal and the young employee at the window was very friendly we only waited about 4 minutes in the parking stall before he ran out with our bag i asked about honey and he said he would go and grab some but my daughter said she had some at home he was probably in high school but super nice friendly by the time we got back to my daughter s house about 12 minutes away the chicken and biscuits were still very hot and i could tell that the chicken had been freshly made everything was great fed 7 people for about 34
  didn t buy anything from the actual supermarket but they had a great selection of korean ingredients the vegetables were very old however most of them were wilted or covered in fruit flies though the daily necessities ie green onions were still fresh the supermarket is super convenient and tasty the ban chans were just enough and the noodles soups that i ordered tasted very homey and warming the price was right as well if i ever moved to las vegas this is where i would get all my korean grocery needs
  tried the salmon wrap and julia tried the caprese panini the food was excellent great flavors nice presentation and it came with a refreshing side salad i will be back the downside is the ambiance very plain inside not much to look at boring music the server lacked enthusiasm about the food i think they should be more excited about they are producing
  went on a thursday at lunch place was busy and it s not that big service started out a little slow but our waiter fixed that by the end of the meal the chili con fritos was a good start all the burgers were good and the hot dog my daughter got was the best hot dog my wife had ever tasted overall a good place to go and get adventurous with your burger
  went here with my mom after ka show we asked to be seated in the tables right when you come in best spot to people watch and in vegas that s never boring i have to say we were very pleasantly surprised as to how good the food was the blue cheese potato chips were out of this world 13 i think then we both had a glass of reasonably priced malbec and lasagna 20 or so for both which is delicious made with bechamel as my mom does we didn t want to spend more at l atelier and didn t want to do the ghetto buffet so this was a great and tasty option with free show people watch it s amazing how people go dressed in vegas lol portions were very good as was the service for sure will be back especially for the blue cheese potato chips
  why did no one listen to me in my last review of peter s yard i specifically said do not bring me back here i will eat all the cakes and so far on my few return visits i am doing that with gusto peter s yard for me without a doubt bake some of the best cakes and bread in edinburgh the cake counter and buns and traybakes and muffins and slices i dare anyone with a sweet tooth not to walk by these and immediately pupils dilating shout out uncontrollably that one to the poor waiting staff behind the counter my reaction wasn t that extreme but oh boy it s close i ve stopped by here a few times for just a coffee and to be honest despite that the coffee is good i wouldn t say it s the best place to come for just a coffee as it s always really busy crowded and there are only 4 comfy seats the rest are all hard wooden with small space if you know that what it s going to be like then no problem but it s just not very comfy maybe the place to read the morning paper rather than nestle in with a good book it s not a criticism just sayin but i will suffer uncomfortable seats for their cakes on my first cake outing i had two yes two not at once paced a good hour between which is ok right the fruit bun one of the three buns that are regularly available the others being cinammon and cardamon was simply delicious blueberries on top custard inside then the coffee and sour cream loaf that followed was perfect the parsnip cake i tried was also brilliant huge grated chunks of parsnip and a very generous slice they also have a wee box of little coffee side biscuits for those wanting a sweet treat but perhaps not risking the guilt after the chocolate and cardamon biscotti type one i tried was a lot denser than it appeared and perfect oh and the scones they are massive as big as my face the fruit one i got to go and had at home later with soup was divine apple and blueberry with a giant slice of apple on top the word rustic springs to mind the thing i like most about all these cakes all the ones i ve tried is they re not overly sweet they are still very decadent probably loaded with butter and by no means am i kidding myself they re healthy but they tasted far less sweet than any supermarket store bought or chain coffee store cake the coffee and sour cream one was hardly sweet at all and whilst the orange icing on the parsnip cake was sugary the cake itself was again pleasantly mild this allows the other flavours of the cinnamon cardamon fruit and all sorts to come through the sponges are also entirely fresh oh i just can t really describe how much i love the cakes here my note on the lack of sweetness here is a good thing yes they re still sweet cakes but they taste so much more natural whilst other places in edinburgh are my real sweet spot treat thinking of the manna house here where the cakes are french sweet and perfect for my sweet tooth craving i almost feel i could have scone or parsnip cake for lunch from peter s yard and it wouldn t be too bad i feel i ve waxed lyrical enough about the cakes here much like louise c and also my aforementioned plea do not let me come here ok never is unrealistic but at least too often i plan to work my way through them all i do but would like to keep the wardrobe i have too
  went on sunday to watch week 1 of the 09 nfl season and was pleasantly surprised i used a coupon from www restaurant com and saved 10 off my 25 check bevs not included the food was good to excellent wings were fantastic big and meaty with great sauce and were only about 6 and change for a dozen the nachos were a giant pile of goodies and could barely get through half of it i didn t have any alcohol as i had my 3 yr old with me but i did feel totally comfortable with him there great family atmosphere even though it was croweded everyone was good little boys and girls and very friendly crowd there are plenty of tvs surrounding both dining rooms and there are plenty of teams represented it s not one of those bars devoted to just one team again friendly banter between different teams followers no yelling screaming fighting or even arguing heck i m a ravens fan and even chatted it up with gasp a pittsburgh fan what s next dogs and cats sleeping together good service lots of waitresses flying around and everyone seemed to be having a blast cheering on their teams
  we had the prix fixe menu that was complimentary for my friends bday this is some really americanized chinese food which is fine if it tasted good but extures and flavors were not good at all the sake was was pretty cheap compared to the prices of the food maybe the a la carte items are better who knows service was good very attentive the place looks nice but kind of too sterile not much character or charm it was dead when we were there for dinner and too quiet i won t be back to this joint
  great food chopped salad is filled filet mignon black spaghetti is full of great seafood and the butterfish is fantastic bartenders can be hit or miss small plates sides are also hit or miss brussel sprouts were not good
  best indian restaurant in montreal never disappointed in the food and always excellent and friendly service
  need more bartenders paid 20 for a cover charge but got horrible service on st patrick s day yes i am aware of the day but i expected better service i have gone here pervious days and service always sucks
  zoe s is good joanna w hit the nail on the head perfectly i ve had the gruben and its really good as is the coleslaw with feta in it i ve been there 3 times so far and each time i ve gone there it was because it was close and it wasn t mcdonald s i love mcdonald s don t get me wrong while the food is good it is definitely not a destination spot for me i wish they had some home baked chips instead of lay s or sun chips zoes is supposed to be healthy and i would say its not unhealthy but i wouldn t call this health food it would be great if it was healthy and earth friendly like stop using styrofoam throw in a few cfl bulbs here and there get rid of the honda elements and trade them for the honda insight imma just sayin
  without a doubt rotato offer a good baked potato cooked on a rotisserie until the skin is crisp while the inside remains soft and fluffy it almost doesn t need any filling however fillings are offered and if i am honest they are a little generic essentially predefined combos of standard sandwich potato fair and it is a little pricy compared to other baked potato offerings in a student focussed area still as long as they keep cooking the potatoes as well as they do i will keep coming back for a decent filing hot lunch
  i ve been to many mongolian bbq places all over the country but this was not mongolian bbq it tasted like a poor excuse for a fajita none of the sauces had the right flavor and even the suggested combinations were terrible i do not recommend this place to anyone especially if you have ever had real mongolian bbq it was a real disappointment
  me and my wife had a very nice dinner price not to bad i would come again service fast and good wish all a good experience too
  stopped by at bd s with a group of high school kids on a dinner while we went shopping at the southside mall i am a philadelphian at heart so the burg is pretty new to me the general atmosphere of the restaurant is good waiters are efficient and speedy we all picked the bowl option where you pick meats vegetables pasta tofu and various sauces spices to be pan seared fried into a dish this option costed 13 50 but i think bowl refills were rather inexpensive pros there were a huge variety of things to put in your plate including various types of strip steak seafood scallops and stuff chicken and marinated meats there were also many vegetables and tons of unique sauces including peanut soy sauce asian chinese black bean etc the chefs do tricks with the cooking tools while they are preparing your dish which is cool cons the bowls are rather small and the portions were not very good for the initial price but if you are extremely hungry the bowl refills are cheap some meat was not cooked fully as i wanted but still edible some meat was greasy but the entire dish was actually quite good it s fun to try different sauces and spices so all in all yes i would go here again just to try different combos and such but the small portions and steep initial price were the two biggest drawbacks it s definitely cheaper than the cheesecake factory nearby so grabbing some quick lunch or dinner is the best option
  warning danger bring a fire extinguisher can you say freaking hot i am all for a little spice in my food but holy geezus ok for those of you that like hot hot hot i mean burn your face off then later your butt you might enjoy this plethora of torture me not so much my dumb ass sister drug me and 4 other family members that were visiting from illinois to this fire pit of hell we ordered 2 pitchers of margarita s that were more like dinking lemonade yuck and they were way over priced 30 00 each kick ass pitcher my ass i asked our server how hot is the green chili his response to me was it s mild i then proceeded to order the machaca chimichanga with green chili sauce i love a good machaca chimi we waited for our meal sipping the lemonade aka margarita munching very salty chips mine without salsa because one bite of that left the tip of my tongue stinging the food arrived it was a huge portion i thought there is a go box in my future i took the first bite more dough than anything as usual with a chimi the second bite brought my temperature up about 10 degrees i continued thinking i must have gotten a seed or chunk of pepper the third bite woohoo 3 alarm fire in my mouth after sucking back an entire glass of water and several tortilla chips i decided it was the green chile sauce on top and began pushing it off and away from my chimi i go in for the middle of the chimi where the machaca is and no sauce hells bells are you kidding me that bite was the hottest of them all like i had found the scotch bonnet surprise i surrender i cannot continue with the taste bud massacre i think i am scarred for life at this point my lips are burning i am sweating and i am devouring a bowl of chips trying to put out the inferno raging inside my mouth my poor cousins are experiencing the same type of hell all except for my cousin jenny who has no tolerance for heat and got the most expensive cheese crisp in phoenix 6 95 its cheese and a tortilla people i stopped the server and said there is no possible way i can eat this it is entirely too hot is there anything on the menu other than the cheese crisp that is not hot he brought me the menu i found a garlic shrimp dish and ok sounds good for 13 95 i got 5 very large shrimp covered in melted cheese they tasted like the following recipe place 5 large shrimp in a small casserole dish sprinkle with as little garlic powder as possible add a hand full of cheese then put in the microwave until cheese melts it was awful gag gag gag it had no flavor at all i could even taste cheese ok i will wrap this up as i now am rambling away i am not a spice whimp i love wasabi and lots of it but this kind of hot is not for the average person who likes hot i cannot tell you if the spicy dish was good because the heat ruined it for me and my family my sister is the only one who liked it i will not be back not worth the drive the time the money or the recovery
  the good reasonably clean and well lit the owner and hostess are very pleasant and attentive pricing is mediocre time waiting for food is acceptable the bad our waitress had the personality of a paper sack didn t ever ask me if i wanted another beverage no smile just deadpan food was overcooked and dry tandoori platter i shall try another indian restaurant before i would go back
  bombay sandwiches d and when you receive it it looks like a brick of gold the full montagu tuna melt and also the haiwaiian bbq sandwich is amazing if you get hungry during the day then this is the way to go grab a bite to eat here and then head down to the fat tuesday station and wash it all down with an alcoholic slush doesn t get better than that right when in rome do as the romans do and you can even get refills on your fat tuesdays at caesars palace
  awesome tacos i highly recommend the carne asada quesadillas are good too but there isn t much of a taste difference we also tried a burrito but it wasn t that impressive at all the beans were good but i probably wouldn t order them again indoor seating is very limited so avoid peak times if you are trying to sit inside parking is also a bit of a challenge at times overall this is a tasty little lunch spot you can t really go wrong with what you order my biggest complaint is the flies inside eat a taco in one hand and swat flies with the other
  delicious my wife and i waited almost 6 months before we decided to try this greek place i don t know why we waited so long but it still pains me to think of all those months i missed of spectacular greek food less than two miles away in blakeney growing up in the greek orthodox church being a foodie and spending our honeymoon in greece i am very picky about my greek food from the quality of the meats to the tzatziki sauce and pitas to the salads and the dressings my ultimate favorite dish they serve is the lamb gyro the meat is by far the best in town hot flavorful and with just the right amount of tzatziki and olive oil mmm my mouth is watering now do not overlook having fries with your gyro so many greek places have those fat undercooked unflavorful fries that i can t stand not here the greco fresh fries are hand cut served hot and if you want drizzled with lemon juice and topped with oregano that s right superb i like mine with tzatziki sauce for dipping my wife loves the peasant salad which i always have to help her finish if you re not familiar with a peasant salad it s just the good stuff no lettuce filler think fresh cucumbers green peppers onions if you want tomatoes olives lots of feta and of course their delicious house made dressing you can t go wrong with this salad this is the way salad should be why waste space with lettuce that has no taste one word of caution the homemade tzatziki sauce stays on the breath for a while if you eat as much as i do so come packing a few pieces of gum for after your meal especially if going back to work they also have cheerwine on tap which is the shizzle if you are a true born and raised north carolinian the customer service there is top notch probably the best in ballantyne and the owner always walks around if he has time and talks and jokes with his customers the one comment about the greek guy who was angry about the baklava being store bought obviously needs to have his greek cred checked maybe it didn t taste like your mommas but it is definitely not from any store not only are the desserts baked in house the owner s wife makes them which is why they sometimes don t have galaktoboureko doesn t get more small business greek than that with that being said go eat at greco fresh and enjoy maybe you ll see us there tonight as well
  horrendous service my mother and i traveled specifically to try out this restaurant it s sunday night barely half the restaurant seated we waited almost 6 minutes at the hostess stand before anyone greeted nor seated us then they seat my 85 y o mother and myself on super high chairs at the bar we waited another 10 minutes no acknowledgment no greeting no server on sight so we left walked out we ll never come back to that less than stellar establishment i wish there was a rating for negative stars as that s what this place deserves
  always one of my favorites can t go wrong with the chicken madeira my favorite dish there the chili was great too one of the only places that no matter how full i am it is a must to get dessert
  i never thought i would love a chain so much but i do the server we had was fantastic i don t know her name but she suggested a margarita las vegas style and it blew my mind pt 1 of the food we got the recommend on the menu meatloaf with mashed potatoes and mushrooms so good we also had the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno vinaigrette and cilantro very flavorful and fresh overall super happy and pleased from start to finish fun dining experience with great food doesn t get much better a message to the lady below why would you bring your kid into a restaurant where people are smoking on the patio and there s a huge but gorgeous bar separating the outside from the inside i looked at your other reviews you just like to complain and get free stuff from management i m onto you
  i had a great time being checked on by 4 different employees just sitting at the bar the bartender was friendly and helpful when deciding on what to order to eat his name was alex and made sure everything came out quickly and to perfection
  the best chinese food still around and good price
  we came here for dinner on our recent trip to las vegas and after much anticipation decided it was totally not worth it the staff was friendly but very clearly overwhelmed our waitress had just been triple sat with 3 new tables at once and took quite a while to even get to our table for our initial drink order we like to get a good sampling of menu items on a trip to a new restaurant so we ordered a few items from each section the appetizers were probably the best part of the meal and that s not saying much the arancini was served with a tasty aioli without which the dish would have been forgettable the pizza we ordered was overly salty burned in places and raw in others if you want good pizza in the cosmopolitan ask any of the staff about secret pizza down an unmarked and unassuming hallway between two other restaurants is a gem of a new york style pizzeria my grilled octopus was tough and rubbery clearly overcooked the worst and most unforgivable part of the meal was one of our pasta dishes the oxtail raviolini i bit into one of these flavorless pouches only to bite down on a large piece of bone this dangerous and costly flaw killed the meal so we paid our bill and left and no we did not take the leftovers with us if you want much better italian food for a not too much higher price i suggest scott conant s other restaurant in the cosmopolitan scarpetta good food portions and service combine with reasonable price when compared to other fine dining restaurants in the area on second thought i m downgrading this restaurant from 2 stars to 1 there really are much better places to spend your money and that bone fragment was unacceptable
  first time at ruth s chris and i was very impressed service was on point with stewart as head waiter as well as several staff members who ensured that dinner was running smoothly angela was the biggest stand out all of the food and drink was delicious especially the sweet potato casserole and cigars on the front patio sealed the deal all in all great experience will return again definitely for business as well as pleasure
  some of the best food in noda if you leave there without getting the mac cheese you are doing yourself a massive disservice pork tacos turf and turf and fried mushrooms are worth your time
  oh my new yorker parents were in heaven at our lunch yesterday they live an hour away and are already planning their next trip to katz s perfect bagels and amazing smoked salmon pickles and cole slaw come complimentary pickles tasted fresh made in house although two on our table looked like they came from the jar instead like others have mentioned the cole slaw is yummy but room temperature my parents didn t seem to mind my mom s famous statement when asked if a meal out met her standards is often it s fine but its not like new york that statement was not uttered yesterday food was fresh and delicious stand out was the borscht yeah really killer warm beet and cabbage soup with a little bit of beef all food was filling generous and reasonably priced our waitress was a little mia due to some high maintanence tables it didn t diminish our lunch enjoyment though
  went to caffe boa for the 1st time with a group of girlfriends it was a horrible experience drinks took between 10 20 minutes each time we ordered and the restaurant was not busy wine should not take that long to pour my ice tea was never refilled i ordered the filet special with sauce on the side medium well when my entree came it was smothered in the sauce i sent it back immediately and when my steak returned it was dry and cooked well done 3rd time it came back correct but at that point about 2 hours into the meal it s just not acceptable i would have expected for something to be reduced on my bill but it was not i would have expected the manager to possibly come and apologize never happened needless to say i will never go back and will not recommend to my friends
  nice posh spot in boca park the place is small and seating might get hard to find it s a nice place inside and their outside patio is lovely i had a chai tea latte and it was ok for me their cakes look delicious so i think they re definitely worth trying service is good but it is a bit packed with people doing work
  first time wife and i have had ayce at a sushi restaurant and it was quite a treat the fact their price is only 24 person makes it that much better overall the food was very good and well prepared not cheap slop as one would expect the service is super fast and plenty of wait staff around to help all the time it was fri night at 10pm and it was packed the sushi was fresh and clean tasting and the rice was not overstuffed which showed they were not trying to fill you up on rice very impressive we had a few exotic rolls with interesting sauces and each was unique and distinct the deep fried soft shell crab appetizer was surprisingly good for such an inexpensive restaurant the hamachi kama was the only dish that was literally ruined by over cooking it i have had the real thing large cuts off the head shoulder in japan and hong kong for years and the way it should be is barely cooked over an open flame which draws out all of the oil and makes the fish super moist and melts in your mouth this was dry and therefore almost tasteless compared to the real thing but the truly amazing standout at this restaurant is clearly the seafood salad we started out with one and devoured it in joy the dressing is very spicy so be careful but it was bursting with flavor what they do in my opinion is use the end cuttings from the sashimi plus 2 pieces of tempura shrimp for the ingredients amazing pieces of every kind of fish and scallops and all melted in your mouth even the odd cut pieces of salmon were smooth as silk when they asked for last orders we were pretty stuffed so decided on one more of the seafood salad one allowed for each diner but when it came out we were blown away it had twice as much fish as the first order it was absurd had to have at least 25 pieces of fish scallops we could not even finish it and had to waddle out the front door because of it here s the thing if you eat sushi in any form it is filled with rice the menu does not offer sashimi for this reason most would order it over sushi so as not to fill up well this dish is all sashimi and then some you can eat great fish and not get overly filled up to leave room for some of the great appetizers will be back next time we are in vegas
  i have patronized this location twice and both times the food simply did not meet or exceed my expectations i am not a fussy diner either i have to chalk it up to being a new location i will try again in a few months
  i m not going to beat around the bush this place isn t the best their sushi was ok but not nearly as good as ichiza s upstairs in this same place and the service seemed rather poor too which made the situation even worse i came here for a friend s birthday and it was a letdown i know other people have had better experiences that i did so i m going to have to give it a try later on just to see if it s gotten better i hope so
  was here for a reception on sat 11 apr the food ambiance service venue was fine they do have good tiramisu
  i cannot say enough good things about this restaurant the service is always great and the food here is killer my boyfriend has tried almost every skillet on the menu and he has yet to be disappointed i usually go with the blintzes but i ve also had the egg sandwich and the tuna melt and everything has been awesome
  delicious breakfest many healthy options quick and attentive service
  i only stopped in here for a little while with a few friends but from what i saw it s a pretty chill spot there was a lot of people there though it was the afternoon before new years eve still judging by other reviews it has a healthy population of people often the parking kinda sucks because if there is no room on the street you have to park in the back and walk around the building and up the street a bit but no biggie i will have to go again so i can judge the service and try the food which i hear is good we shall see
  amazing burger i had the swiss and mushrooms on pretzel buns perfect i liked the sweet potato tots but i would have liked even more if they were crispier i keep the 5 for the outstanding burger
  the service is quick and the food is delicious i recommend going in for the lunch special it s a steal their best pizza is definitely the goat cheese and sundried tomatoe salad of course is the strawberry and gorgonzola this is my go to
  really friendly staff clean restaurant tasty food i had beef tacos dorados and cheese enchilada plate tacos were super crunchy and light and the enchiladas were bomb i liked the beans but wasn t a fan of the rice will definitely be back
  i went here after watching bourdain s episode on vegas and i wasn t disappointed the golden fried garlic prawns in particular were incredible we went here at 1pm on a thursday and the place was packed with locals we had the nam prik ong the crispy rice rice salad the jackfruit vegetable curry golden fried prawns and the house special fried rice and another item that bourdain ate don t remember it now everythign was great i d recommend to not get the crispy rice salad to go because well it doesnt stay crispy
  great restaurant simple concept breakfast and lunch is great i had the tacos chicken apple and the brisket the coleslaw was good had a little spice to it too the mac an cheese was ok i thought it would have some spice to it but it was ok all the food i had was something i would love to have again event though there are many places to go i would love to go back
  overall good experience but could have been a hair better i ordered the 6 chicken tamale deluxe combo because of what other people have written the chicken green corn tamale is just as everyone said said a unique flavor that really satisfies if you can get one or two unique things out of a mexican restaurant then you ve done well and this was it a close second was the ground beef flour taco i usually don t spend much time ordering tacos at restaurants but this one had a shell that was hard enough to hold it s form but soft enough to bend a little when you took a bite the bottom of the shell mixed with the juices from the beef and created a texture that i d not had in a taco before delicious one disappointment was the shredded beef flauta nothing to write home about and without a knife i ended up stabbing it and taking bites off of it one other disappointment was the salsa and hot sauce but i chalk this up to personal preference so i don t really downgrade restaurants because of it the salsa had chunks of fresh veggies but the flavor wasn t to my liking and it had quite a bit of juice in it you ended up getting some veggies on top and then juice which ran off of the chip the hot sauce has an earthy flavor to it that just didn t do it for me but others seem to enjoy it so to each his own last point the rice and beans were excellent some places try to do too much or too little but el bravo found the perfect balance of spices and natural flavor really enjoyed it as for the extras the restaurant is easy to find and there is plenty of parking the wait staff was very friendly and the food came fast not much ambiance but you re kind of looking for that from time to time
  since moving to lv my husband and i have searched for a great philly cheese we ve tried a few places including pops which was by far the worst we had then we found hanks best in town friendliest owners on the planet plus they use real wiz we had their special 12 for 8 99 not sure if this special is everyday great price bread was fresh and had a great crust meat was amazing and again the wiz even our kids loved it finally we have found our spot we will be returning and spreading the word that hanks is the place to go
  they don t take reservations for less than eight people and it s always slammed for dinner so if you d like to wait an hour for your party of 7 or fewer to eat go right ahead and eat here i m sure this place is good for gilbert but i can get reservations at any restaurant in kierland on short notice do yourself a favor and make the drive half an hour north for better food and customer service
  this is one of my favorite asian restaurants in pittsburgh most of their dishes taste very good at the beginning i went there for chunk chicken but now i usually order fish filet with basil or seafood with basil chow fun and pan fried noodles taste so good as well
  i ordered the rockefeller reuben and as always it was fresh hot and amazingly delicious the team working seemed to get to my order right away and i received my food within 5 minutes of ordering great sandwich great service what else can you ask for
  this particular firehouse sub s is located inside concord mills mall however i was so happy there was not a line it was pretty easy to decide what i want and i believe all of their subs are served hot unless requested cold the bread was really fresh and tasty just the right thickness and airiness they had an abundance of sauces to add to your sub like seriously a crap ton of sauces from all over the world sriracha mexican sauces bbq etc i was really craving a subway sandwich but this was the next best option despite my skepticism this was really good i would go back lastly i want to close out my reivew with a really unique and charitable requst they make so as you might guess by the name it withas founded in the 90 s by two brothers i think who were firemen and firehouse chefs they opened a restaurant and the chain took off in keeping with their roots they ask you if you want to round up to donate to first responders i love this rather than asking if you want to donate 1 5 etc dollars to a charity they simply ask if you want to round up your amount to the next dollar i like this because i imagine a lot of people say sure and i imagine it adds up very clever charityissexy
  my wife and i ate there and came away extremely impressed we got smoked chicken pulled pork and their sausage links and all of it was extremely well done their sauce is spicy but not to the point of just pure heat the meat was all tender and the portions were plenty big service kept us full on drinks offered suggestions with what to try and brought us more cheese biscuits as soon as our basket was empty while we understand its a chain the food and service did not feel anything like that great time had there
  best pho in madison
  been going here for years it s always busy and you think my god i m going to wait forever it s never as bad as it looks staff is fast and efficient amazing portions go for a walk after your done kee up the good work
  without a doubt my favorite pub in the city as a proud member of the irn bruisers pub quiz team i found myself at the green mantle frequently the mantle boasts a down to earth homey vibe and a great selection of beer in addition to all the classics they rotate in a few different beers every month if you re looking for everything a pub should be look no further than the green mantle
  i love this place not just because of the history of this manager and staff and their loyalty to each other but also because the food is good and amazingly cheap lunch there is my favorite i can get a table by myself and sit and read over a glass of wine delicious food i love the wrap and excellent service i have never had anything on the menu i wasn t totally satisfied with fun ambiance and terrific patio also extremely easy parking
  love love love the food everytime i go no complaints and to be a chain restaurant they are on point can t add anything to this dont change what you re doing it s working quite well
